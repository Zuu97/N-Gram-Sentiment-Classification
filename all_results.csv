no,no,no,"I suddenly have it for almost 3 months, and it's awful. Battery works for several hours. Photos looks like the're sharpen too much by program, so they're useless. Internet applications like Chrome or build-in one are very buggy. UI is very laggy. I definitely recover from buiyng it."
yes,no,yes,"I was totaly satisfied with my Note 4 until I upgraded it to the latest software version. (5.0.1) Since then it is lagging sometimes, and randomly losts the internet connection. If you buy one, I recommend to wait for the next version before you upgrade it."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had the Galaxy Note 4 for about 6 months now. The phone never ceases to amaze me. In my opinion I would take this phone over any iphone for a few key reasons. One major reason is the expandable memory which is almost needed for any user who would like a music library, movie collection, or..."

yes,yes,yes,"This is an excellent product, with a large quality screen. The phone is also pretty durable as I have dropped mine several times without a scratch or dent..

yes,yes,yes,It’s almost a perfect phone. The phone does everything and more. With that being said there are a few things Samsung could fix on their phones. I will get into that later. WARNING- this is a long post that might be boring….. Screen- Best screen I’ve ever seen on a phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I like dis phone, and I like s pen. I wish more templates on snotes or at least to have an option to make your own."
yes,no,yes,"One thing that bothers me is no Camera Api 2.0 and the battery could be a bit better. Other than that, the screen is fantastic, as is the camera. Picture quality is great! Signal is pretty solid, with 4G+ speed beeing very good."
yes,yes,yes,"I have have been using this phone as my daily driver for about 5 months now, this is obviously a long time in the fast paced mobile phone world, however I have had many experiences in my extensive use of the product."
yes,yes,yes,I have had my Note for 6 months now and its simply flawless!
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is amazing, currently I have been using it for about 4 months, and I could not be happier, the battery life is awesome, it has a great screen, th S- pen comes handy when needed, and so far it hasn't had any OS crashes or bugs."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung GALAXY Note 4 has a 3 GB DDR4 Ram with 32 GB Internal storage. A 2.7 GHz Quad Core processor to power it more consistently. What i love about the Galaxy Note 4 is its Display and Awesomeness. Although the Battery lasts for exactly half a day with heavy use its still a good Smart phone.
yes,yes,yes,"After patiently waiting since SII through S3,S4,S5 and now S6 with or without edge this is still the best of Samung available. Awesome design, very elegant and not just because I chose the model in Gold."
yes,yes,yes,"I used this phone for a few days already and I really like the size, the camera, the stylus and how apps work. The note 4 has everything but is not polished. Fingerprint scanner - more miss than hit Screen - I don t like the colours when the screen is at a low brightness, but such a high resolution..."
yes,yes,yes,"in the midst of researching my next smartphone, I found out I could upgrade on the Verizon Edge plan 4 months early. the proud owner of the Galaxy S4, I wasn't in a terrible hurry, and the Galaxy S6 had just been announced."
yes,yes,yes,Nice big phone. I have huge hands and fingers ideal for me. Fast for texting good all round phone. Battery strength could be better best phone i have had. Beats my sony anytime. Cannot wait for the Note 5. Buy this phone or get it on contract you will not be disappionted.
no,no,no,The note 4 is appalling. The keyboard is shoddy autocorrect doesn't work and doesn't let you type what you want and the operating system omg is it rubish
yes,yes,yes,"this is an amazing phone although it could be cheaper, the processor could be faster. a part from that great phone."
no,no,no,"phone heats up, battery drains fast. started using it last january 19, 2015."
yes,yes,yes,"Simply an incredible phone, the more you learn about it the more you find it can do. Powerfully fast, great camera, versatile, s pen is not a gimmick it really does add value to use. The only downside is the camera protrudes out so be careful in case you drop it, get a good case."
yes,yes,yes,"Really a great device. only problem is with software.. else everything is excellent. no performance issues... great camera.. good build quality.... if samsung pushes the galaxy s6 software into note 4,then it will be great.... lets see what next come in Note 5......eagerly waiting for Note 5..."
yes,yes,yes,Nothing comes close to the utility of this phone. I love the multitasking feature of this phone and I absolutely adore the S-Pen! It's made my life much easier as I no longer have to carry a small notepad with me whenever I work.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had many Android phones and only one iPhone, but this is beyond the best phone I ever had! Its worth the money! I have the ATT version so I have to wait 20 years for an update but Kitkat is pretty good! The S-pen is very handy!"
yes,no,yes,"Stellar performance,good build quality and respectable battery. But still had kitkat and I don't know when my device(n9100h) going to be updated to lollipop. Sometimes the fingerprint id isn't working and take too much try to unlock the screen."
yes,yes,yes,"It is a great phone with obvious improvements from Note 3, I've never used any phblets heavily but this phone has successfully dragged me in to use one. Guess what,it didn't fail me."
yes,yes,yes,A high end smartphone with great features and value for money. The phone deliver the same performance I had assumed considering preceding model i.e. note 3. I am sure this phone will note disappoint anyone who is looking for a complete package.
yes,yes,yes,"A phone filled with a plenty of features!! Two weeks after getting the note 4, I’m still discovering new features and new functions! it’s awesome. Apart his known features (Spen, Photo Note, Fast charging,…), there is a very useful hidden ones."
yes,yes,yes,"To start in my opinion its a good basic phone , easy to download applications and easy to use. I have had this phone for three months now and i feel that there are a few things that could be improved. The battery doesn't actually last very long and my phone keeps freezing."
yes,yes,yes,The S Pen is amazing and the screen display! The battery lats long and charges really quickly. Its worth it
yes,yes,yes,One of the best phones ever made! The Exynos doesn't skip a beat with the gargantuan display and love the features such as Private Mode etc making even TW likeable :) I am not a fanboy of either iOS nor Android and have swapped quite frequently between the two since the last few years but i do...
yes,yes,yes,Does everything very well. Not cheap but worth it.
yes,yes,yes,Does everything very well. Not cheap but worth it.
yes,yes,yes,"i had a sony xperia v then traded it for a galaxy s3, now i got my self the note 4 and i'm truly happy with the phone the battery lasts me 2 days without power saving mode i'm not a heavy user as you can think but the s3 lasted me one day and the v not even a day i was overwhelmed by the size at..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great all round phone, with awesome features. With the 3GB of RAM the multitasking features work seamlessly. The s-pen is one of a kind making this phone stand out from all the other out on the market. It is simply the best."
yes,yes,yes,"The Best of the best phablet.It has every thing you need in a phablet.it have 2K screen,stylus pen,S note app,beast camera with 4K,16mp and 1080p at 60 fps and optical image stabilization,big battery,front camera with 3.7 and wide pic,fast charge and a lot of things that you need."
yes,yes,yes,Note 4 has very features and specs that I have been looking for. Loving it.
yes,yes,yes,Its the best phone iv ever used!!! it beats the iphone by far! its great phone with great screen and build quality and battery life and gaming performance ! its just perfect and its the phone that i reccomend everyone to get and you will not go wrong with it :)
yes,yes,yes,"Went from my note 3 to an S5. Big mistake! Now I'm back on track again with my note 4. Great phone fast, screen size perfect for me. I'm a chef so I take a lot of notes for myself to remember recipes etc. Not switching phones till the note 5."
no,yes,yes,Crashed and lagged on me for MORE than 20x and i got it a MONTH ago... barely have any files on my phone.. such a disappointment. &#58;-(
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy note 4 is the flagship Samsung phone. coming in at number 1 for 2014 phones, the Note 4 falls under the sub-smartphone catagory of phablet (phone tablet) because of the screen size and range of features."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing the phone has an amazing screen once I switched on for the first time the screen blew me away. The phone has a lot of features on the phone from multitasking which takes advantage of the big screen for example I could be watching youtube videos and replying to emails at the...

The phone has a lot of features on the phone from multitasking which takes advantage of the big screen for example I could be watching youtube videos and replying to emails at the...
yes,yes,yes,"Build quality is great, only better devices in terms of built is iphone 6 and m8. Reception is just fine call quality is great internet is fast and browsers are great such as multimedia with the speaker being nice.(others are in the scoreboard down below)"
yes,yes,yes,Ive been using it since a month now. Very satisfied with the build quality for the first time. Display is amazing. Worth spending your money. I was regular buyer of samsung galaxy series but i skipped galaxy s5 for its ugly looks and shifted to htc m8 which was beautiful and at the same performer in...
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. The Note 4 does everything that the Note 3 did and much more. The display is so clear and lifelike, it is like looking out of a window rather than looking at a screen. The camera is better than the Note 3."
yes,yes,yes,"I just switched cell providers and decided to get the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. I had the Note 3 prior to this. The Note 4 is a lot like the Note 3 except the display is much better, the camera takes better pictures and I think the new UI looks better. The S-pen also functions better and has more uses."
yes,yes,yes,"Ive had the Note 2 for 2 years (which I loved) and recently upgraded to the Note 4.  When I first turned on the Note 4 I was blown away by the display, its truly stunning!  Im still working my way through the phones features, but so far I love the S Pen enhancements, the fast charging features, the..."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone is the note 4 i had before a note 3 if we talking about speed you didnt see much difference but the hardware had a big revolution and in al lot of point you see a big differnece. The battery life is more than I can ask for. Screen size is great. It feels comfortable in my hands.
yes,yes,yes,"I have yet to experience any flaws in this phone. Also as a professional photographer, i have to say that the camera is amazing. Best camera on a phone, ever! I love how quickly the phone charges and the phone itself works smoothly, even the content on the micro sd card open up without hitches"
yes,yes,yes,"Truly amazing! everything from screen to camera to build quality is top notch. this monster excels nearly in every way except maybe for design...though great for me some people are still unsatisfied. tghe screen is exceptional, you hae to see to believe it."
yes,yes,yes,"the note 4 is a beast in the spec department, but samsung's touchwiz ruins the phone. this phone has a great camera and a great battery. the build quality is great, but the back is a disaster with its pores"
yes,yes,yes,Mine is the Exynos version. It is an awesome phone. The camera is just stuning and beautiful.The battery drains quite fast thou but the fast charging really helpful. It does not Lag at all and the TouchWiz in the Note 4 quite nice actually.
yes,yes,yes,"Where to start? I guess with build. Well after owning the previous 2 notes, I can confidently say it's as close to perfect an android phone has ever been (I don't consider non sd and removable battery phones at all). The metal frame is gorgeous."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best smartphone I have ever had. So much, as I am still learning. So far, the battery has been great. Display is awesome! Reception and call quality has been very impressive. Like this phone more than any I have had, even with the big screen."
yes,yes,yes,About 10 days on this beast and I have fallen deeply in love with it! Hope to keep it as my daily driver for the next 2 years. The good is that I wasn't fooled by my friends recommending to go for the iphone 6! Haha
yes,no,yes,Best thing of the year I don't know what is wrong with people these days who are preferring iphone over this phone clearly this phone is the king of smartphones I am really enjoying this thing I had an iphone but this thing is different
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone. It can do anything you can think of!!! 4k video, mulitscreen, new s pen features, panoramic selfies, the best camera features on the market, one-handed mode, easy mode (if some of this seems a little overwhelming), just to name a few."
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect, phone. I could not find any other phone so ideal for me. Samsung hit it out of the park with this one. This is the phone you have been looking for all your life. It's an entirely adaptive experience that is only comparable to Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone feels good in my hand and fits in my pocket just fine. The display is very sharp and a big improvement over the Note 2 display. I don't like how the camera protrudes out the back of the phone, a case might fix this problem. I wasn't sure this phone was going to replace my note 2."
yes,yes,yes,best phone ever.why would any one try to compare to iphone
yes,yes,yes,This phone is a complete beast. If you do not mind the size it is definitely the best phone on the market. The pen is also extremely useful and can use for many tasks such as copying and pasting as well as just browsing the web.
yes,yes,yes,This is the most amazing phone I've ever owned. I research all things before I purchase and this one exceeds my expectations! Battery life is great! All day and have 75% left when I get home from work. In new home construction so I use it a lot. Camera is so clear with crisp colors! It's amazing!
yes,yes,yes,I just got this phone last week Wednesday. This is a major upgrade from the Motorola Photon Q I had. I've only had slider phones prior to this and was expecting to have a hard time transitioning to an all touchscreen. Man was I wrong. The battery life is more than I can ask for.
yes,yes,yes,It is currently one of the best Phablet. S pen stylus functionality has increased and it felt very good to work with. Thanks to quad-core processor and 3 GB of RAM seems unlikely that you have a problem with the phone hangs.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone well built just superb very very very superb stylus works great companion for overall experience display is sharp and vividly colourful processor is great as well Overall a great phone worth buying
yes,yes,yes,Samsung is one of the best company now a days.... because no one beat their features and there is no company who can beat them
yes,yes,yes,"Love the big screen, love the ease to upload my custom ringtones or pictures (no itunes in the middle), love the camera, 16 megapixel and 8x zoom did for me what my old 8mpix Iphone4S never could! love the fingerprint security.I hear the note 3 has a 10000 Mah battery?"
yes,yes,yes,Hard to choose where to start. Design/Build Quality. For me metal doesn't make a difference as I have the Note 3. I gave it an 8 because I hate that they paint the sides when it could have simply been all chrome. It may as well had been plastic if you're gonna paint it.
yes,yes,yes,"Totally dig the device, especially the S Pen. But, man, the TouchWiz interface is super kitschy and the way the screen displays is downright garish. It's like a huge piece of functional super-sweet candy. It's got a sturdy build, but that leatherette back is so cheesy."
yes,yes,yes,"I was never a fan of Samsung nor phablet but Galaxy Note4 is to love! Especially when I work in design field and I usually have to take the note. All the feature fits from a entrepeneur s, freelancers, to college students. I don't need to be technology saavy to find the feature useful."
yes,no,yes,"so much improve from galaxy note3 better camera (both front and rare), image quality are soooo good even I turn off beauty mode. screen quality is perfect. the most impressive function goes to battery and ultra power saving mode >> it's safe my life! I can live a day without battery charger now."
yes,yes,yes,"Galaxy Note 4 is a beast of a phone! Love it. Call quality is clear and crisp, the build of the phone is WAY better than Galaxy S 5. Camera is excellent. Just and overall excellent phone. Battery life is spectacular! My best phone so far."
yes,no,yes,"Had the note 3 before, much enhanced phone than note 3. Great changes have been made especially to the quality and interface. Touch wiz still lags the device but its still much enhanced than the previous version."
yes,yes,yes,Man ! That phone blew me away! Was waiting for the Nexus 6 but the Note series is the best at the phablet category! Best QHD Display I've ever seen! The Exynos version is 64-bit (maybe will Samsung unlock that feature in Android L) S Pen every phablet needs it!
yes,yes,yes,"going to balance this out, since some iphone fans rated this 0. When you unbox this beast, first thing you notice are the metal sides shining at you, when you wrap those covers out and take the device on your hand you really feel the perfect balance of premium and grip."
yes,yes,yes,its a excellent phone.. the very best on the market at the moment. almost like a litte pc. the display and the looks of the phone is just great - i simply love it. and belive it or not its one of the most bestlooking phone out there!
yes,yes,yes,Average phone not awesome but good.price is very high compared to its features offered.nexus 6 will be a good alternative.but value for money if you look go for lg g3-the best phone of 2014.stylus is the remarkable feature.
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung has out did themselevs with this Note 4 Awesome, Awesome.. phone quality is great, Samsung could have really killed it if they would have released all the colrs like they said on 9/3/14. Overall best large smartphone on the market hands down."
yes,yes,yes,The note 4 just kicked it up a bit the screen is amazing the new os look just great really fast with the t mobil 4g lte runs like a transformer Optimus prime just the best out there. Haf an Iphone 6 thanks to the 15 day policy i turned it in and got a note 4 just did the best thing in my life.
yes,yes,yes,So after reading some of the reviews I thought I would post mine. For those that don't like change I can see why they might be a little hard on their review of the phone. In all honesty the phone is an improvement over the fantastic Note 3.
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic phone, a real powerhouse with a huge battery making it last all day long. Great camera, and build. Sturdy build, nothing cheap like the new iphone. Display is amazing, zero complaints about it. The 1440p and dimness to 1 nit is incredible"
no,yes,no,"I like the design, battery sucks as it drains every 30-60 sec every time in use or even when not in use, speaker not loud, lag, complicated to understand, fragile but great look qaulity. I am 60% satisifed with this phone not as I was hoping for 90% or above."
yes,yes,yes,"The more I use this phone, the more I get impressed. The screen display quality is superb. The S-pen and Multi-window implementations are terrific. The build quality while preserving the battery/memory card access is top notch. The best all-around smartphone, bar none!"
yes,yes,yes,Great ogle been using it for a week the screen is amazing and the phone is super quick I wad surprised with AL the apps I babe that it hasn't slowed down. Love having the metal it makes the phone feel better not cheap metal like the iPhone I had in the past.
no,no,no,"Thank goodness for return policies! The resolution is such a non issue. It is also a pentile display so do the math (= not so much). I gave it a shot since it was a super AMOLED screen, but I was wrong. This phone's screen is barely better than the G3's."
yes,yes,yes,"it is a new phone and all, but I have both note :the note 3 and 4, and since my point of view the note 4 do the same , the UI in note 3 looks more professional , note 4 is so colorful ( so that it looks to me like a kid toy ) in brief, if you have note 3 there is not need for upgrade, and if you..."
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone big fast and all goodies not all metal but the lether plasticnice too one of the best the but you should check other phones you may like more but amzing Build quality: great. Reception: very nice. Call quality: very nice. Internet: smooth. Multimedia: perfect! Camera: perfect!
yes,yes,yes,"First up, screen size. The original Note came with a 5.3-incher, the Note 2 showed up with a 5.5-inch display and the Note 3 pushed things to 5.7 inches. Going by this logic the Galaxy Note 4 should have come with a 5.9-inch display, which would see it match the HTC One Max and LG G Pro 2, while..."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is the best smarthpone ( phablet ) im the world! The build quality is very very good with an superb design. The QHD Super Amoled display is the best in the world. The processor is the best in the world. Battery life is very good. The camera is very good.

yes,yes,yes,"I have completed two years with my Note 4. It's the last best note device made by Samsung (considering the Note 7 disaster). It handles everything, gives a backup of 12 hours with moderate usage, hangs and restarts itself very seldom (last time hanged three months back), elegant design, good primary..."
yes,yes,yes,40k for this 2014 model is not a worthy deal! Everyone will prefer ONE PLUS 3T which is available for 30k which is awesome & much latest than 3 years old Note 4! Better make the price of Note 4 to 30k or 27k then it might get sold!
yes,yes,yes,It's better at 30 000 not at 40 000
yes,yes,yes,"The best phone I have used till date. I have been using my Note 4 for the past 2 years. Flow less performance,Premium looks and good battery life."

yes,yes,yes,"The Note 4 is touted as the ideal replacement to the Note 3. Ideal it is if you replace chalk with cheese. Except for the Quad HD display, which in the real world means nothing at all, expect to bring out all the details alive on pre-loaded wallpapers, it DOESN'T mean a thing at all."
yes,yes,yes,It's the behind of good bye days to Samsung
yes,no,yes,"On my particular Samsung Note 4 the interface color choice is either white and orange, grayscale, two settings for colorblindness or inverted. The only thing worse than Samsung Note color choices are those color choices inverted."
yes,no,yes,"loved my Note4 for its camera, design and the stylus. Good to see they upgraded everything and espcially the camera features looks pretty impressive. I am not sure why dropped my most used feature remote control. everyone in my home has Samusng devices and they use remote app every now and then."
yes,yes,yes,"SHORT N SWEET...LG G3 WAS GREAT, THIS IS AMAZING...IVE HAD OVER 15 SMART PHONES, NOT ONE COMPARES TO THIS. ADDED A 10,000 MAH BATTERY PACK.CASE 69.99 FROM EBAY, CHARGE PHONE EVERY 5 DAYS. I LIKE LARGE PHONES, AND THE NEW BATTERY ADDS 6 OUNCES AND I LIKE THAT TOO. I PREFER BULK IN MY HAND."
yes,no,yes,"I love this phone. I had an iPhone 6 that I traded for the Note 4, and I immediately fell for the stylus. I love being able to take handwritten notes and have them converted to a more readable format. The battery life is good. I do have to charge it daily, but I am a very heavy user."
yes,yes,yes,"I discovered the Galaxy Note 4 one day while I was watching TV. The product looked very interesting and it caught my attention. I was in need of a new phone, so I decided I would get the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. It did not disappoint me at all."
yes,yes,yes,"Check out comparative study between Note 4 , HTC , Xperia Z3"
yes,no,yes,"Aside from the good display, this phone doesn't have much going for it"
yes,yes,yes,"This is one of the finest phones I've ever owned. It's lightning fast, sips the battery, and has features that other phablets would be wise to emulate."
yes,yes,yes,"*The actual screen is the next most obvious asset this phone has to offer. It's big, bright, colorful and super sharp. Those extra pixels might be too close together for my eye to focus on, but they do make little details show up nicely."
no,no,yes,"This is my second Samsung note 4 phone, the first one would constantly drop calls when I try to answer phone, and in the middle of my conversations. Also when I would try to look at my pictures , screen would freeze."
yes,yes,yes,"Long story short, this is the best phone that has ever been made!"
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from a Galaxy S4 four weeks ago to the Note 4. Holy bejeezus I was not expecting to fall so hard for this baby. I was reluctant to choose the Note over the larger size but it's turned out to be a complete non-issue.

no,no,yes,Note: this is a factory-unlocked Snapdragon 805 variant
yes,yes,yes,"As a T-mobile customer, I received my Note 4 last week. The phone is solid and feels great in the hand. As I am one of those people that does not mind the ""plastic"" of past Samsung phones, I was happy that the addition of metal did not make the phone uncomfortably heavy."
yes,no,yes,Still needs improvements. Not convinced to purchase one.
yes,yes,yes,"Finally, after numerous leaks, rumors and speculations, the fourth generation Samsung phablet – Galaxy Note 4 has been launched. DISPLAY : The display is yet another highlight of the Galaxy Note 4 as it flaunts of an extraordinary 5.7 inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display that boasts of a screen..."
yes,yes,yes,"A phablet (avoid if you prefer using your phone with one hand) that has expandable storage, removable back panel to change battery pack, with quad hd screen (best among all phablets). I used S6 for a year before giving it to wife, and ended up buying Note 4."

Distinctive Features : CRISPY CLEAR SOUND FROM HEADSET EXCELLENT LOUD SPEAKER VERY CLARITY ON FRONT FACING CAM REAR CAMERA AWESOME VERY GOOD TOUCH SENSITIVITY PUNCHY BATTERY BACKUP FAST CHARGING VERY GOOD IN HURRY VERY DECENT LOOK.. TILL NOW I FOUND NO CONS.
no,no,no,I agree with Mr. Vijay Kumar Jain. I bought this fone exactly a month ago and it gets heated up to very uncomfortable temperatures. In fact Samsung should market it as a heater rather than mobile. It is very slow and apps crash frequently. Only solace being Samsung's good after sales service.

yes,yes,yes,I love this phone its amazing if any one for resale contect me

Beautiful Design, silver like cutting at the edges.Very thin compared to previous versions. 3. Camera is awesome. Pictures always bright."
yes,yes,yes,"If you want something with a large screen , mind blowing performance and premium features. I would only say one thing ""Take a note of this masterpiece"" . display: The 5.7 inch,Super Amoled screen is exceptional and the best so far of any smartphone. Quad HD resolution of 2560x1440 pixels, 515 ppi."
yes,yes,yes,Superb Phone with mind blowing features. Rocking performance. Its a privilege to own a phone like this. Hats off to SAMSUNG.
yes,yes,yes,I got this device on 21st October and let me tell you that this has stood firm on its expectations. It has lot of industry first features and the S Pen feature is unthinkable. In just about 7 days I am very addicted to this device.
yes,yes,yes,"If you want something with a large screen , mind blowing performance and premium features. I would only say one thing ""Take a note of this masterpiece"" . display: The 5.7 inch,Super Amoled screen is exceptional and the best so far of any smartphone. Quad HD resolution of 2560x1440 pixels, 515 ppi."
yes,yes,yes,Product is awesome. Pricing should be 10K lesser than the current price
yes,no,yes,Amazing but overpriced must be around 49k then it will sell like hot cakes
yes,yes,yes,"I was a little skeptical about ordering from this company because I never heard of them before. However, after reading several good reviews on this phone; I just had to take a chance. I placed my order for this phone on a Monday and received it on Wednesday."
yes,no,yes,"The phone itself is fine, but please check battery right after you receive this. Mine had a battery drain issue but I found it after 30 days and BnH won't cover the battery after 30 days. Let the battery go below 50% and operate the phone to see if it doesn't drain."
yes,no,no,"The Note 4 is beautiful to look at, its vivid screen and larger dimensions make it easier to use as a working tool instead of just a recreational device. After almost two months of use I think - I hope - I've worked out the bugs in the Android configuration so that it doesn't crash."
no,yes,no,"After waiting for this phone to arrive about a week, it's seems like it's brand new but it's DOA. What a waste of time and you will have to pay for return shipping even it's defective."
no,no,no,"It looked promising after setting all up until it started getting hot. The phone did not appear to have been defective from what I could tell, hence I assume it simply runs hot by way of normal operation."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone for my daughter and I already had one for myself. We are both happy with Note 4 functions and great camera. Also the memory can be expanded to up to 128 Gb with SD card which is a very affordable option.
yes,yes,yes,I use this to replace my old Palm pilot as well as a phone in Spain.
yes,yes,yes,"I use it to make calls, text messages, emails, browsing, S pen to take notes. The above functions work great. Samsung keyboard is a pain when texting: any new words I type do not get saved automatically. The battery holds good for a long day which is great. Camera works up to the mark."
yes,no,yes,Battery runs out very quickly
no,yes,no,"I bougth this cell phone 2 week ago and i am having lot of problems. The battery works bad, the cell phone doesnt recognize my headphones, and now the camera is working really bad the focus doesnt work so i cant take photos."

yes,yes,yes,This note 4 was a huge upgrade for me! Going from an iPhone 4 to the note 4 was an easy transition to android. Didn't take very long to switch all my data over to the new phone. And now I'm wishing I would have switched sooner.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from an older Note and am totally satisfied with this Note 4. It does everything I want to do with a smart phone and more.
yes,yes,yes,"Screen is much sharper than Note3 due to higher pixel per inch. Holds its own against most ""current"" phone offerings that cost more."
yes,yes,yes,I looked at several places for this specific phone. Love that it is unlocked AT&T it works great with my network and functions great. Love the S-pen and all the great functions.
yes,yes,yes,This product is the one I am looking for my daily use now I am enjoying with my new note phone
yes,yes,yes,"Has SD card and removable battery, great camera, great screen. Charges fast and really good battery life. Only beef is the AT&T bloatware installed but this can be disabled with a little knowledge."
yes,yes,yes,Love my new phone??
yes,yes,yes,This phone is incredible! Smart - easy to understand - Multitasking
yes,yes,yes,Funcionamiento correcto y buena vision de pantalla. Quizas un poco costoso su valor y su rapida depresiacion en el mercado.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has a beautiful display and is plenty fast. I also got the wireless charging cover, which is great."
no,yes,no,"My Galaxy Note 4 worked beautifully for the first six months. Suddenly, for no apparent reason the display went black and would not power on. Naturally I thought the phone was out of charge but that was not the case. I called Samsung and they told me to send in the phone for analysis and repair."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great all around. The camera quality is better than note 3, my 64gb works in this phone where it did not work in note 3. Its like a lab top computer with a nice size screen and with 4g lte internet speeds from straight talk (sim card purchased from straight talk) you can't beat it."
yes,yes,yes,I had an s4 and I though it was a great phone. This one it is even better. I am in love with it. It is an awesome divece.
yes,yes,yes,Best costumer service.
yes,yes,yes,This works really good with metro pcs service very easy to set up and install. Only problem that I have now is the multimedia message take very long to send or may not be send. Great phone por many purposes.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone of 2014 and still a top competitor. Size isn't an issue with this phone. The one handed mode is easy to use and textured back ensures a firm grip.
no,no,yes,"Pretty sure they put an after market screen in this device do to the fact the adhesive failed and the entire screen fell out plus the s pen never worked, tried 3 different s pens none worked."
yes,no,yes,The phone did not come with the stylus
no,no,no,DO NOT BUY. Phone doesn't work right and it is a blacklisted phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone was in really good shape, but had a few ""quirks"". I noticed the stylus didn't work, but thankfully, I never use it anyway. Great deal on an otherwise very nice phone."
yes,yes,yes,"It may not be the fruit phone, but it is sweet! Have you been questioning whether you should get an Apple or Samsung phone? Stop questioning it because the Galaxy Note 5 is the perfect phone to meet all of your needs."
yes,yes,yes,Note 4 for a great price!
no,no,no,The product was received damaged
yes,yes,yes,I’ve had the phone for ten days now and given it what I consider a thorough run-in so here’s my quick review. I don’t normally write these but felt I had to for a couple of good reasons.
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant phone with so many features that I am still trying to work my way through. It is a misnomer to call it a phone. It is a computer!! And gold colour tops it all...looks the part. I would highly recommend this 'computer'..
yes,yes,yes,"A great Phone I have Note 3 and want to change to note 4 , but Why is this advertised cheaper by others ?"
no,no,yes,520 in eBay.price is to high in amazone. Don't buy from them .
yes,no,yes,Absolutely taking the ♥♥♥♥ at this price
yes,yes,yes,Nothing to say but what a phone cant wait to see the 5
yes,yes,yes,Very good product. Made the right choice.
yes,yes,yes,Almost fullfiled my expectations. Love the improved quality of its design and sharp screen. Only dislike that the Spen app (serves to take notes) doesnt have the tool that allows perfectly straight lines and geometric shapes. Why to remove such a usefull drawing tool ?
yes,yes,yes,can't fault this phone its great
yes,yes,yes,Good quality case. A touch expensive for what it is.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone
yes,yes,yes,"After reading all this reviews, I can't wait to get my hand on my new Note 4...yey!"
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone - best of all is the stylus
yes,yes,yes,TOP TO TOP VERY VERY VERY GOOD LOVE IT
no,no,no,"I had a faulty Bluetooth Radio. The Bluetooth connected well for phone call use, but for music it was terrible. At times the music will play fine via Car System Bluetooth but it will then cut out and no music will come through."
yes,yes,yes,"Just as predicted a superb phone and just a step up from Note 3, which was also very good. To be recommended.So many features and tricks to learn. What fun."
yes,yes,yes,I put Samsung galaxy note 4 and this what I get today that's all I get
yes,yes,yes,Great large screen has everything you need in android superb
yes,yes,yes,I have always loved these but sadly I have been let down. The battery power is appalling. It never lasts a day.
yes,yes,yes,love this phone!! replaced my old s4 and i have not looked back
yes,yes,yes,"This was my very first smart phone and, after much research, I decided on the Samsung S5. However, I couldn't source a new one and didn't want a second-hand one so chose the Note 4 instead. I'm really pleased with it."
yes,no,yes,Once you get hooked on the Note series it becomes difficult to look elsewhere. Used the Note three for about 3 years and needed to upgrade. This is a slight improvement over the Note 3 and in my opinion still an awesome phone.
yes,yes,yes,Phone is long rather than wide which makes it easier to hold but harder to fit into a pocket. It has all the functions I need and a 182 page user guide which is not included with the phone.
yes,yes,yes,There's not much to say apart from its an excellent phone.. short and simple.. check out the YouTube videos..
yes,no,yes,We love the Galaxy Notes and this was to replace a 3yr old Note 2. Again easy to Navigate and clear bright screen.
yes,yes,yes,Top service Top phone
yes,yes,yes,Najlepszy na swiecie !!!
yes,yes,yes,"Previously I wrote a good review...but a couple of months later this phone has a massive lag when unlocking and occasionally at other times too. I don't have many apps installed and everything is up to date etc. Animations, gestures, s voice etc are all disabled too."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is a giant. Lovely big phone for big man-hands. It's more of a mini tablet than a phone really.
yes,yes,yes,works as expected.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, no problems at all."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone at a goof price. Recommended.
yes,yes,yes,I have been using the note 4. It has been working great.
yes,yes,yes,"Really liking the versatility of this smartphone. It's intuitive (to a certain degree) so easy to use straight away, some things take a little research (if you are 'Technically Challenged' like me). Have just put a 64g card in so will never need to delete a photo or a song ever again!!!"
yes,yes,yes,very good phone from sansung u have a phone and a tablet all in one
yes,yes,yes,I like it very much.
yes,yes,yes,The best I think - gone from s6 edge plus to this and don't regret it
yes,yes,yes,It's an excellent phone. I have not mastered the pen yet but I love the pulse monitor and the step counter keeps me on my toes.
yes,yes,yes,"Great battery life, great screen, great phone."
yes,yes,yes,Best phone ever used. Very snappy and smooth.
yes,yes,yes,Not good as the phone got blocked
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy Note 4 is without doubt the best smartphone I have owned. The screen size and clarity are great and the ability to change the battery is a major selling feature.
yes,yes,yes,"Very good product. The delivery should be faster, it took about 15 days."
yes,yes,yes,The best phone I've ever had. Enough said.
yes,yes,yes,"Super smart can't go wrong with it, excellent built quality works beautifully bought one for my self then my brother who bought Samsung s6 sold his s6 and bought note 4 :) guess why because note 4 is a thousand miles better than s6"
yes,yes,yes,Arrived all okay .up to minute tracking so I could see it coming.Used economy delivery and because it came from France it took about 2 weeks but was cheapest price for this new phone.V Happy
yes,no,yes,"Everything was perfect, no problems with the shipment and also was important...no problems with the phone"
yes,yes,yes,"Why was it set up in Chinese? Otherwise, all as anticipated"
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone fast works a dream
yes,yes,yes,My first smartphone and I am impressed by what it can do. I am in my 70s so I am not going to be a wiz for a while but I am learning everyday. I have not even tried to use the pen yet. The screen is bright and clear and good for older eyes to see.
yes,yes,yes,"Superb phone, especially with the 5.1.1 update. Smooth, fast, perfect."
yes,no,yes,"REALLY GOOD , NOT FOUND ALL THE THINGS IT CAN DO YET !!!!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"What can I say, it's great."
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic product, well worth the money."
yes,no,yes,It's a great mobile but was set up for German use so had to reset for UK and it's now ok Had to wipe off German apps but phone is now ok and a fantastic mobile I recommend the Samsung galaxy note 4 to everyone
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone, good screen."
no,no,no,not working properly. will have to return
yes,yes,yes,Phone is as stated very good condition we still think it was new
yes,yes,yes,". There are a number of good reviews here and I do not want to rehash what has, necessarily been said before, so here is “my 2 pence worth”. Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 excels at everything that seems to matter, it packs Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon chip, the Snapdragon 805."
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this to replace my 5s. I will never go back to apple the build quality is great, the screen is fantastic the built in features are great, I love controlling my household appliances with my phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I moved from iPhone after many years, to Samsung and haven't regretted it one bit as my iPad and the Samsung are quite compatible. This Phablet is wonderful, with its larger screen it is perfect for those of us with challenging eyesight conditions."
yes,yes,yes,Not sure what the reviewer who gave this phone one star is decribing. The phone is just terrific. The chassis (sides) are anodized aluminium and will scratch but don't confuse the Note 4 with the Note 3 which did have chromed plastic sides which could be chipped.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Good size, good battery life and all round good egg."
yes,yes,yes,very good product till date with no problems
yes,yes,yes,quality phone and quality delivery
yes,yes,yes,Wow. Been waiting to get this for a while. Just love it.photography is superb.
yes,yes,yes,"Love it. Pictures are crystal clear. I love writing with the pen. I like my Samsung Galaxies. Chose the Note4 as it has a replaceable battery, unlike the S6, as I keep my phones a long time. Just stopped using my S2 recently."
no,no,no,"I bought this one as a replacement to a phone I had purchased from the Samsung website. After a few hours, I can tell something is not right. I spent so much money on this product, it is going back and I dont want a replacement. The sensor on the phone is not working properly."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Note 4 is still one of the best mobile phones out there with a superb camera that gives clear true picture & video thats sharp and easy to use. The clarity and the larger screen size also makes this Mobile Phone a winner in my eyes.
yes,yes,yes,"Simply because the Note 4 may be the last of the great phones that have user access removable battery and expandable storage. Then there is the stylus pen. I waver between the S6 and this as there is not much differences in the costs between them, and as some may have mentioned, nor the specs..."
yes,yes,yes,"Jumped from Note3 to Note4. Note4 props (compared to Note3): - very good quality (aluminium frame, not like note3 with plastic) - Better s pen pressure (2048 in note4, 1024 note3) - fingerprints reader - a lot better screen - more pixels by inch - a lot better screen resolution - !!"
yes,yes,yes,"Quality phone, good price. Just wish it was a little lighter but then the battery would be smaller. Can't have it both ways I guess!"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent. Better than Note 5. Can insert SD card and replace battery. Also cheaper. No brainer really.
yes,yes,yes,everything as in the item description
yes,no,yes,"Fab love it, had the note 2 and this is just an updated version. Battery needs charging more often but no real issue."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone and I do use the stylus for taking notes. Handy when you haven't got a pen and paper. Battery is amazing and the screen brilliant. Other phones now seem tiny!!
yes,yes,yes,"All absolutely perfect, great phone and everything as advertised. Dispatched and received quickly."
no,no,no,Ended up returning WiFi wouldn't work
yes,yes,yes,Amazing product. i just upgraded from my old note 2 which served me well for 2 years now. I am not disappointed at all. The phone is super fast and lives up to the hype of the flagship galaxy note range. If you are thinking of this then buy one and you will not be disappointed.
no,no,no,"The first issue I had was the fact that there was no cover on the stylus, the electronics were exposed via a small hole? Secondly the supplied charger (or cable) didn't work. The phone simply pulse vibrated when plugged in. Another cable and charger worked fine."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic powerful phone with a beautifully clear screen. I always use Nova Launcher to set up exactly how I want and would recommend this to others who are fussy. Lovely big phone that does everything you want it to.
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful factory sealed item. This was the 8 core Exynos 1.9GHz version rather than the 4 core 2.7GHz Snapdragon.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Great service
yes,yes,yes,"Bought for my wife. Excellent phone. Better screen than my iPhone 6. Fast, powerful, beautifully made. Great aluminium structure, feels very high quality. Much nicer than the note 2s we used to have."
yes,yes,yes,Why do I have ment to be brand new device but it's been rooted?
yes,yes,yes,This is by far the best phone I have ever had. Would recommend. Good gast delivery.
yes,yes,yes,Love it. Just what i wanted.
yes,yes,yes,"I have just upgraded from the Note 2, so very similar in a lot of ways, but 100 times better. Stunning display and everything is so fast. Really happy and highly recommend!"
yes,yes,yes,Bought for my partner who wanted a larger screen. He loves it
no,yes,no,"Phone was faulty, so had to send it to repair shop , so got no phone for 10 days."
yes,yes,yes,Very quick service. Phone was a gift and no complaints so far.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is excellent
yes,no,yes,"Absolutely nothing to object to this device, which I bought as a replacement to my also superb Note 2. The plus of this item in comparison to the Note 5 is that it has removable battery (with a spare you will never worry about being left without juice) and the additional SD card slot to expand..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Only issue is the size when carrying it about, you get use to it though."
no,no,no,received wrong phone absolutely gutted... immediately asked for a refund.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone at a great price, very happy"
yes,yes,yes,Perfect product.
yes,yes,yes,"See my review for O2, I am very pleased with this phone, it is a replacement for my Samsung S4 mini, I wanted a bigger screen and the S pen for some of my art work - takes great pictures, not one would convince me to go back to Apple, my second Samsung and also Samsung tab. Great product."
yes,yes,yes,"Very pleased with Note 4 however I'm still exploring, When I finished I shall give my final review."
yes,yes,yes,"There are enough other excellent detailed reviews, so I'll just add a few points I noticed which I didn't read elsewhere: Coming from the original Galaxy Note, the Note 4 homescreen - despite its larger size and higher resolution - actually displays a LOT less."
yes,yes,yes,Great stuff..thanks
yes,yes,yes,"I've just upgraded from the LG G3 to this, there are a lot of comparisons with the LG G3 because they both have similar specs from the 1440p screen to the ""Phablet"" status of the phone, although this phone is a lot newer."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, loads of features, good battery life."
yes,yes,yes,love it. big screen and clear display. beautiful
yes,yes,yes,Samsung and there home buttons....
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned the Note 4 in white for 4 months now and in short, I am thoroughly pleased with it. I've split my review into the following sections: -Build -Hardware -Software ---Build--- As a previous owner of the LG G2 and LG G3, I have been consistently let down by the poor build material choices."
yes,yes,yes,"Epic phone- battery lasts for ages and it doesn't disappoint. Samsung have engineered a winner with this Note 4. Be careful if you have smudgy hands, the white plastic cover is a magnet for marks- and with it not being waterproof, you can't just rinse it under the tap (like I used to with the Xperia..."
yes,yes,yes,This phone has genuinely increased my productivity by leaps and bounds. You just can't beat the handwritten note taking features once you succumb to the stylus input. No other phone compares in terms of hardware or software so I would definitely recommend for productive professionals!
yes,yes,yes,Best so far. I got Z5 Premium after this recently but I kept this phone instead of Z5.
yes,yes,yes,There is no limit for lies anymore ... i have ask one simple question with no other interpretations : Is the phone UK version ? I got three answears of YES IT IS but is not true ! On the box is wroten with big caracters EUROPEAN VERSION !
yes,yes,yes,Excellent price. Accompanying printed material too small. More info re. setting up required.
yes,yes,yes,"I switched to the Note 4 after some years with Apple devices, and my overall impressions are really good - there's a lot of flexibility and customisation available which simply isn't possible on an iPhone. It's much more 'computer in my pocket' than the iPhone."
yes,yes,yes,I really love this phone. Very good choice
yes,yes,yes,Very Good phone and very fast. Lovely screen and goods deal.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone i love it.... :)
no,yes,no,The battery in the phone I received did not last longer than few hours of normal use. I changed the battery but it was no change: very poor battery life. Other remarks: phone is laggy and take a while to respond to touches. You don't expect such behaviour from a phone with such specs and price tag.
yes,no,yes,"No FM Radio. Really? A high end, large, and quite pricey phone like this and they can't be bothered to put in something as basic as an FM radio chip? Well, there's nothing much wrong with my Note 2, and as I fortunately discovered this silly omission on Samsung's part before I had got too far in to..."
yes,yes,yes,Dismayed by the unacceptable non-removeable battery and no memory card design of the S6 that I originally wanted I was thus diverted instead to side-grade from my trusty 2yo 16gb Galaxy S4 onwards to a 32gb Sim free no contract Galaxy Note 4.
yes,yes,yes,"Beautiful phone,a bit expensive but well worth it."
yes,yes,yes,was brought on behalf of a friend for her sons 18th and he loves it
yes,yes,yes,Love it in white and works perfectly
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. Thought it was going to be too big but it's not!
yes,yes,no,Actually bought this 2 months ago and returned it after 2 days as I couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Bought again 2 weeks ago and gave the device time to impress me and I am blown away. 'S pen is not a gimmick it's brilliant you need to learn what it can do.
yes,yes,yes,Got this on contract and in all honestly I don't see what the fuss is about. After around 4 months performance and battery life decreased by large amount. Want a phablet? Take my advice and look elsewhere.
yes,yes,yes,"Good performance, big screen very useful phone."
yes,yes,yes,I love it. I really like to use the pen. I have used the Note 3 but this is just fantastic.
yes,yes,yes,Delighted with my phone and it arrived quicker than thought
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant product
yes,yes,yes,Excellent handset
yes,yes,yes,"Best machine on the market today if you want quality, usability and one-upmanship over everything else on the market including the S6, Note 5 and anything apple, - period."
no,no,yes,"Phone has been ok. I did however find by the phone it was from Sri Lanka, India. I have my old thing back on & works as should."
yes,yes,yes,"Fabulous phablet. I will never ever live without a stylus/phablet again. This has made my life so happy and using a phone is a joy. It doesn't crash, display quality is amazing and it's speed is great too. The colors; beautiful rich, and the image is sharp enough to 'cut your eye'. I love it."
yes,yes,yes,"Really love the Note 4. Fast, beautiful screen, and a good price for the spec! Used to have the Note 2 which I also liked but this is a worthwhile upgrade."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, does everything a modern smartphone should do plus more!"
yes,yes,yes,"the actual phone , hardware, software , scredn are fantastic, beautifull vibrant bright crisp screen, in terms of use i found it not much change from my note 3, many people are not fans of toucweiz although i think its one of the best and most user friendly OS out there..."
yes,yes,yes,Just upgraded from from my Note 2. I have no complaints with the hardware - nice screen - fast processor - better s-pen - everything that you have heard is true in that regard. My one star is for the software - which is after all - a lot of what you are using in reality.
yes,yes,yes,"I have wanted one of these since they were first launched, but my other Samsung has only just given up the ghost. Stunning phone with an amazing screen and takes great quality pictures. It updated a couple of weeks ago to Marshmellow with no problems."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone. Ticks all the boxes.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, and really with a lot of features I haven't used yet but looking forward to seeing what it's capable of."
yes,yes,yes,Having used all the series of Note and still not disappointed. Just love it and will recommend to anyone because there are just brilliantly made and respond to the huge Internet and apps demand very well.
yes,yes,yes,"arrived a day later than expected, however its in one piece, no problems, love the phone"
yes,yes,yes,"You don't know how good the screen is until you try it. Great battery, fast charge is super fast for 3000+ may. Using s-pen to write this review. Multi tasking quite useful. 3 weeks of ownership and still finding useful functions every day."
yes,yes,yes,This is a truly remarkable bit of technology. I am someone who has gone through numerous phones trying to find the perfect one for me and I have never been more impressed than I am with this one.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone came fast. Unfortunately there were problems with it but the company I bought it of were more then helpful. The phone itself is powerful and after owning a note 2, this was a no brainer to buy."
yes,yes,yes,"Having owned a Galaxy Note 2 for a couple of years, I was due for an upgrade. This updated version of the handset improves on the 2 in every way (I missed the Note 3, so can't comment there)."
yes,yes,yes,"There are a number of good reviews here and I do not want to rehash what has, necessarily been said before, so here is “my 2 pence worth”. Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 excels at everything that seems to matter, it packs Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon chip, the Snapdragon 805."
yes,yes,yes,Booom..what a mobile phone..absolutely brilliant - crystal clear display..total value for money
yes,no,yes,"I was a little cautious about getting a large phone, more the practicle aspect of it fitting in jeans pockets, but I was pleasently surprised. The screen is excellent with crisp images and saturated colours with the AMOLED screen."
yes,yes,yes,Met my expectations. Love this phone! Would not change to anything else!!
yes,yes,yes,"From the start I need to admit I am a long term Samsung user and I have to admit my view will probably be a little one sided. Bought this phone as I have used the Note 3 for two years. It is a big phone and falls into that category of ""phablet""."
yes,yes,yes,"Had an original Note and then Note 3 and now this Note 4 last week. Tried the latest Windows phones in between (most recently 950XL) but for business use, particularly separating Outlook exchange emails, calendars etc. from personal stuff, its surprising but Android just does it all better."
yes,yes,yes,"I just bought this to replace my 3.5 year old note 2 and what can I say. The screen is phenomenal looking beautiful with a great resolution, it is fast and generally just a great upgrade to the note 2."
yes,no,yes,"I have been an avid note fan for a few years now. I found the note 4 had enough little changes to justify the upgrade from the note 3. Lovelly looking tablet, i mean phone ... liked the upgraded pen feature. The phone its self looks more expensive than its previous version."
yes,yes,yes,"Well my WIFE loves it; I would have preferred her buying a Xiaomi Note like mine, with dual SIM, so we can mix and match networks when travelling. The Xiaomi offers 90% of the Samsung for 25% of the cost."
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone.Specially if u wanna take notes on the spot without using pen and paper.Wide and big screen is attractive.
yes,yes,yes,"I had a Note1 and then a Note3 before the Note4 and it is by far the best one yet, the camera upgrades are worth it on its own as not only does it take the pictures faster its focusing is miles better as well."
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone when bought in 2015, still do now. Got an iPhone before this purchase still have it, but much prefer GN4."
yes,yes,yes,"Superb phone. Great battery life, SD card slot, replaceable battery - the last two being the main reasns why I bought this rather than the Note 5."
yes,yes,yes,"This is one gorgeous phone. Huge beautiful display, fast, packed with useful features and a battery that will last two days. Absolutely great. And good value for price"
yes,yes,yes,"best device i have ever used. I have previously owned a galaxy s3, s4 and s5 and this just beats them all. screen resolution, internal storage and general build quality are vastly improved. metal frame makes it feel more durable and robust."
yes,yes,yes,"Owned my note 2 for a week now. Moves from a note 2.. Awesome, simply awesome!! If you have the cash buy one. Full stop.."
yes,no,yes,I've had the same phone for the past 4 years ( Samsung nexus i9250 ) what a big difference. Very pleased. Would recommend.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product a replacement for my s4
yes,yes,yes,This is my upgrade from a iPhone 5 what a great phone this is big screen quality phone the fact you can change the battery & boost the memory with a micro sd card is a welcome change
yes,yes,yes,"I had Iphones before, and said I would never go back to an android.....this phone changed my mind! Wouldnt go back to Iphones now, if you paid me! Managed to get this one for £450, so was an absolute bargain given that the cheapest I saw was £470 on ebay!"
yes,yes,yes,Well this is one of the best phones that's in the .are today I've had mine for around say two months I've had absolutely no problems with it there loads of storage on it the performance of it is soo quick it loads things really quick never lags or anything sound quality when listening too music is...
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant phone just what i was looking for from an upgrade from galaxy s3. Bought it mainly as it had one of the best cameras on a smart phone and it has not let me down.
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone, I'm a bit of a phone addict and have tried Iphones/HTC one and lastly the S5. This trumps the lot by a considerable margin. Great camera (why better then the S5 even thogh same spec - assume better software). The screen is gorgeous in HD and the sound quality just as good."
yes,yes,yes,I've upgraded from Note 2. I must say that this Note 4 actually feels smaller and smarter in the hand. There is a metallic and premium feel to it that was lacking in the Note 2. I won't even start to write about the performance.
yes,yes,yes,"This is Samsung's latest flagship smartphone and their eighth device in their popular note line of products. Having owned the first Note smartphone and last years Note 3, I was keen to see how well this compares and it doesn't disappoint."
yes,yes,yes,"Bought it from my local o2 store in peterborough,great device, fantastic colourful screen,very fast,camera is brilliant,mp3 player sounds better and louder than previous samsung devices and most important it looks so beautiful and premium in hands especialy in white ,i believe only the s pen feature..."
yes,yes,yes,Can't go wrong with this purchase Camera awesome plus so many cool functions Battery decent. Lasts well Screen out this world. Performance great. Slight lag with Samsung skin but I changed mines using novo launcher and runs much better Call quality excellent S pen very useful at reaching those tiny...
yes,no,yes,Excellent phone overall. I had the note 2 before. I sometimes have a problem with the picture gallery recognizing the pictures from the memory card. This may be sorted by using a different memory card though hopefully. The S pen is what separates this phone from all others.
yes,yes,yes,"11/04/15 I have had galaxy note 1, 3 and now 4. There is definitely an upwards trajectory in terms of performance. The battery life was my biggest bug bear on the note 3. That really seems to be sorted on the note 4. I've been using the note 4 heavily over the last few days, since I bought it."
yes,yes,yes,"Coming from a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was probably a poor choice. To be blunt. I'd purchased this wonderful ""new and intriguing"" smartphone, in the hopes that it would, or might be better than the Note 3 I had before it. But, alas, I wasn't much impressed with it."
no,yes,no,I really tried to like this phone but I just can't get over the bad Touch wiz interface and the shoddy design. The phone is badly let down by its plasticky feel and sharp edges (the aluminium contour digs in your fingers). The faux leather plastic back is awful.
yes,yes,yes,"Great mobile, lovely big screen, good service"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, no words to describe!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,Samsung note 4 Nice and big. Android phone is new to me lot to learn how to use it properly. Thank you so much.
yes,yes,yes,"Upgraded from my Note 2 to the Note 4 and wow ! I am very impressed by the screen and the new design and feel of the device. It's build quality had improved from previous models. The performance was great, I haven't experienced any lag yet from the UI and the camera and s pen is even better !"
no,no,no,Is it work normal out of UK! For any network in word? tnx
yes,yes,yes,Phenomenal phone. Packed full of features that are especially useful for those that often take notes and edit things.
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone battery life is great, I do like the pen much faster input.Well pleased."
yes,yes,yes,"Creme de la creme of Samsung Android phones. Slick, powerful and with useful extras such as the stylus features. The camera is optically stabilised and better than the one on the Galaxy S5, which itself is superb."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best smart phone in my view, it may be large for some people but as I use this for work and play the screen size is great. In terms of processing power I have never had any lag whatsoever. If you like the bigger smartphones this could be the one for you."
yes,yes,yes,This is an Amazing phone / Tablet. Cannot put it down.
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely love this phone. It has so many smart features and the screen experience is fantastic. I had previously been an iPhone user but have been completely converted to Android and Samsung. iPhones are no longer anywhere near as competitive with the features or experience of this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Wish battery life was better.
yes,yes,yes,Flawless synchronisation with all as apps and accessories. Easy to use intuitive phablet really useful for work and leisure plus tracking fitness/health regime.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product
yes,yes,yes,"little concerned about the battery, but it works so far and i love the phone."
yes,yes,yes,For the 2g network.. signal drops intermittently. . For 3g/let works perfectly
yes,yes,yes,"Very nice phone by all standards, I only get concerned that of the 3G of RAM, I am already using 2.2GB, and I don't think the phone is fully loaded with Apps yet. Other than this, it's the best dual SIM phone yet."
yes,yes,no,I am only now up grading from a Blackberry to a 'really' smart phone (My poor Blackberry finally died) So for me big risk into uncertainty. This big risk netted a big return. Thanks
yes,no,yes,The two sim option is wonderful! Reason for 4 stars is price.....
yes,yes,yes,Thanks very good product
yes,yes,yes,"I have been living in china for nine years. If I had wanted a Chinese phone, I would have bought it at home. A few years ago, in China, I bought a real Samsung Note2 for a good price and had no trouble registering it with Samsung. I do not appreciate getting instructions in Chinese."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Love the stylus writing features. Rear camera lens got broken...not sure how.
no,no,no,Cancelled this purchase! Not sure if it will work with my GSM Straight talk sim.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this thinking that it would have two {4 g} sim card adapters, but one is international only, not 4 G....other than that its a fine phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone works great, only issue is that the 2nd sim is a 2G, not 3G, only works in Europe. Tried buying and adapter , but should have read the review first, dual sim technology is just not there yet., so I forwarded the other phone to my new Note4, works fine..."
yes,yes,yes,why buy a $2000.00 galaxy. I do not understand
yes,yes,yes,So far had no problem using this phone.
no,no,yes,Disappointing! would never buy this again. This phone was conceive to do almost anything but it isn't a computer in the sense we expect them to be. I am still wondering what this phone can really do well ...
yes,yes,yes,It's the best phone I ever had.
yes,yes,yes,love the phone but due to our being an international phone it does not have 4g speed. Hence the reason for the 4 stars.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, meets my expectations. Great camera, music, Bluetooth works perfect - though initially had challenge with this where I was not able to talk/hear during conversations in the car, but it was easily resolved by a technician. Email is a bit slow, sometimes."
no,no,yes,"It says 16gb internal, isn't this 32gb internal storage?.."
yes,yes,yes,Ordered phone received within 2 days of order. Brand new and box sealed!! Just had to change language at start up from Italian to English and works perfectly well on EE. Plug/lead works in UK it is a 2 pin but you just need to pull the 3rd prong out on it for it to work in UK ...
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy 4 - the Innovative Smartphone Pros:- The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 comes with the vastly improved and stylish S-pen, that acts like a mouse for your phone.- It has a sharp and vibrant screen, equipped with the super AMOLED capacitive touch screen with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels."
yes,no,yes,Can you use this on Straight Talk?
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone!! I find new uses on it. I am surprised that I particularly like the way it links with my Gear Fit watch. I wasn't particularly interested in how many steps I take a day or what my heart rate is but I find that, since it's being tracked, it gives me an incentive to be more..."
yes,yes,yes,Totally impressed with the purchase. Awesome customer care also.
no,no,yes,This phone support 4g LTE network in india
yes,yes,yes,"Don't buy Samsung Smart Phone please like, comment, share on all Samsung Mobile complaints [...] please like, comment, share do it and share as much as possible Likes those pages: [...] [...] [..."
yes,yes,yes,Very expensive for such a device from Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,I have bought the same cell and has been using it fa quite some time. I am very with it. hat's of to samsung fa coming up with such an excellent cell. and tht to in dual sim
yes,yes,yes,I Love this phone but price in Amzon is very high. Currently it shoud be around 32K
yes,yes,yes,nice mobile. imported so does sim 2 suppport 3g
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is awesome, trouble is I'm in Canada and can't get updates only on AT&T's network in the states."
yes,no,yes,"Though it can not be updated off AT&T wireless network, it is still enough to use Android 4.4.4 installed from factory."
no,no,no,"Arrived at time, but received damaged not working phone."
no,no,no,Fingerprint sensor was not working out of the box. I had to return it due to being defective.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. Unlocked phone works great with straight talk wireless. No trouble connecting and no different than att phone that I had before but lost
no,yes,no,Locked boot loader. Impossible to root. Why buy a crippled phone? Stay away!
no,yes,no,"The phone camein an opened box.The plastic was taken off of the back cover. It clearly wasn't BRAND NEW in the box untouched by human hands, but it was new enough. It works properly & is working with att."
no,yes,yes,Received phone as it is advertised. Working fine. Nothing to complain
yes,yes,yes,If I had a six star it would be light up thanks. I got way more than I expected
yes,yes,yes,I was worried when I first opened the box because it was a already open and the box was a little rough looking. But the phone was brand new! Looked amazing! I would definitely buy knew! I bought this from BMI Group.
no,no,no,"Not sure what to say but this was my 1st unlocked phone. I dont know why the At&t branded unlocked phone is $200+ cheaper than the locked phone seeing that unlocked phones are normally higher valued for their ""unlockness"". Regardless, from the gate I had concerns about the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung made major changes to it's interface from the Note 3 and not good ones. It is so much different from the last phone that I'm having a hard time using it. Say bye, bye to the edit button. The phones a pain in the, you know what, to even turn on. Quite the delay there."
yes,no,no,"Very good camera, large print for poor eyesight, does everything except have dinner with me. This is a keeper! So much info for an old-timer I printed out the manual."
yes,yes,yes,Never ordered this items
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone. It is a little bigger than the average phone, but that allows the keys on the virtual keyboard to be spaced a little further apart and to put the letters and numbers on the screen together. I can't tell you how much easier to use that is. I have really come to love the pen."
no,yes,no,Some of my features don't work and my phone be freezing on me and it takes a few min for the call to go threw not happy at all with the phone can I get another one and do I have a warranty on the phone
no,no,no,Had issues out of the6box. Samsung knows of problems but sells defective devices and will repair if you send it back to them. HAVE A REPLACEMENT ON HAND.
yes,yes,yes,Great device. It is on the large size but will fit in my jeans pocket with no problem. I was using an S4 but this phone does so much more. Buy this phone.
yes,yes,yes,The phone works fine WITH the exception of the headphone outlet! Has a shortage and that was a big reason I didn't like my old phone!!
yes,yes,yes,I love it. Works perfectly on Straight Talk. Had to figure out how to get mms receiving to work. No other problems with the phone.
yes,yes,yes,Had this phone for about 2 weeks now and im loving it. So far great product
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone. Super fast. Love the s pen. Great battery life. previous phone were s2, s4, nexus 5. This is by far the best. Great camera as well. Phone is large though. It will fit in back pocket but not front. A little weighty too."
no,yes,no,"it is good and fast payment, but it is not new at all! box is opened and battery is bumping around the box when I opened it. Most importantly, the phone have a really bad service receive, always broke off and out of service, I never had that before."
yes,yes,yes,"I have always owned iPhones and this is my first Samsung Galaxy phone. Although Apple wins when it comes to practicality and ease of use, I have no regrets making the switch. Love the sharp screen, camera, and best of all, the stylus. Highly recommended."
yes,yes,yes,Great Android phone with fantastic battery life but even more awesome fast charging. Truly great fast charging. The S Pen is incredible. I am a stylus type individual and the handwriting recognition is superb. Great product and worth the purchase even though my daily driver is the iPhone 6 plus.
yes,yes,yes,Brought it during lighting deal... great price and its UNLOCKED
yes,yes,yes,"After doing a lot of research looking for an unlocked phone because I didn't want to be locked into a contract for 2 years, this was a great deal for a high end phablet and arrived as promised. Now using it with low cost Cricket service and have had no issues at all."
yes,yes,yes,A little slow compared to newer phones but the screen is great.
no,no,no,I am extremely upset with this phone. I waited anxiously for the phone to give to a relative of mine and it wouldn't even turn on when I tried to charge it. Never turned on and the pen didn't even fit the phone. I am so disappointed.
no,no,yes,I have order this phone. It's works but as far as another simple card from another coverage provider is strainious work. If you are going with att&t yea. But anything outside of that you got your work cut out for you
yes,yes,yes,"PROs: The display is top quality. The new screens are hardly better. Fantastic. Also, the screen size is fantastic for watching movies/documentaries/lectures/etc. It's not too big and fits in my pocket fine. Wouldn't mind it being even bigger."
yes,yes,yes,I Love the phone but one star because the mail man left it in front of the house which was poor communication
yes,yes,yes,"Mine works great, no problem"
yes,yes,yes,"Compatible with T-mobile. Can text and talk. Data usage is fine as well. Just can't update system since default is AT&T, and there's no way to change that."
yes,yes,yes,Horrible battery life. But everything else works fine
no,yes,yes,wrong item not unlocked as advertised
no,yes,no,"Useless brick. This ""device"" will drain your battery if you attempt to take photos, videos, or use apps. Even if you have 50% on that battery, it will go to zero in a snap and it often shuts down at the most inconvenient times."
yes,yes,yes,Next time place do the writing things for your customers
yes,yes,yes,"I swear this phone fell off the back of an AT&T delivery truck. It has AT&T icon and jingle, loaded with AT&T apps. No earbuds either"
yes,yes,yes,Phone works great
no,yes,yes,"Microphone half works, camera takes 30 seconds to focus, bluetooth sometimes works, and screen extremely sensitive... Hate it"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone even when compared to what's out today!
no,yes,no,The phone is defective it's come with a faulty screen that wont displaying anything charger not working.
yes,yes,yes,Works good. Only disadvantage is Bluetooth sender/receiver is too weak and works stable with devices on distance not longer than 7 feet (2 meters) away
no,yes,no,"My new Note 4 started randomly shutting off and rebooting after 5 months; a known issue. It also took several minutes to start up, sometimes either taking up to 15 minutes, or getting stuck in boot loops. Even after updates and full resets (yes, I know how to do it correctly), the issue persisted."
no,yes,no,I need to send it back for replacement
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with the phones and we received them within 2 days of purchase. Awesome
yes,yes,yes,"Battery life not long enough, had to buy an extended battery. The company I purchased it from is an excellent company!!!"

yes,yes,yes,"Thanks for the phone, the price was awesome I've had it for a couple of months now, still works great, thanks again"
yes,yes,yes,"Got new, unused. its great, even after all these years, the last REAL Galaxy Note from Samsung. All later models are lame halfbaked iphone wannabees."
no,yes,no,"I bought this phone however when I got it the power button doesn't work, neither was the volume buttons and the phone wudnt come on. When i took it took it to the dealer they inspected the phone infront of me and told me i had received a clone.I had to send the item back. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love it! I had another Samsung Galaxy and with the Smart Switch app, I got all my info from the old phone to the new one effortlessly. It's an AT&T phone, but works great on my Straight Talk plan. I like the size and the increased GB. It came when it was supposed to."

Second get a good battery saver app to save battery, screen uses a lot of the battery if you keep at full brightness, also keeps apps from running in..."
no,yes,no,The rear camera is said to be 16 mp and front about 3.7 mp but I dont think that the camera is of that much quality. I feel it is much lower than the said megapixels. Even the autofocus is not working properly. It takes minutes to foucs.

yes,yes,yes,"Love, love this phone. I have no problem with it except it is an AT&T phone. I disable all the AT&T apps so that they won't interfere with my daily usage and it's all good thereon. I even used the phone outside of the US. Highly recommended."
yes,yes,yes,"I wanted an unlocked phone in a low price range and I ended up getting a Galaxy Note 4. I had previously used Note 2 and 3, so I was familiar of what I would get. I also know this was a used phone under the 'used-very good' category."

no,no,no,"The phone itself is very good, however, the battery is very poor. Its juice lasts less than 6 hours under below average use on WiFi and if with 4G connection, it lasts less than 3 hours... This is very limiting, I need to get a new battery."

no,no,no,Bad Battery. Never charges more than 80 % . Slow degradation in past 3 weeks. AT&T Blotware filled. Lots of inoperable applications from AT&T. called supplier with battery issue. Supplier promised free replacement next day. NEVER RECEIVED REPLACEMENT. Frustration with product and seller.
yes,yes,yes,"Best smartphone I've ever had. I love the S pen, the fact that I can pop in a charged battery whenever I like instead of being tied to a charger or external battery and it has memory expansion. So much better than Apple."
yes,no,yes,So far i like this phone havn't had any issues with it to date. It came with a cheap screen protector on it which i thought was a pretty cool touch. My big problem is that the phone is a unlocked AT&T phone which the description did not mention.

yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. It is fast and powerful. The camera is great. The stylus is fantastic. The fingerprint reader is a big step up from a passcode, but still needs to be improved. The screen is gorgeous! Android versus iOS Bottom line, geeks should choose Android."

yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone takes beautiful pictures nice screen size
yes,no,yes,Especially like the s-pen.

yes,yes,yes,"I bought the note 4 few months ago. It is very good looking phone and it has tons of features (like all samsung and android phones). But honestly, other than the faster processor, and the pen, it is not much different than my old s4. The screen was a bit big for my taste."

yes,yes,yes,your sarvic very good
no,yes,yes,"WORTHLESS! SupremeDeals is a supreme ripoff. Spent $400 on this phone a year ago and it's completely bricked in the last 2 days. No updates, no changes, it just decided to destabilize and stop responding. Zero help from them. None. Just a ""there's nothing we can do."" Nope."
yes,no,yes,Good unlocked phone

no,yes,no,This is a bad product. I am regretting getting it. The battery power is so poor; it shuts off when used in the cold. It is highly unreliable as a phone. I have bben lost twice because it shut off while using the GPS. I would not advise anyone to get this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Just simply amazing.!
yes,yes,yes,Great for one year.
yes,yes,yes,"This product was as expected. I had to do a little research to figure out how to get my mobile data to work because I'm using a straight talk Sim, but it wasn't hard took about 30 minutes of research and changing a few settings. Defiantly worth the price."
yes,yes,yes,"Why pay more? Perfect phone for today, early 2017."
yes,yes,yes,Not as advertise.
no,no,no,"This phone hasn't worked right since the day I bought it. After 3 months, it stopped working. I bought insurance, but the insurance company says that I have to go through Samsung, since it's still under manufacturer's warranty."

yes,yes,yes,Met my expectations
yes,yes,yes,Works. I love the S Pen. Great product.
no,yes,yes,"Was great for about six months until the phone's emmc crashed and now boots up 1/10 times. Be careful when selecting your phones. I'm a little more than frustrated, as now I'll be looking to purchase my third phone in a year and a half due to hardware issues."
no,no,no,Can i turn off the camera shutter ? & has anyone else had trouble using apps ? Do they all respond correctly?
no,yes,yes,"At the beginning I was so excited for this phone, but after a while I realized that because it belongs to at&t you can not update the phone to the newest OS. Yes it's unlocked, but it has all the att bs software. Beware of this model, when the battery is low like 15% it turns off."

no,no,no,the charger just stopped working
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, Even though I bought it in 2016, this phone still has a lot of fire power and Blows most other phones out of the water... especially with todays prices. Pros: The screen is pure love, its one of the most gorgeous displays on a phone you'll see, very detailed and the colors pop."

no,no,no,"Had this phone a little over 1 month and the screen keeps going blank . I have to take out the battery and cool it in front of a fan for the screen to come back on. If that isn't bad enough the volume key just went out as well. I can't believe I just spent over 300$$ on a ""new phone."
yes,yes,yes,My cousin saw Christmas early when she got this. It's not the latest but it's among the best.
yes,yes,yes,"Didn't get any earphones, but it's totally beautiful.I love everything about it."
yes,no,yes,"I have used my Samsung Galaxy Note 1 for the longest time (almost 4 years) and was very pleased with it. Naturally, when it came to upgrade my phone, I chose Samsung Note 4. I've been using it for more than a year now and it has never failed me. The camera is superb and clear."
no,yes,no,This phone was expensive and felt and looked cheap. I had to return it. It was not worth what they wanted for it.
no,yes,no,I bought this phine on august and battery is already dying and it keeps closing pages and turning on and off
yes,yes,yes,This phone loses charge too fast. I only get a max charge of 2 hours with moderate use and 4 hours with no use. I have a feeling that this phone is not new. Also it did not have everything that comes with a new note 4 like ear plugs and extra tips for the s pen. All I got was a charger with it.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! This phone from 2014 has pretty much everything the iPhone 7 Plus released in 2016 finally has. Excellent camera with 4K video. Doesn't need a case because the back of the phone has a material that is easy to grip.

yes,yes,yes,"I ordered this phone from Wireless Deals. It arrived early in undamaged condition. Wireless Deals packed the phone very securely. It came with a charger, S pen, headphones and quick start guide. This was my first time ordering from them, and I'm happy."
yes,yes,yes,I like the product. Great service. Thanks
no,yes,no,I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. I have a samsung note 4 from Verizon. This phone sucks! The worst phone ever! Battery life is terrible. Shuts down my phone so randomly.
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone. It does everything I wanted and More. It's a great size, great speed. I'm glad I did my research. If you have trouble with the battery, t uh rn the location setting to GPS only. Then it lasts all day. I live in the woods, and it can still find me. ."
yes,yes,yes,Only thing I would say is more detail in The description would be nice so you can tell if your getting att phones or verizon so you know what to get
no,no,no,The home button don't work...... very disappointed
yes,no,no,"Not at all. was very discourage and had to return the product. The back cover of the phone is very poor quality. One corner was brocke. I love samsung, but this product didn't meet the qualities of samsung. Need to buy another samsung and I hope its gonna be good."
yes,yes,yes,"Brand new, super clear screen, great camera, with just a little bit of traces on the edge but all I needed was a phone cover. I LOVE MY NOTE 4!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,some dent signs on the back cover. I was thinking that is not brand new-restocked.
yes,yes,yes,Good phone thank you.
no,yes,yes,The phone is nice. The only problem is that it came with a dead battery. You would think after spending that kind of money the battery would be good.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. I always stick with Samsung products and this phone is great.
no,no,no,"This phone just stopped working after two (2) months. It is not turning on. Nada, zit, dead to the world!"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is good, it has huge capacity, comes with most of the important apps, camera is good, but not as good as galaxy S7! I love it so much"
no,no,no,its supplied likes new with slow and wake time is much more than usual. even worst than note-1.
no,yes,no,very disappointed with this phone it is not taking any charge
no,yes,no,Do not buy this phone. I just got this phone yesterday and the phone takes hours.... to charge and will not hold a charge. The batter lasted 1 hour on 100%. Now the phone is turning off and on by itself. All I hope now is I can get it on long enough to restore it.
no,yes,yes,The camera was cracked on the bk of the phone
yes,yes,yes,The phone is good but my charger cord disintegrated in the 2nd week after I had bought the phone. I had to borrow a charger cord. I didn't expect that for a new phone. Not pleased
yes,yes,yes,Loving my phone so far. All is well
yes,yes,yes,"Phone seems to be in good shape- looked brand new. However, I am having to purchase a new battery for it as the one that came in it won't hold a charge. I had no issues when changing out the SIM card from the old phone."
no,yes,no,"This phone is not good, camera don't work properly , battery don't charge more than 77% please, please don't buy this kind of phones"
no,no,no,I just bought this product and had it delivered yesterday. The battery will not charge above 84% and there is no way to return it. DO NOT BUY!!!!
no,no,no,I would not buy this phone! After a while it stopped working!!! Took it to 3 cell phone repair places where they found nothing wrong with it. Waste of money!
no,yes,yes,There is battery problems
yes,no,no,"did not last a week and seller wouldnt refund, wish it had a zero stars thats what i would rate it..."
yes,yes,yes,Good Product..but I wish the charger was an original one..
no,yes,yes,"The phone's battery would not charge past 70% . attempted to recalibrate the battery usage and it did not change. Plus, selecting the initialization option to save contacts and photos on cloud caused never ending error messages on text messaging app."
yes,yes,yes,I waited to give my review. I have had the device for alittle over 6 months now. No issues. My Note 4 works as good as the day I purchased it. Still using it to this day at home and work.
yes,yes,yes,I received this phone brand new! I love this phone! Thank you for the perfect transaction. I really love it. Absolutely nothing wrong with this phone! Came unlocked and got it turned on 3 hours after receiving it. Thank you so much!
yes,yes,yes,very happy with note 4 everything they said it was and more
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone! Extremely pleased.
yes,yes,yes,"Last Samsung that has replaceable battery and external microSD. Best smartphone I've ever had. Amazing light adaptation in the sun. I'm not buying Note 5, 7, or any other high end smartphones until someone comes with a model that again has removable battery, microSD card, and possibly an FM radio."
yes,yes,yes,"GREAT PHONE, LARGE SCREEN EASY TO READY AND WRITE"
yes,yes,yes,Such versatility!!!! Just love the large screen. I had to decide on Android or iPhone when Palm/WebOS got screwed over by HP & never did find the iPhone's intuitive or flexible. I can swap out my extra battery & continue to use the pen as I did on the old Palm devices.
yes,yes,yes,I researched the heck out of this to make sure I was the one I wanted for Cricket. Really loving it. This model (N910 'A') is specifically for AT&T. Since they own Cricket it easily changed with just a sim card.
no,no,no,"They delivered the package one day ahead. That''s something good. However, what''s bad is the screen resolution and the 16MP camera and other specifications indicated for camera and screen is not true."
no,yes,no,"At first gave this product 5 stars, after a few days of use the battery is defected or old, this appears to be a recurrent problem with this cell phone"
yes,yes,yes,Everything looks great on the phone the only issue I had was on the home screen in the lock mode. It always had the tennis shoes steps program and I wasn't even using that app. Other than that was is a good phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this. I don't use it as a phone and have no cell service, but it's a great tablet/phone. The stylus works very well and I have this for a month and have had no problems with it. :)"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is excellent! A warning to people using MetroPCS, make sure you call them in advance, find the IME located under the battery of the phone, and have them switch over the device or you'll receive the error ""Phone not allowed MM#6"". They lock their Sim cards to their devices to prevent theft."
no,yes,yes,Phone works wonderfully but I wish it was clearly stated that the home button had been replaced (its a bit tough to use) and that the S Pen was not original. I keep getting an error - spen detached.
yes,yes,yes,It's Great . I just don't like how it only charges to about 80-99% .. but other than that .. Its A Good Phone .. Highly Recommended !
yes,yes,yes,Product great... had a small problem with the charger cord but got resolved quickly... Nice phone Love it...
yes,yes,yes,"This phone took almost 2 weeks to be delivered. After waiting that long needless to say I was pumped to finally get it. I bought it ""new"". The phone came in a box with the charger that was still in the wrapper, so I'm assuming it was new."
yes,yes,yes,"Probably the best phone I've ever had. It was a roaring beast in 2014, and still is to this day. The Note 5 was only designed well by the exterior but was pretty much a disaster on all other sides and has less features than the Note 4."
no,yes,no,this phone gives me an head ache it just turn off when it wants to i just got the phone not even an year now and am think about a get a new phone which will be an iphone am so sick off this one
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I've ever had. Previous phones that I've had had very little storage space and I ran out of memory rather quickly. Too quick for me. I bought this phone because it is a bigger screen and has a lot more memory than others.
no,no,no,Came with big scuff when was told just some scratches. Very disappointed.
no,no,yes,"only the self camera works, it doesn't work on the reverse at all"
yes,yes,yes,Badass phone. Not much to say phone speaks for it self
no,yes,no,Couldn't get the phone to stay on for longer than 3 seconds so I couldn't get thru the setup. Phone just kept turning off. I don't mean hibernating because I couldn't wake it up. It just shut done so many times that I finally gave up...packaged it up and back it goes tomorrow.
yes,yes,yes,There is no Arabic language
yes,yes,yes,"It's amazing,I like the Samsung galaxy note 4,100% original."
yes,yes,yes,"Works great, my hubby now wants this phone instead of an iPhone"
yes,yes,yes,Using it for this review. I actually don't think I have been without it since it arrived. Samsung has always been quality and the Note 4 is no exception. Great sound and I can even get reception in the hospital...okay perhaps that's the carrier.
yes,yes,yes,"I've dropped it a couple of times since I bought it, but it has been working great so far, no problems. I have t-mobile and I don't plan on getting another phone until something really goes wrong with this one."
no,yes,yes,This is an ATT phone with a lot of bloat wear not clearly stated I have disabled a lot of the software since it is not removable what a shame
yes,no,yes,Did not allow you to upgrade to Android L 5.1 decent phone
yes,yes,yes,This was a birthday gift. I knew what was wanted and the features and when I found the item I talked with the birthday person describing and reading to them the details and description. It was what was needed and wanted.
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love this phone, it's exactly as described by seller.... it's a great buy"
yes,yes,yes,"This is a beautiful pearly white android Samsung Galaxy Note 4 phone, the best I've ever owned! Its so powerful. I think it has only shut down 3 or 4 times in 6 months with no problems once I turn it back on. It does not freeze. It doesn't overheat and has a nice long battery life."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone!!!! Love it a lot!
yes,yes,yes,"An Excellent product, i liked its camera resolution, and S Pen experience."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone so much! I waited a week or so to write a review to see if any problems would come up. Nothing has came up wrong with it at all. I was scared of buying such an expensive phone not knowing it would work right but it was no mistake at all, everything came as described."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone!!! I love it.
yes,yes,yes,"Great device, brand new as described!"
yes,yes,yes,Better condition than the description even said!
yes,yes,yes,like the camera feature and photos taken w/ the phooe are clear and nice
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone!
yes,yes,yes,Is the BEST phone I have EVER had! Yes! That Great!
no,yes,yes,"Earpiece speaker died after receiving. Totally died after using 32 days. However, shipping is fast and response takes one day."
no,yes,yes,"The battery is bad!!!! It goes from 50% to 0% in a few minutes with light usage and it charges slowly even with the fast charger. Basically the battery power fluctuates a lot and this is annoying, definitely not what i expect from a new phone. But i really love this phone"
no,no,no,I cannot make or receive calls inside my apartment... I have to go outside to make calls.
yes,yes,yes,"My original Note 4 died in less than 2yrs. I ordered up this Note 4 and it works even better than the original. It finds the Satellite on Google Maps where my old Note 4 had problems. At my house, I do notice the new Note 4 to be poorer at connecting to my carrier T-Mobile."
no,yes,yes,"I bought this phone for my wife a little over a month ago. The phone will charge to 100 percent but will just shut off at 40 percent or 14 percent, as well at other random percentages. The charging cord was very cheap and had a short in it once we received the phone."
no,no,no,No it didnt because phone turns off other wise so spent 350.00 for nothi g it doesnt work.
no,no,no,"Had I known that after a month and half my phone home button would not have worked, I would have never purchased this phone. Now I have to pay 200 bucks to fix it. Further the phone gets very hot and just shuts off. This is really absurd. This phone was sold to me as knew."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the beat phone I've ever used. Of course my previous phone was an LG Optimus Elite so it's a substantial upgrade. The phone does EVERYTHING it advertises. The stylus features are great to take quick notes, write down a phone number and it automatically can add it to your contacts."
yes,yes,yes,Got this as a Christmas present and have loved it from day one. It was delivered earlier than stated. All I did was pop my sim card in and everything loaded up
no,no,yes,MAKE SURE YOU ORDER THE CORRECT VERSION FOR YOUR REGION. I was all set to order the wrong version when I realized the only difference is the letter at the end of the model number.
yes,no,yes,It did reached some of my aspectation
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910a,it's a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,As advertised. Worked with no problems out of the box.

yes,yes,yes,"Love it, it's everything I wanted. data wouldn't work with cricket, so I had to switch to at&t. But I prefer at&t so it's fine."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this to replace my wife's prepaid at&t phone, all she had to do was switch the sim card. Great phone, amazing camera."
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I've ever had. the main reason I purchased this phone was to work with the Samsung Gear VR and they both work Great
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I highly recommend getting the T Mobile version of this phone instead of the AT&T version as it has a much better processor
yes,yes,yes,"Anyone considering geting one should definitely do it. It's really well designed, feels very nice in the hand and the battery easily lasts the entire day. At first it felt rather big, but once I got used to it I find other phones too small."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! Pretty much brand new!
no,no,no,"This doesn't work with at@t unless you have a current share internet program. It's not an international phone and doubt it's unlocked seeing it came in att box sealed but damaged , also there is no root available at this time for SM-N910A , I would fix but not fixable"
yes,yes,yes,by far the best phone I have every had.....love the screen....the pen....love it all. p.s I have own every phone ever made it seems over the years....great phone.
no,no,no,I received my phone even earlier than the estimate shipping date. Was very excited!
yes,no,yes,Got it on a lightning deal. Phone was unlocked and worked great on the tmobile network
yes,yes,yes,It's just like a new Note 4. Everthing came with it except Samsung earphones which was fine. The Note 4 works great.
yes,yes,yes,"I believe the best phone on the market currently there is nothing to say about it, all that speed all the performances the one that I received is not made in China but it is originally made in Korea which I dont have much to say about but perfect phone."
yes,yes,yes,"It's awesome, nice style, look cool, super screen color, super picture taking, super fast for download or reading and better than Iphone 6 plus in many area."
yes,yes,yes,"Great device. Get this variant of the Note 4 if you want it on U.S. GSM carriers such as Straight Talk, AT&T, T-Mobile, etc. LTE is available with this variant as well. The charger that comes with the device is not for the U.S., but seller did include adapter."
yes,yes,yes,Shipped very well as expected.
yes,yes,yes,I received it in good condition. I was surprised that even though the screen is large the phone does not feel large. It is functioning to expectation . Exelent camera and good phone speed.
yes,yes,yes,L o ve everything about it except voice sending quality on phone.
yes,yes,yes,Love it. Just wish they came with manual!

yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a beast with its super octa-core. I absolutely loved this phone for the short time I got to play with it before it decided to take a dump on me and break my heart. First off yes this phone is all that and a bag of chips, sleek, fast and did I mention a beast???"
yes,yes,yes,"It has been a month since I am using it. Got no problems. It really is the best smartphone available in the market right now. Good battery life, awesome camera and the features added by the s pen makes it worth it's price"
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone
no,no,no,Does it work with Verizon?
yes,yes,yes,"So far I'm loving my new Samsung Galaxy note 4, the only thing missing is a user book so I could figured out certain features. Otherwise, it's an excellent phone-tablet one's can possess. I bought the unlocked one and is working fine with metro."
yes,yes,yes,"can I use this cellphone with cricket wireless in florida? when I put in my sim card,does this phone will be working good? thanks."
no,yes,yes,I was dissapointed because I couldn't get it turned on with any company I preferred had to settle for less with my service and I spent so much for the phone not a good deal
yes,yes,yes,Seem perfect. But I have to use it no know.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, great everything!!!!"
no,yes,no,"Hi, I ordered a Samsung Note-4 (SM-910C) but the package says it is SM-N9100. Returning the item."
yes,yes,yes,Not up to the mark for the price. I bought it for 762 three months back. Positive: 1) Battery is good. Charging for once in couple of days is enough. 2) As usual display and clarity is very good. 3) Touch screen sensitive is very good. Negative: 1) Mobile gets restarted automatically.

I bought the phone in the US and then moved to Cambodia, without ever using a US simcard in the phone (as I had intended to start using the phone..."
yes,yes,yes,Great genuine product.
yes,yes,yes,"Just all I expected from it really, big and bald! Easy to use, perfect for my father who is 78 and spends his time online and chatting to friends on whattsapp"
no,yes,yes,this phone does not memorize wifi password. I try to solve this by going to three seperate stores in three different coutries. no solutions to fix flaw. you have to manually input wifi password all the time. super hassle. biggest default of this phone Design.
no,yes,yes,"The international version of the phone, I changed two phone cards, because the network can not"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is for the photo enthusiast. Not because of the camera but because of the screen brightness, size, and clarity. Combine this with PicSay Pro and the stylus and you have a very powerful photo editing phone. Gaming on this phone is just as rewarding."
yes,yes,yes,"Now it is nice AND good product in Turkey. it's speed is perfect. In the future, don't know.Thank you.' I can advice it."

yes,yes,yes,Worked great but S Pen would not pick up

yes,yes,yes,Good.Came as described!
no,no,no,I wish o could give 0 stars. I've been contacting them like crazy for about 2 months now via phone they never get back to me I've emailed them never gotten back to me. This phone does not work.
yes,yes,yes,This is an awesome device.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I use it on MetroPCS and works flawlessly. I did buy the same model twice(910c) and the they noth came with different weird chargers from a different cointry. One charger did come with an American adapter.
yes,yes,yes,Save your money and buy this phone kids. Everything about it is fantastic and it is by far the best phone I have ever owned. This particular unlocked phone is 4G capable and can be used with T-Mobile. I originally ordered the other model but read it wasn't 4G compatible.
yes,yes,yes,Meets my expectation. Arrived quite on time. Impressed overall.
yes,yes,yes,Works perfect. Nice phone with octa core processor. But don't know why but the update to Lollipop 5.1 do not happen. I have tried through Kies and OTA but it doesn't detect any new update and still in KitKat 4.4....and Lollipop for Note 4 N910C has been releaed. I'm user from USA.
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love this phone! It works with StraightTalk without any problems at all. It has been a pleasure to learn something new about this phone/tablet (Fablet). I do end up carrying it in my hands a lot because of it's size. So if your looking for something compact, this certainly is not it."
yes,yes,yes,"I have used it for a week now, and must say that the phone works as with any new phones. This is an internationally version, specifically Asian/China version so the power plug won't fit in the US outlets, but an adapter is provided with the phone."
yes,yes,yes,It's not the real thing.
yes,no,yes,The phone turned out to be excellent but the purchasing experience was more difficult than expected as the phone came programmed in such an obscure Eastern European language that it was a challenge to set it to English.
yes,yes,yes,"excellent phone, delivery in time, i recommend!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"Work fine , no problems so far"
no,yes,yes,Hi are you think I can use t mobile end I no have problems for the

yes,yes,yes,"Samsung rules love the phone, the phone is great in 2 days after ordering up and running. The phone came in sealed Samsung box. No problems quick charge and put in my CC sim and was on the GSM provider system. The provider couldn't be better. Safe and sound don't be scared away."

yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It works perfectly on AT&T. It is inarguably the best phone out today.
yes,yes,yes,"This Note 4 works okay with Cricket Wireless, but only includes three of the five band that Cricket uses. Also, Cricket said that it was an European phone instead of a USA phone and that was why it didn't contain all of the five frequency bands used by Cricket."
yes,yes,yes,Coool product .. perfect service
no,no,no,This phone worked for two months and then locked up. I spoke with my carrier and they were unable to help me. I took it to a Samsung repair store and they tried to reload the operating system but were unable to.
yes,yes,yes,Husband loves it
no,yes,yes,Bluetooth will not connect to my wireless earphones. It also not as receptive as my old Note 2 to my T mobile network. Shows only 1 bar or less where my note 2 used to show 4. I hve never seen a 4 bar reception on this phone.
yes,no,yes,Really good unlocked Note 4. I use mine on Straight Talk and it works flawlessly.
yes,yes,yes,"DELIVERY QUICKER THAN EXPECTED, GREAT PHONE, AWESOME SCREEN AND PICS AND SUPERB PERFOMANCE."
yes,yes,yes,"Well, it's an android phone. Works well but don't get 5-stars because Samsung custom modifications doesn't work very well (unlock screen sometimes don't unlock the phone, there is no additional user accounts options and takes a lot of time for new android releases to come by)."
no,no,no,"So the device came with touch screen issues from day 1: The pen would still work but the device became completely unresponsive to finger touch. I removed the battery and rebooted the device, this is when it started working back again..."

yes,yes,yes,Works excellently! It can use 4G LTE speeds. I use T-mobiles network with Ultra Mobile and it works very well in T-mobile network areas. You have to get use to it being big if you had a smaller phone like the iphone 5S like I did.

yes,yes,yes,Takes the best pictures and very handy for meetings and persons on the go who needs information fast
yes,yes,yes,"My first Galaxy note, and I love it, especially the size. As I get older, I find that I need more reading space and this gets the job done. I was worried that it would be too big for my hand but I found it is slightly bigger than the Galaxy S4 and that was what I was looking for."
no,yes,no,..i had to return immediately...since it cannot update software firmware....its not the original...
no,no,no,"I got my phone on sep. 20th and realized that my wifi and camera focus is not working properly. So I wrote an email on oct. 4th telling them about the issue. At the time, they asked me if I tried hard reset and as I replied I did, they asked me if I wanted a phone swap. I said yes."

yes,yes,yes,I would highly recommend this phone it's fantastic.
yes,yes,yes,"I only give four stars because although the phone is freaking awesome, I feel there should have been a little more disclosure on just how much tinkering you will have to do to get this thing working right in the US."
no,yes,yes,"At 10 days the s pen fails ... when I extract from the cell and starts the air command, the phone restarts without option."
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone...works wll in Trinidad and Tobago, on TSTT network and enjoys both voice and data service wit this model."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone but be careful purchasing from BREED, they list it as brand new but phone arrives unsealed with marks showing it was an ex display."
yes,yes,yes,"Arrived brand new and so far is working well, I would have given it 5 stars BUT - the phone I received is in fact the N910T and not the N910C - and while it does work in the Caribbean - it does not have the option to toggle the mobile data on and off which I have read is model specific, so far..."

yes,no,yes,"The BEST Note Samsung has ever made as of January 2016 !!! I bought two units for myself and wife about 9 months ago and they both work flawlessly. Don't buy the NOTE 5 as it is a DOWNGRADE from the Note 4, and the current price, it is a steal..."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone arrived in box, new and working perfectly, and I have very much enjoyed using this phone-- and will continue to. I still consider the Note 4 to be one of the best, if not the best, phones on the market and it runs fast and smooth."
yes,yes,yes,"Expectations...Yes!...very, very..."
yes,yes,yes,Got exactly what I paid for he phone is brand new
no,no,no,"I have a lot of issues with the phone blocking out on me like right after when I can return the phone, but I'm stuck with it and a lot of my apps load very slow."

yes,no,yes,My experience so far is really good.
yes,yes,yes,"Satisfied customer! After purchasing from a different seller of the same phone, at last I got a phone that is true as it is advertised. The phone is really new!"
yes,yes,yes,I've had a cracked S3 ever since my new employee decided to walk through a GM plant while on his cellphone. Spun around so fast the S3 never saw it coming. Short of this story is that i've waited a LONG time to choose my new phone.
yes,yes,yes,Very good! Am very satisfied with the product.
no,yes,no,I like the phone okay but I'm very disappointed with the screen display. It has a very noticeable purple hue in the top half of screen. I only really see it if it has a white background. I didn't notice it when I first got the phone.
yes,yes,yes,I love my note 4 I am so inlove with it

yes,yes,yes,It works great thank you
yes,yes,yes,"It is an outstanding phone. The phone is amazing, better than any other around now."
yes,yes,yes,Great deal and works great!
yes,yes,yes,Works great. Had a note 4 but it was the h model and the c model was the one with lte so pretty much the same except now i can utilize lte on my service. I would recomend note 4 still today because it has a removable battery and a micro sd card slot and a head phone jack.
no,no,no,"Good morning I bought this phone from you in march and got it in April 3016 and I am unable to use it as it keeps buring my fingers, my ears and burning me through my clothes when I have it in my pocket. I put it into my bag and it melts my make up and chocolate."
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone, like the jacked up version of the regular note 4, octacore processor, ect note 4 on steroids"
no,no,yes,"I did recieved a Note 4 N910V instead of N910C. Still work in my country, not problem yet. But it could be a problem. Also it had I picture in the gallery memory of a kind of ""cellphone repair shop""??? Suppose to be NEW. All clear right? Even though seams to work well."
no,yes,yes,Good working.but can't getting repair at opicial Samsung USA services center.
yes,yes,yes,"It was advertised that the phone is galaxy note 4 N910C. That is not true! The phone is N910T. They weren't helpful at all!. If you really need N910C, look elsewhere"
no,no,yes,"Short and sweet, if I could marry this phone I would. My onload problem is connceting to 4g lTE sevice i america. Does anybody of other Carriers hat Will allow me to have true 4glte on this phone. BTW thsi phoone is a Galaxy Norea N9160 32 Unlocked GSM 4glte Ocata-fore sportphone. Any tips?"
no,no,yes,Had to confirm it to be in English but then my voicemail messages were shown in a none gish language in the notifications... I think I fixed it by going to settings and switching the device language back and forth... and restarting between changes... I think there is an let function missing.
yes,no,no,"My previous Note 4 was lte capable and I spent over a hundred dollars more to get that capability again with this phone. HOWEVER, This phone does NOT operate with 4g lte. The phone also freezes often when using the built in talk to text or when using apps that require internet access."
yes,yes,yes,"From buying a cell phone online and getting it through the mail doesn't sound appealing, but I was wrong. The note 4 came in great condition and easy to connect to my provider. I recommend this to everyone I know."
no,no,no,"I am a big fan of samsung, but this phone has had quality issues. The BACK button doesn't work. It appears to be a common problem. Check the phone closely and be prepared to return it quickly. Don't buy for a gift and wait a month before you open it."
no,no,no,"My experience too was not and isnotgoing very smoothly. I found battery to last only 24hrs, didn't want or understand that it would be a phone for the uk. Ihave yet to get it to work on tmobile properly w 4g,etc. Also wrong plug as well."
no,no,no,Its not worth to buy as you will get irritated when it gets creating problem after 6 months. I purchased this phone 6 months back.. Problems which I face.. 1) Mobile gets hanged then no other way I need to remove the battery and put it back. Even the power button won't work when its get hanged.

no,yes,no,"Nice phone, but bad speaker."
yes,yes,yes,"Because of failing vision, I bought the Note 4 (my third Galaxy) primarily for its screen size and font size, and was surprised by the wealth of other features. For example, S-voice, which is like iPhone's Siri,does so many tasks, like addressing a text message, providing for dictating the text,..."

yes,yes,yes,"VERY GOOD , NO PROBLEM IT WORK FINE"

yes,yes,yes,Everything as expected.
no,no,no,"Edit: (04.26.15) After contacting them a few times between now and January, a competent employee finally gave me the info on how to make 4G work for T-Mobile. Should of came with these very important instructions as I've had to change my service multiple to compensate what wasn't even T-Mobile's..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, great screen and camera. Wish it had better fingerprint scanner."
no,no,no,I don't kwow 5 starts for this phone is different version.the processor is 1.9 not 2.7 octacore. Because is international version and no warranty.
yes,yes,yes,"This is an awesome phone, it does everything you want it to and more. The multi window feature is so useful, I don't know how I lived without it before this. Upgraded from an LG G2 and am loving it."
no,no,no,Turns out this phone is not fully compatable with the T-Mobile network and I have had nothing but problems with it from the timne i got it. It is not ment to be used in America. Basically wasted my money on a useless phone and would not reccomend to anyone.

yes,yes,yes,Thanks this was worth it . Will be ordering from you guys in the future
yes,yes,yes,Arrived faster than expected! This is a great phone and much more affordable than purchasing from AT&T (which is around $680 total) though the unlocked version has no warranty. I've had mine for over a month now and it works flawlessly with AT&T's 4G! Can't wait to test it when I travel overseas!
yes,yes,yes,The best smartphone I've ever owned!
yes,yes,yes,It is better than any iPhone I used.
no,no,no,This phone literally is a piece of junk. The charger and the headphones broke within the first month. After five months the screen went black and does not work. My warranty conveniently ran out after five months so trying to get this company to fix it is a nightmare.
no,yes,no,"Ever since I have had the Note 4, I experience random crashes and rebooting. It does not matter what time of day or what application I am using. It crashes and automatically reboots. Since I am in IT I have waited patiently for a firmware fix. I figured there had to be one."

no,yes,no,does it work with Wind Mobile ???
yes,yes,yes,Quite an amazing phone. The specs make for a robust and powerful machine. It can rival many lower end laptops in its capabilities and surpasses in speed. Amazing! (one tiny little note. When connected to LTE the phone just says 4g. After testing though it was proven to have LTE.
yes,no,yes,Your international version Note 4 comes with the snapdragon 805 (or 810) and Exynos 7? I will give 5 stars with you answer. Thanks

yes,no,yes,"Samsung really worked on the Note 4's S pen making it feel more like a pen and work like one. Thanks to the pen's enhanced pressure sensitivity, Note 4 offers one of the best digital hand writing experiences . Also the Note 4's photo note feature stands out. and last but not least.."
yes,yes,yes,"Works very well. I bought this phone for someone and to date, I have not received any complaints."
yes,yes,yes,Everything as agreed.

yes,yes,yes,Everything was perfect. ..
no,no,no,VERY BAD WITH DEFECTIVE
yes,yes,yes,Very happy. Great phone.
no,yes,yes,"This phone doesn't have 4G LTE.Sometimes the key board acts crazy. The letters ""s"" is replacing the ""z"" in words. It continuously has a pop up the comes on the screen ""Refreshing Sim data"", and lately my phone log for the current and previous day isn't showing up."
yes,yes,yes,100% satisfied. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone, as usual, but still a little too touchy for me"
yes,yes,yes,"Depending on what you're look for on Samsung Galaxy Note smartphone platforms, I think this Galaxy Note 4 N910C has it all. There is no need look further or to jump for the preceeding odd model of this Note 4 because of the limiting features of the hardware. Don't get me wrong though."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone but was lacking complete charging system. Missing part that plugs into USB fast charger.
yes,yes,yes,"Pretty awesome phone, very fast, haven't lagged onde, at least until now, the 3 gb of ram are definetely doing its thing, updated to android 6.0.1 as soon as I connected to a WiFi, has a beautiful big display. Overall a great buy."
no,no,no,I had the phone for 6 months and now it wont turn on. I took it to a repair shop and they said the mother board needs to be replaced. Wasn't a battery or charge port issue. This is upsetting. 6 months and now it doesn't work.
yes,yes,yes,fantastic buy < great phone S7 has nothing on it and most people i know with one have had them over 2 years only need to change battery and it keeps going!
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I have ever had. Everything you need in a phone with a few extras. Would recommend this phone to anyone. Well worth the money.
yes,no,yes,"I bought this phone as a Christmas gift for my husband. He loves it! We needed an unlocked phone because we live in Korea and travel to other countries in Asia, in addition to visiting the USA every summer."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone! Blows any iPhone away! Best phone I have ever owned! Samsung comes through once again!
yes,yes,yes,Just what I wanted! Excellent
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. It came a day late but it was sealed in original box. Been using note 4 for about a month works perfectly...
no,yes,no,Not shipped as advertised...came with wrong build and OS....returned but a beautiful phone
yes,yes,yes,Lots of improvements of the note 3. The 1st thing I noticed us how quick the note 4 booted in 10 seconds... wow so fast.... and the second thing I noticed after 5 min of heavy usage the phone does not get hot at all. GREAT SCOTT!! Having 2 cpus on one phone is like adding another turbo to a car.
yes,yes,yes,The Best Phone in market.
yes,yes,yes,Phone is great. No warranty from Square trade or Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,I love my New Galaxy Note 4 ☆☆☆☆☆
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. No problems!!
yes,yes,yes,It works like brand new great battery life and fast response. Has an amazing camera!!!!!
no,no,no,"I bought this phone last year and later found out that it was not unlocked for me to use. I can't make calls, text or anything. By the time I realized that the Verizon system keeps me from using the phone, the allowed 30 day period to return had expired. The IMEI number doesn't match the serial."
yes,no,yes,I like it unique ability to adapt
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone last summer and it has been a dream! I recommend it to everyone. I love the camera, it is superior to any other phones camera that I've seen. The screen size is wonderful and there are many great cases to keep it protected."
yes,yes,yes,Works in the USA and outside of the country like a charm. Great product.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, excellent camera, and has a removable battery."
yes,yes,yes,"Wish the price was lower when I bought it but this is in my opinion the last good phone before the non removable batteries and removing the sd card slot. Would have kind of liked the usb 3.0 with quickcharge on this though, the battery is a weakpoint."
yes,yes,yes,"Full HD, super funny to draw and take notes."
no,yes,no,"The description is the Samsung Galaxy Note N910C Unlocked, it is actually the N910T and it is locked to T Mobile."
yes,yes,yes,"This was my third Samsung phone having owned the galaxy s2 and s5. Both phones were execellent. Never had any problems. So I decided to upgrade and stick with Samsung. I purchased this in December 2015. In March of this year, the camera app wouldn't open."
yes,yes,yes,Graet still in use
yes,yes,yes,Great phone but i hate all yhe loaded Samsung apps sure I use a few but would prefer if i could uninstall the one i dont use
no,no,no,Battery cannot hold for more than a day even though with very low usage.
no,no,no,Didnt work full LTE with tmobile in Texas so I had to return. Not truly this phones fault as it's listed online
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone. Best one Samsung made before they shaved features to squeeze into the tight curved glass and metal designs. Honestly, the 910c is so fast and smooth there's no need to upgrade to the newer ones unless you must have the newest and greatest style. Excellent battery life as well."
yes,yes,yes,All components arrived organized and in tact. Quite an excellent phone; I got it so I could root it and did just that quite seamlessly.
no,yes,no,"Seller vendor Breed, it was shipped sealed and brand new but I noticed the back button was very weak responsive time so I thought this will go away and been a month it's getting worse and I have to press the back button hard enough to function properly."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product
no,yes,no,"Within a day or so of getting it it began overheating and battery wouldn't last longer than one hour, both batteries the same -- while setting on the shelf untouched. Get anywhere near the screen and the it started flipping through apps and pages. Phone worked tho."
yes,no,yes,Best Phone Work for working.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome. I had a Note 2 for three years, but years of use ended my favorite phone ever. If I had known I would like the Note 4 this much I would have gotten it when it first came out. A couple of things to know and remember."
no,no,no,Stopped working After a month and a half it stopped working. I could not claim because the international version of phones sale do not have insurance and I could not claim.
yes,yes,yes,"Galaxy Note 4 is want I am looking for, is good mobile. Light weighted, good looks and awesome Screen resolution. Only problem I am facing with this product is I am getting noisy voice when I connect headphone. Might be this is only specific to this particular piece but that is very annoying."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. Its Faster than my previous GN3 and better battery performance too. Newer style and design looks so better. Another thing i noticed is thats GN4 runs cooler than GN3. Battery charge is very fast. Ultra energy save function is so useful.
yes,yes,yes,"I am a long time Note user.. Started with the NOTE, skipped the note 2 as it just didn't seem to offer up much. Then I updated to the Note3 European unlocked and also purchased the ATT note3.."
yes,yes,yes,The phone is exactly as described. Oddly there was a fingerprint on the box and I wondered if it has been used. Appears to be totally new. It's gorgeous and I am surprised at the learning curve I have as I had a Note 2. It's perfect and I love it. I forgot to submit this and I am glad I did.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product.
yes,yes,yes,Nothng to complan...EXCELLENT PRODUCT..!! Works like a charm...!!!
yes,yes,yes,"It works perfectly and looks nice. I am using it with At&t ""pay as you go"""
yes,yes,yes,came in time. product is good.
yes,yes,yes,"After searching for a while and hate Samsung for S6 no SD, I decided to go for Note4. Happy with the choice. Exactly what I was looking for."
yes,yes,no,I purchased this phone from Delta Mobile and arrived very quicky and it was as advertised. Except that they neglected to mention that there is no warranty. Not from them or way more importantly from Samsung.
no,no,no,I got a charger that will not work in my country. I had to go out and get a converter. This was not described in the product description. People please be aware.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! No complaints! Works well with no issues. Using it with Straight Talk...
yes,yes,yes,Cellphone is very fast compared to my Verizon Galaxy S5. I connected mine to Cricket Wireless and it works great!
yes,yes,yes,"Works great. The only and I mean only issue I've ever had, was when I'm laying down watching YouTube videos. The accelerometer will get confused and do spirals of the YouTube video. I just turn my phone a little bit then back and it's fine"
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this phone for almost a year now, and it has been the best phone I have ever had! From the ease of use, and strong front glass, I would recommend this phone to any wanting a new device."
no,no,no,Phone OK but big charger plug for the United Kingdom England we can't use it in States
no,no,no,I received the N910H instead of the N910C.
no,no,no,An Unlock att phone. To fix to Data data roaming need to be able (check) for tmobile data to work in usa. Top left corner touch not work need multiple tap. Could be software or calibration issues. Tmobile 4g pretty cool. Data work only when on call before fix.
yes,yes,yes,Amazing Top notch beauty
yes,yes,yes,Best phone ever made by samsung!
no,yes,yes,"The item work perfectly as described. The only issue is the plug that came in the package is for a different region and does not work in US. I have a separate charger, so it is not an issue. Would recommend to buy from them if you are looking for a new phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone and tablet. Have to adjust to the larger size as I cannot carry it on my waist due to size and prevention from damage; wearing shirts with breast pockets helps but I am still trying to figure a solution independent of shirt, cargo shorts and pants."
no,yes,no,"Just to help others in the US out who are contemplating getting the N910C model, I'm with AT&T and it does NOT show the LTE sign when connected to AT&T mobile network, it should theoretically since the C covers all the bands that AT&T use I think but it only shows up as 4G, I even took the phone in..."
yes,yes,yes,"Some said it would never catch on, but here we are four years on from the original Galaxy Note phablet with the fourth generation device - the Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The Galaxy Note's big screen and S Pen stylus are certainly not for everyone."
yes,yes,yes,"A nice upgrade compared to previous models. It feels made of premium materials, nice touch with the metal band and slick glass screen. Screen protector isn't necessary with this device. I got this phone to finally get LTE with my service."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. This is a the best phone I have ever owned. It worked well in the USA and the Caribbean (Trinidad/ Barbados) I was considering choosing the Samsung galaxy s6 but I did not like the idea of not being able to expand the memory. I am glad that I choose the note 4.
yes,yes,yes,The phone was as described and it works perfect.
yes,yes,yes,"My dreams that have come true!!!! I can it's big but fits in the pocket ok, and the stock battery is actually really good! With normal use I got 30 hours on one charge and that was with heavy texting and some game playing as well. So far I bought it for my byop strait talk plan and it's been great!"
no,yes,yes,there's no way back from Note! I just put chip in and started with settings. Everything working fine even with the corporate airwatch which email service is just horrible but not related to the phone. touch of the screen is super and works so fast.
yes,no,yes,This thing rocks. It's a must have unlocked is the way to go.
yes,no,no,I have a Samsung note 3. I have decided to buy a note 4. Unfortunately I am experiencing similar problems I was having with the note 3. Both phones are getting warm while in use. The more serious problem with the new note 4 is that it is getting so warm it approaches hit.
no,no,no,"I was extremely disappointed about this phone's charger. It came with an adapter, since the phone's charger is not compatible with US plugs. I did not expect to be carrying around such a bulky device, which is awkward to carry in a handbag."
yes,yes,yes,A VERY NICE PHONE. DELIVERED ON SCHEDULED DATE. I REALLY LOVE IT
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone! Would not have it over any other model. Nevertheless, it has its own flaws like the super soft aluminum bazel that easily gets scratched even by my phone case, it heats up a bit more than usual and touch wizz is definitely not the best interface out there."
no,yes,yes,"Not really what I expected. This model seems to have issues connectin to the TMobile data network. Never would it give me 4G LTE, OCCASIONALLY would I get a 3G connection. Ontop of it all I had to deal with a factory Hungarian configuration, so if you do not speak Hungarian, you will have some hard..."
yes,yes,yes,"This Note 4 is an awesome phone that has far exceeded my expectations. I have gone from using both a cell phone and a tablet to just the note...it's both devices combined into one! The graphics are amazing, Excellent devise."
yes,yes,yes,"The Best Phone Ever Arrived Just Perfectly pretty fast, update it to lollypop 5.1 and no lag so ever, im using it on Venezuela and Works 4G LTE with Movistar and Digitel i haven't tried on Movilnet because that company SUCKS i will buy this phone again"
no,no,no,Received package today. Noticed the seals on the cell phone box were broken. Opened the box and there wasn't a phone in it. Extremely disappointed! Now I have to go through the refund process probably a minimum of 10 days!
yes,yes,yes,AWESOME! Had to get a sim from MetroPCS for 29 bucks works great!!!!
no,no,yes,The box has been opened and the paint around the charging area has been peeled off so
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this so it would work when I am in Argentina as well as here in the US. It was specifically designed by Samsung for South and Central America, but the 4G LTE bands also cover what AT&T offers: 4G HSPA and HSPA+: 850 MHz (Band 5), 1900 MHz (Band 2); LTE: 700 MHz: (Band 17), 850 MHz (Band 5),..."
no,no,no,"The display of the phone was defective; purple color covered its left side. In addition, the SIM was VERY difficult to insert / pull. Bottom line; I had to return the product immediately and ask for a refund."
yes,yes,yes,Very good product and they delivered as advertised.
yes,yes,yes,Just what I expected!
no,no,no,I started out with T-Mobile when I bought this phone. After talking to a few service reps updated the apn settings and I got 3g up and running. Could not get lte to work. I then switched to At&t after reading some reviews that said lte would work with them.
yes,yes,yes,usually used apple devices and this is my first android device. it works well and great! impressive.
yes,yes,yes,Very good product. Very premium. It's the best!
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone and working perfectly
yes,yes,yes,Excellent all came on time.
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned a GS3, a G Note Pad 2, GS3 Mini. And i must admit the Note 4 is far better. Takes some time to get used to it. And because i like to draw, the S-Pen is always in use."
yes,yes,yes,"The product is very nice, thank you. If I write you a problem"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product was what the description was saying the only thing is that it has Spanish language.
yes,yes,yes,It has been really wonderful since last month to use this phone. Ptel prepaid service related to tmobile is working really good with this phone. Charging is working very fast.
no,no,yes,This phone doesn't come in Spanish language
no,yes,yes,Wrong specs for this phone this phone has the snapdragon motherboard
yes,yes,yes,This phone beat out all expectation everything run excption smooth
yes,yes,yes,The is superb...i love the thin design and the dimension of this phone...the features and the quality of camera is one of the quality i've seen.
no,no,no,Does not work this phone work with vodafone
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone for a few days and it works great. The only issue that i have is that the included charger is European and comes with a flimsy US adapter which attaches loosely. It makes it difficult to plug into a wall recptacle because it is trying to support the wait of charger.
yes,no,yes,Using on Straight Talk
no,yes,no,I was unable to activate it on my network. It didn't have a data card with it and it wouldn't accept the one from my phone.

yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, except it's international version which doesn't support 4G LTE!"
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N910H is an Asian-pacific 3G variant WITHOUT 4G and NOT a European model.
yes,yes,yes,"It is simply an amazing device, I have both the iphone 6 plus and this and I prefer the samsung out of the two. My 6 plus is my comport blanket as I have been an iOS user for 7 years. It is simply so fast and so many things to discover."
no,no,yes,This is NOT the European version and will not support LTE in the UK. The ONLY model of the Note 4 fully compatible with UK networks is the N910F.
yes,yes,yes,Just discovered this phone is NOT European capable. NoT 4G compatability in the UK ... had it checked a Samsung Cardiff shop... Seller has ripped me off.
yes,no,yes,I had the Note 4 on my to-buy list for almost 4 months. I waited because I knew Samsung would be releasing the Note 5 and I wanted to see what the Note 5 would offer. Samsung screwed up big time with the Note 5 because you can' t replacle your battery NOR expand memory/space like you can with the...
yes,yes,yes,I'm still learning how to use my phone. I only have had it for a couple of days now. But I really love it.
yes,yes,yes,I owned the first galaxy note and still hadn't learned everything about that one but I wanted to treat myself with an upgrade for a better camera. I LOVE IT! I may never need another upgrade now that I have this. It's smooth and fast!
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great, probably the best I have ever used, the one thing that makes me put it 3 stars is that since I have had it, the IR is not working. I have tried different apps not just the one that comes form default but I cant get it to work."

yes,yes,yes,"Its the best item , and it was delivered in perfect time is awasome"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Beautiful screen display. Has all the bells & whistles. Great camera. Only thing i dislike is they changed the old menu button normally on the lower left corner to now show last 3 pages visited. I think that's stupid, but some people may like that. Otherwise i think they hit a home run."

yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, fast, comfortable to use, Android well designed. just fine. Would not go back to iphone ever."

yes,yes,yes,"This is the smartest phone I have ever had, so I am still discovering all the bells and whistles. The pen function has made the expense worth it. I was able to take notes from a selectboard meeting to write a news article, but I am still learning how to run the filing system and whether Evernote is..."

yes,yes,yes,Very good. Not as excellent because it consumes a lot of battery. If you are someone who makes extensive use of internet and multimedia features not recommend (that's my case and battery with full effort one day of use). That is the only negative factor on the phone.

yes,yes,yes,i will recommend this phone is the best...
yes,yes,yes,"My son is totally enjoying this phone. He is so happy with it. He has been asking me to pre-order this phone, but I ignored him.

yes,yes,yes,I switched from an IPhone 6 + to this phone because I was switching from ATT to Tmobile and wanted a cheaper phablet. I figured this would be the next best thing to my IPhone and I kind of right.
yes,yes,yes,worth every penny!
yes,yes,yes,"Easiest set up I've ever gone through with a phone...that's saying a lot since this is replacing my S5 active and that phone is pretty damn awesome.

yes,yes,yes,I love this phone.Its the best phone yet
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Very attractive and fun to use.

no,no,yes,"The phone is AWESOME, but it was NOT unlocked. I bought in the states, moved to Dubai and it wouldn't work. I had to go to a Samsung office and have it sent out to get unlocked. Cost about $20 and 4 days. Transitioning to the UAE is difficult enough. This was a pain in the butt."

yes,yes,yes,this is the best phablet i have had so far and i have tried both this model and the apple 6 plus and the Note is just amazing!
yes,yes,yes,"I owned the original Galaxy Note, plus I owned the Galaxy Note 2. Thus I’ve been using big phones, or phablets, long before it was cool to do so. I still recall people calling my Note 1 an “iPad Phone” and snickering. Oh how times have changed. I was excited to get my hands on the Galaxy Note 4."

yes,yes,yes,I've had a cracked S3 ever since my new employee decided to walk through a GM plant while on his cellphone. Spun around so fast the S3 never saw it coming. Short of this story is that i've waited a LONG time to choose my new phone.
yes,yes,yes,Well i have received my phone but iam a little concerned about the back cover. At the bottom it says Samsung but at the top it says some weird name. Not Galaxy Note 4 . It says Olleh O something like that. I did not get what was on the picture. So i want a refund. Not even sure its original
yes,no,yes,I had a sony xperia ultra. but I dropped it from the roof. I was happy when this note4 arrived an International Version Sm-910. I feel it slower than my old Xultra.sometimes screen dims in sunlight. Its trublesome to hold it. I end up pressing the back buttom all day.
yes,yes,yes,Note 4 is an awesome device. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone. It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 and 3 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 3 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them.
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had a little time to use this, so this is just my general overview. For technical specifications and professional reviews, there is always ""Google it.""

yes,yes,yes,"I've had this Phone for a while, even with the 6.0 Android Jellybean Update, the battery life of this phone, is kinda below average. Now, I will say this, the overall production of this phone is Exceptional!"

no,no,no,This phone is not even 3 months old and already is not working. I have called my network provider and it is not them its the phone. I have never been so upset. After paying over 358.00 dollars for the phone one would think it would last at least a year if not 5 to 6 years.

no,yes,yes,the battery does not work well
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone! It does so many things! Great phone!
no,no,no,"Be warned, do not buy this phone. I know it clearly states that the phone is unlocked for GSM, I can tell you, IT IS NOT. The advertisement is wrong and it is only compatible with CDMA carriers like Verizon and Sprint."

no,no,yes,Was not a true unlocked phone
yes,yes,yes,When the galaxy note 4 was released in 2014 my sister upgraded to a AT&T model from a galaxy S4 from the same carrier. She live in the USA and I'm living in Jamaica. She told me how impressed she were with the galaxy note 4 so much so that I fell in love with the device myself.

yes,yes,yes,These phones are not unlicked.
no,yes,no,"I like the phone but it has some issues. For one, when I turn it on after being off overnight, the battery will die. Another is when I am using my data it tends to lose connection every now and then."

yes,yes,yes,Everything is good expect it belongs to Verizon and I receive message voice every day. ...
yes,yes,yes,Amazing product.
yes,no,yes,"Good, but software update available if not used with Verizon (or have a verizon sim to update)"
no,no,yes,"Upon seeing that the phone is listed as ""UNLOCKED"" I would have thought, that this was true. Fortunaltey I was able to keep my ophone number. however I was not too thrilled to have to switch over to Verizon. I got the Message ""Insert a Verizon Sim."" So that What I did."
no,yes,no,"I bought this phone for my girlfriend, and it is not a new phone at all, nor is it unlocked. It is a Verizon phone and can't be easily used with other carriers such as AT&T that we have. On top of that, the phone didn't work well at all and we need to return it. The phone call quality was horrible."
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone! Thanks
yes,yes,yes,"Great product, everything I expected. Great deal. Looking forward to future purchases."
yes,yes,yes,I got this as a gift. The purchaser purchased it from a seller called Open Group Wireless. I love my note 4. Its pretty big but hey all the better for me because I love taking pictures and making snaps lol. The quality is excellent.
no,no,no,"Phone was not unlocked. Came in Verizon case and Verizon locked. I followed instructions on how to unlock it for my AT&T; however, nothing seemed to work. Could not send/receive text messages nor did the 4G ever show up."
yes,yes,yes,I'm sure this a great phone as I have a note4 but this one was advertised as a GSM phone but would not accept my sim card. Had to send it back and get another one.

yes,yes,yes,I love the Note 4.
yes,yes,yes,It works great for where I live. I use Strighttalk
yes,yes,yes,great display and big screen make daily use super enjoyable. only downside of this phone is size. It will require time to get use to carry this around unless willing to carry on backpack or so.
no,no,yes,"BUYER BEWARE. The Note 4 is great gear but this is NOT the unlocked Verizon version (also known as the Developer Edition). Falsely labeled. EDIT: OK, I have to tone down the language written in anger. There are two types of ""unlocked""."
no,yes,yes,Love the makes reading the screen much easier for having bad eyesight. Only reason I took a star was for a Samsung glitch of at times not being able to read my yahoo e-mails. Once I click on the e-mail the body of the e-mail itself is blank. Makes for a very frustrating moment.
no,yes,yes,"Phone is listed as unlocked however when I insert a T-mobile sim into it I get an error message saying ""please insert a Verizon sim."" Overall I love the phone just don't like that it's not as ""unlocked"" as the title would suggest."

yes,yes,yes,A brand new Note 4. Works great so far. I used the StraightTalk Bring your own Phone plan to use it through their services while piggybacking on Verizon's network. So far could not be happier.
yes,yes,yes,Edit: SCE contacted me and resolved all issues . Thank you! Excellent phone looks brand new!
yes,yes,yes,I had a Note 3 previously and got this as an upgrade since I didn't want the Note 5 (I need replaceable batteries). One thing I didn't anticipate was that the note 4 Verizon version cannot be rooted! This was a huge problem for me because I wanted to be able to multi-task with multi-windows.
yes,yes,yes,For those who ordered the phone at 1.66 did you actually get it or not. Sounded to good to be true
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone and very good costumer service.
yes,yes,yes,Totally the BEST!
no,yes,no,Will it work for virgin mobile?
yes,yes,yes,"You can't go wrong. This particular phone is absolutely the best. You can not buy a better version of this phone. If you NEED the best of the best, this is the phone for you. DO NOT go any where else. This is it. I'm a avid online shopper."
no,no,no,This phone must be configured to work with T-Mobile but it does not come with instructions. Once configured properly it works like any locked phone. Also PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS AN INTERNATIONAL VERSION WITH NO WARRANTY ACCORDING TO SAMSUNG.

yes,yes,yes,"Works GREAT, very satisfied."
no,yes,no,"I ordered two of these, but they both had the same problem: the GPS did not work. I tried a variety of options suggested by googling this problem, but none worked. This is a known problem with the Note 4. Just search for ""Note 4 GPS does not work""."
no,no,no,I bought the version 910F and 910G received the version . I have been cheated.
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone. Have no complaints. Thank you for the kind professional service.
no,no,yes,"The phone itself appears to work correctly, I like the features and I love the s-pen for drawing. The problem is that the battery dies after about two hours of use. I am not even playing games or anything intensive during this time, all I am doing is loading a few web pages and reading PDFs that are..."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm in CA, USA using the TMOBILE netwrok, 4G LTE speeds work great, and phone calls work great too!"
yes,yes,yes,"I owned the original Galaxy Note, plus I owned the Galaxy Note 2. Thus I’ve been using big phones, or phablets, long before it was cool to do so.

no,no,no,I wasn't satisfied with my purchase i paid for a unlocked mobile phone and I did not get a unlocked phone very disappointed
no,no,no,the phone is locked to network in Venezuela
yes,yes,yes,this thing kicks ass. First thing I did before putting all my data/contacts/apps/simcard in was remove as much of touchwhiz and bloatware as possible. I do have to say the touchwiz has gotten a lot better compared to my galaxy S3.
yes,no,yes,Beautiful phone. I've been using prepaid phones for years now. But their servers have always been problematic. I wanted to go with a better carrier without being locked into a silly contract so I decided to by an unlocked phone. The phone is exactly as described. Brand spanking new and unlocked.

yes,yes,yes,Nothing to say. Excellent.
yes,yes,yes,i ordered the white model and got the black one. this is crazy.
yes,no,yes,It is like having ATT phone with no restrictions for ATT customers.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone with great battery life. It works with most major network bands all over the globe. Seller is also very considerate and will include a adapter for the US.
yes,yes,yes,"It works great. I love the phone but since it doesn't work on the primary T-Mobile band, it can have terrible reception in areas that I had perfect reception with my previous phone."
no,yes,yes,"i was trying to connect this phone on tmobile , and they are telling me this phone is a black list wtf??????"
yes,no,yes,"Due to the phone being pretty cheap, T-Mobile is still selling it for 400 dollars in late 2016, I feel that I got a really good deal for 220 bucks. Anyway, the phone came and the box it came in looked like it was thrown around by the handlers but the bubble wrap packaging inside was sufficient..."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had the phone for two days now and so far it works great. But when I turned it on, the start up screen has Japanese writing, and some other features are written in Japanese but it was just stuff like website suggestions, and the time/weather and location is automatically set to another..."
yes,yes,yes,Nice. Thk u guys.
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome,thank you"
no,yes,no,I like the phone okay but I'm very disappointed with the screen display. It has a very noticeable purple hue in the top half of screen. I only really see it if it has a white background. I didn't notice it when I first got the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had a little time to use this, so this is just my general overview. For technical specifications and professional reviews, there is always ""Google it."" To make this review as efficient as possible, I will do a quick run-over, and also a comparison with other phones you might be most..."
no,no,no,After using the phone for about three days of normal usage i would charge the phone overnight and use it in the day. the phone would go dead at 50% charge. This is not what i expected.
yes,yes,yes,"I owned the original Galaxy Note, plus I owned the Galaxy Note 2. Thus I’ve been using big phones, or phablets, long before it was cool to do so. I still recall people calling my Note 1 an “iPad Phone” and snickering. Oh how times have changed. I was excited to get my hands on the Galaxy Note 4."
yes,yes,yes,"Excelent product, plug&play in latin america!"
yes,yes,yes,I've had a cracked S3 ever since my new employee decided to walk through a GM plant while on his cellphone. Spun around so fast the S3 never saw it coming. Short of this story is that i've waited a LONG time to choose my new phone.
yes,yes,yes,Great service & awesome phone!!!!
no,no,no,Bought this phone for use in the US on AT&T. Initially there were issues but I was prepared to have some and AT&T helped fix them. One issue I still have is that the carrier websites do not recognize the IMEI # for the phone. I had to speak with someone to get the phone working on the network.

yes,yes,yes,Initially I was confused between iPhone 6 plus and the Note 4. I got a chance to experience both phones and I must say the Note 4 was far better than the iPhone 6.

It's fast, powerful, light, functional, has a great screen, takes awesome photos, has an SD memory card capability, an amazing writing..."
yes,yes,yes,Ordered two of these as gifts for my parents and they love it. Picture quality is amazing too.
no,yes,no,Great phone! Love the size and battery life. However the phone constantly freezes up. I just returned one for the same reason thinking it was that particular phone. However once I got this one I realized it is the 4 series.
yes,yes,yes,"I've been struggling with the Exynos 5433 model N910C for almost a year. I'm an Android power user / flashaholic & I gotta have custom everything. I thought I was buying the right device when I saw ""trltexx"" on Cyanogenmod's site."

yes,yes,yes,"A Truly Excellent Smartphone Pros:- Samsung's S Pen and its functionalities have become theindustry standard now. The Samsung Galaxy Note 4's S Pen has an enhanced pressure sensitivity, and is much more precise than ever before."
yes,yes,yes,this phone is the best phone i have ever owned.
no,no,yes,I received it without the stylus pen and the charger cord was for an apple phone not an android. I have notice that there is something wrong with the charger port it has a hard time to charge even when the cord is new. I really think I paid too much for a used note four soo misleading.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, Brand New as described but I had to return it because I couldn't activate it with my carrier."
no,no,no,"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. THEY SAY IT IS UNLOCKED, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT WORKS WITH ALL CARRIERS, AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT IT DOES NOT WORK WITH ALL CARRIERS. IT DOESN'T WORK."
no,yes,no,"Don't buy this phone! This is not unlocked phone. I purchased this and gave it to my cousin who lives in Philippines, when they tried to use the sim card of their country it is not working. The error message is ""Network Locked"" it means the phone will work for American sim card only."
yes,yes,yes,"In general, this is a good phone. I only wish I were able to upgrade the OS as my husband did with HIS Note 4."
yes,yes,yes,Fit well item was same as described by sellers
no,yes,yes,"I am not happy, the package from the manufacturer had been opened, there is no stylus pen in my note 4, that should've been checked before it was shipped, I'm very ticked off."
yes,yes,yes,Decisions decisions.... Do I buy the 4 or the 5 that just came out? Well I just bought the 4. I had a blu phone and it was fine. The reason I wanted the galaxy again is that the blu didn't have an HDmi port. I couldn't stream video via cable to my TV.
no,no,no,"it only works in China, or Hong Kong or Taiwan. there is no service and repair in the USA. the app store in the USA will not work on this phone cannot make phone calls in the USA. There is a jail lock where the phone works. USA cell phone service do not allow this phone to work"
no,no,no,Phone was SIM LOCKED had to purchase code for $40 additional dollars then it worked. Not true per description. Had the phone for 2 weeks now the volume does not work. When I put head phones or just speaker from phone very low volume. Poor product don't buy from Breed...
no,yes,yes,Phone worked fine for an hour after receiving it then the screen when blank but the phone is still on
yes,yes,yes,Exactly what I wanted...so tired of phone companies controlling my phone content ! Just getting used to it...turned out to be somewhat heavier than i expected but size is great and pen is great and I should loose 2-3 extra ounces to accommodate this phone (LOL !
no,yes,no,If you're getting this phone to use your provider's wifi calling - don't! It will not work. For tmobile subscribers this is critical since they often have poor reception in certain areas.
no,no,no,This phone is consistently loosing connection to my tmobile network and when I connect it to my wireless network it does not work neither. I purchase this product back in November 2014 and I do not think that it should be acting up like these in less than a one of year of purchase.
yes,no,yes,excellent phone but does not work with boostmobile.
yes,no,yes,This phone is the international version for Asia-Pacific for use in America. I really enjoy this phone which comes free of carrier bloatware. Unlocked allows you to go to any GSM carrier with a SIM card.
yes,yes,yes,"Edited 4/2/15. Awesome phone. Upgraded from HTC m8. I got the n910h to work with straight talk, no problem. Came with kit Kat 4.4.4. I just downloaded lollipop 5.0.1 yesterday. Touch seems more responsive. Menus look better in my opinion. It's not having the same problems as the note 3 with lagging."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is amazing and has so many features that I dont think i will be able to use them all until the newer model comes out. Where to start, when you have a near perfect phone!? 1. Screen is the best i have seen. 5,7 inches Quad HD with an amazing brightness just bring videos and pics to life."

yes,yes,yes,No complaints the phone is as described. Brand new unlocked sealed
yes,yes,yes,"I got my note and let me tell you that I absolutely love it. It took me a while to change the settings from Korean to English, but eventually I figured it out. I would buy this product again."
yes,yes,yes,"Having had a Galaxy Note, a Note 2, and now this beautiful Note 4, I am in a position to say how fabulous this phone is. It is slimline, though well built. It is fast, with sharp images. The change to the writing recognition is great."
yes,yes,yes,"My only gripe is that I got it for $760 on Black Friday but the phone is awesome. It looks gorgeous. Best looking Samsung phone hands down. It's fast and the battery life is great. By the way, this is the 64 Bit Exynos 5433 version."
yes,yes,no,"The best phablet made by Samsung. Best: Stunning Interchangeable Battery, Incredible Display, Infrared, Pulse Meter, Spectacular Camera, NFC, Fast Charge Bad: It has no FM radio and poor fingerprint reader. Smarphone Score 9.5 / 10"

yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone! Loved it! So many more features than the iPhone and much bigger haha its an iPhone but cheaper and way more features with it.
yes,yes,yes,"I like it a lot so far. The quality of images and video is perfect. The only inconvenience is the weight. It's really heavy, especially for someone like me who when from Aaron Samsung mini straight to more bulky one."
yes,yes,yes,"I guess Apple made one too many bad choices since Steve's gone, I really have found the iPhone interface to have gotten worse, and moved back to Android - over the years these phones have really come around. This phone has more computing power than my computer. Love it."
no,yes,no,"I'm very concerned about the cellular connectivity of this phone. Compared to my husband's American model Note 2, this phone offers very poor connectivity to AT&T servers. Beware, it does not have 4G LTE capabilities like the phones you get at cellular stores."
yes,yes,yes,Bought it for my mom. She loves it so far.
no,no,no,For some reason the top left corner of this phone keeps freezing and I have to reset the phone in order to get it to work again. Didnt have this problem with my last one.
yes,yes,yes,very good and works perfect
no,no,yes,"I bought this so that I would not be tied to a service contract, but some of the features leave a lot to be desired i.e. turning on/off cell service, data usage is high in background. I had to restrict data to Wi-Fi only so as to not run out of data."
yes,no,yes,phone has been working as intended thus far. sleek design with a unique color...enjoying it.
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful and nice phone

yes,yes,yes,"This phone is everything i thought it would be nothing wrong with it all came on time and packaged perfectly.The only thing this phone is not supported by boost mobile,The phone company ive had for 2 years so i had to transfer to metro pcs so if you have boost think about it i transfered for just my..."

no,yes,no,Dont know why samsung key board keep freezing up
no,yes,no,phone keeps shutting off by itself battery doesnt last
yes,yes,yes,Had no problem activating it with boost mobile. Beautiful graphics and less than retail. I love the freedom of it being unlocked.
no,yes,no,Stopped charging after 6 month. Seller not responding to inquires. There are no software in the USA to re-load software. Phone is basically useless
no,no,no,"This phone is a UK model. Samsung in the US told me ""IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN SOLD FOR USE IN THE US-ALTHOUGH IT MAY WORK WITH SOME US CARRIERS, IT IS NOT TRULY COMPATIBLE WITH US CARRIERS"". Mine almost caught on fire and stopped working after only 8 months."
no,yes,yes,What I really like about note 4: its size and of course camera quality. (Better than my s4.) What I DIDN'T like about it: For some weird reason cell service was worse. A lot worse.
yes,yes,yes,"Waooo, what a glasess beautiful of all i have seeing. Gorgious."
yes,yes,yes,It is making a world of difference in my family. They are really loving it.

yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. Still one of the best phones on the market right now. Great price. Is worth it every penny.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone and stylus that comes with it. Other great options. I use this with Consumer Cellular. You need to call them for phone settings on their network. Android forever :)
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this to replace an AT&T note 4 which started blanking out after 2 years and several falls. It worked great for a couple of months, the camera is even better than the previous phone for some reason even thought they are both Note 4's."
yes,yes,yes,Beyond expectations.
yes,yes,yes,"matches the descriptions, and also works nicely."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had it for less than a month, so I can't say too much about it. I had the Samsung Galaxy S4 before getting this one. So far, so good. Similar interface as the Galaxy. The stylus pen is real nice to have for note taking. The fast-charger adapter is truly fast, which is great."
yes,yes,yes,"No 4G but that was my fault. Ordered a different phone with 4G LTE and reselling this one. The phone itself gets four stars. The purchaser gets one star so they balance out to 2 stars, LOL"
yes,no,yes,I recently ordered this Samsung note 4 for my wife. I have the AT&T Samsung note 3 my self but this international note 4 is awesome works great and we have cricket and it's already unlocked.
yes,yes,yes,Family asked for this particular product so I got it as a gift for them.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent fit and color very sexy
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. Great deal.
yes,yes,yes,It doesn't have Spanish
no,no,yes,This phone is advertised as an international version. I believe the international version has 2 sim slots as well as extra storage card slot. This phone does not have 2 sim slots therefore to use the term international version is false advertising.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. My wife loves it.
no,yes,no,"I bought this phone and after having it for awhile it was great but I woke up one day and the phone was so hot to the touch is fried my phone. It doesn't turn on, it doesn't work at all! I'll never buy again from here!"
yes,yes,yes,Great Phone. Has LTE-A very nice surprise
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful brand new unit. No edge gap as reported by some reviews. Model Number is the SM-N910H which is the International version Exynos Processor.
yes,yes,yes,"I am more than satisfied with Samsungs products, Note 4 was gift to my son, he is more than happy to have Samsung Note 4. Excellent quality !!!"
no,no,yes,"For all of you that may have received the version that says Olleh O on the back case, do not worry. The phone was made in a total of 3 different locations; 2 being in different parts of China and one being in the US. The one that says Olleh O is a well known phone distribution company in Asia."
yes,no,yes,"This is a brazen, no 4LTE, it's like having a Mercedes Benz without wheels"
yes,yes,yes,Wow not sure if I am the only one affected by this but this note 4 I purchased for close to $700 dollars. So far it's not worth the amount. This phone has frozen at least three times since purchased on feb 13th. 2015 Barely 30 days has seen the phone freeze with no incoming or out going calls.
no,no,yes,Claims device is unlocked for international use. This is false.
yes,yes,yes,Was I the last person in the world to acquire a smart phone? It seemed like it. Finally I ventured into a store to look at them .... iPhone 6 or something else? The Galaxy Note 4 won me over for lots of reasons. 1.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been a Note customer since I purchased the Note 2 when it first came out. I preordered the Note 4 and was anxiously waiting until it arrived. I liked the feel of the curves, screen, and weight but hated the fact that the backing feels like leather."
no,no,no,The phone is defective and there is no way to repair or replace.
no,yes,yes,"SM-N910H, this is the model number for the note i got, GSM only NOT LTE"
no,no,no,I am not able to get sim network on this due to sim network unlock pin
yes,yes,yes,The phone meets my expectations. Best phone I have ever used
no,yes,no,"Product description says unlocked international, but packaging says ""American SIM Card Only""?!?! Also an additional sticker on the side saying activation must be done in Americas. Well, I can't open this just to activate it because it was meant to be a present for my niece."
yes,no,no,"What they don't tell you is this phone actually is initially region locked, you must put in a US Sim card and make at least one 5 min call using that ... Well thats fine unless you are in Afghanistan ordering a replacement phone and cant use a us sim card for another 6 months."
no,yes,yes,"The phone works great on WiFi but since it was advertised by WORLDWIDE CELLULAR as ""Unlocked International Model"" and it is practically locked to North America I can't use it on my cellular network."
yes,yes,yes,"My husband bought this phone for me as an update to my Galaxy Note 2 which I had for almost three years. Out of the box the first thing I noticed is that the design is thinner. The screen size is the same but the corners are squared, not rounded."
yes,yes,yes,I am on my third Galaxy Note 4 from Sprint. I exchanged one last Saturday 11/8/14 because the first Note 4 had a problem with digitizing marks from the stylus with a quarter size hole on the right middle of the application whether it was s-note or one-note or autodesk sketchbook.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is all what Samsung said it is, except for touchwhiz, which i immediately removed and replaced with nova launcher. zero lag, battery life- almost two days on average use(4g network)."
yes,yes,yes,I purchased this phone with the intention of using the Gear VR but because this is a Asia Specific phone it does not have Gear VR compatibility. This due the chipset not being correct.
no,no,no,This phone is NOT A TRUE UNLOCKED PHONE!! NOWHERE IN THE ADVERTISEMENT does it say that one must open the phone in the USA for 5 minutes in order for a European SIM card to be able to operate the phone in Europe.
no,no,no,"This phone was not unlocked properly and it is essentially a ""brick."" I was told this by my cell phone carrier and 2 repair shops. They said it is a functioning brick but a brick nonetheless so can't text or receive MMS and other functions are not working."
no,no,no,"Dear seller, kindly advice if I can get a network key to unlock the Samsung note4 that I puchased in February 2015. Unfortunately I'm unable to use the phone abroad, as it requires a network key."
yes,yes,yes,"Love it! I've had the Note 3 for a year before I bought the Note 4, and all the small irritating things I experienced with the Note 3 has been fixed. The S pen is just getting better and better, as well as the multi window function. The downside is the battery. It's really going fast."
no,no,no,"The phone's microphone stopped working after 1 week, can't hear people when they call me. Samsung won't take care of it since it's a phone made in Asia."
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned smartphones since the 90s and was particularly excited to get this model. I chose this over the 5 because of the ability to change batteries. I travel and needed that ability, as well as a micro sd card."
yes,yes,yes,This model has -0- US Carrier software added which is an extreme plus. I didn't realize how great that was until I turned it on and was not presented with any setup screens at all. I will buy non-US International versions whenever possible in the future.
no,no,yes,the product i came with imperfections and apparently the screen was replaced because he had the residue that is glue used and the box has been sealed
yes,yes,yes,"I've wanted this phone pretty much since it came out in October of last year. I decided to upgrade from my rooted and flashed Galaxy S3, which I had been using since 2013. First thing I wanna point out is the sheer strength of the build."
yes,yes,yes,"I owned the original Galaxy Note, plus I owned the Galaxy Note 2. Thus I’ve been using big phones, or phablets, long before it was cool to do so. I still recall people calling my Note 1 an “iPad Phone” and snickering. Oh how times have changed. I was excited to get my hands on the Galaxy Note 4."
yes,no,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 is Samsung’s new flagship device, and the best Android phone to have come out in 2014. This is a new step forward for Samsung despite the aesthetic look reminiscent of all past Note series devices."
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone, extremely fast and the screen resolution is just amazing. I worked at a T-Mobile store and I compared the screen quality and the speed with the lg g3, Sony xperia z3, HTC one m8, iPhone 6 and 6 plus and the 1+ one, and note 4 is best phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, had to switch to AT&T bc it wasnt compatible with verizon and it didnt say so in the description at the time. Speaking about the phone itself, its an amazing phone. It takes a little bit to get used to the size but once you do you wont go small again."
yes,yes,yes,"If I woukd have stuck with Android this would have been my go to phone, but I went with the 6 Plus. Not because Apple is cooler or makes a better phone, but because of content. Better apps across the board. I create music and Apple has a much more music apps for iOS than android."
no,no,yes,"I ordered this phone I loveeee the phone, there was no problems with the phone it was unlocked and just the way they said it was but, the charger that came along with the phone was an IPhone Apple charger."
yes,yes,yes,For most part a great phone compared to any other Android phone but nothing like a iPhone... Especially when comes to the fingerprint reader on my iPhone 6+ put finger on reader just once and unlocks device immediately...
yes,yes,yes,"I have been using this phone for about 6 months , the pros are as usual its screen and the s-pen , viewing content on this screen is just amazing . But here lies the flaw , it sucks up battery life at a ridiculously ."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone at an excellent price. I use the prepain unlimited AT&T service through Straight Talk. SD card only cost me $0.99 (yes, that was 99 cents) and service $46. So pleased with the outstanding camera and cool stylus. Samsung did not disappoint me with this phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"I had a Note2 for the past several years. That thing just wouldn't die, and now my wife is using it (though it might be about dead). I figured the Note4 would be a no-brainer. For the first couple weeks, it was great. I loved everything about this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N9100G(Frost White) (Qualcomm version). Pro 1. Very bright Quad HD display compared to Lg-G3. 2. Beautiful Design, silver like cutting at the edges.Very thin compared to previous versions. 3. Camera is awesome. Pictures always bright."
yes,yes,yes,"OMG!! I LOVE THIS BABY, MY NOTE 4!!!"
yes,yes,yes,I got the LG G3 when it first came out and have used it for over 3 months. I was very happy with the G3 but decided to pass it down to a family member so I could try out the Note 4 (N4). This review is focused on the distinguishing features between the 2 phones.
yes,yes,yes,"What a phone faster than iphone 6 and just a multimedia powerhouse if u want to watch flash download puffin browser, sit back and enjoy woow best phone ive ever owned. I just found out 10-20-14 that this phone is compatible with OTG cable."
yes,yes,yes,I've had a cracked S3 ever since my new employee decided to walk through a GM plant while on his cellphone. Spun around so fast the S3 never saw it coming. Short of this story is that i've waited a LONG time to choose my new phone.
yes,yes,yes,I've had a cracked S3 ever since my new employee decided to walk through a GM plant while on his cellphone. Spun around so fast the S3 never saw it coming. Short of this story is that i've waited a LONG time to choose my new phone.
yes,yes,yes,Note 3 iz Wonderful wrk fo me why keep bringing out new ones....smh keep ppl spending money...ugggg
yes,yes,yes,Note 4 is an awesome device. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone. It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 and 3 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 3 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them.
yes,yes,yes,"I love apple products. My wife and I have two macbook pros, iPhone 5s and have had a couple different generations of iPhones. This phone convinced me to make the switch from apple back to android."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone!!! WOW! But this international SM-N910U does NOT work with AT&T LTE network only 3G/ H+.
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had a little time to use this, so this is just my general overview. For technical specifications and professional reviews, there is always ""Google it."" To make this review as efficient as possible, I will do a quick run-over, and also a comparison with other phones you might be most..."
yes,yes,yes,This was well handled
no,no,yes,One of the locking brackets cracked the first time.I used it but even though I was past my 30 day rtn deadline they were still happy to fix things for me and even waved express shipping if I chose to repurchase the item. I used it once even cracked and it kept the phone perfectly dry inside.
yes,yes,yes,"This is an upgrade from the note 2 and very impressive get to keep my sd card and I can switch the battery to a more powerful one unlike the note 5 which you cannot do either. S pen, camera, speed, and performance are greatly improved."
yes,yes,yes,Just beginning to delve into it's full potential but so far so good.

yes,yes,yes,Item was referbished and not new as stated
yes,yes,yes,"Ran through lots of troubles because of this international version of Samsung even though it was written on box 2 years warranty. Samsung service here in Canada refused to serve it because it was not bought from the local market, of course as well the original seller himself refused to take..."
no,yes,no,"Phone was unlocked as advertised. However it was a T-Mobile phone. T-Mobile is not available in Ontario Canada, and therefore, some functions would not work with my carrier. Probably a good buy for someone in the US. Not satisfactory in Ontario Canada. Returned for full refund."
yes,yes,yes,Works like a charm
yes,yes,yes,"This is great. The price was fantastic. Works perfectly. Anybody who wants a larger phone that almost has the power of a laptop, this is a good place to start looking"
no,no,no,the phone is not connecting to wifi and when it connects once the phone sleep it disconnect and needs to restart the phone to reconnect. the lock screen cannot be changed from finger print to pattern or any unless you restart the phone and for only one time.
no,no,no,NOT A REAL NOTE 4 its locked DONT BUY!!!!!
no,yes,yes,"I'm not sure what everyone above is talking about how the phone is not LTE, I got an unlocked AT&T LTE model (in some areas I get LTE in others it just says 4G). Loving the phone so far too. I'm guessing the other reviewers got an incorrect model or something."

no,yes,no,"This phone is almost worthless, I'm not sure if it's just mine or what but it's horrible. It freezes every couple minutes, every time I try to open the camera it won't let me take a picture and the camera fails. Definitely not satisfied. I've tried to factory reset the phone and it fixes nothing."
yes,yes,yes,This phone perfect. I love this phone. I am not bound to bloatware and network plans. I am abke to continue my unlimited data. I use this phone for business and fun. Just a minir issue. There are some yellow (warm) and blue (cool) patches on the screen.

yes,yes,yes,as very good team experaba and buy it for Venezuela works perfectly on 3g and h + everything very well with this product
yes,yes,yes,"love it , it is much better than iphone 6 plus. More free and very useful APP , faster, comfortable. The full HD is really good."
yes,yes,yes,So far this is the best phone I've ever had. Partly due to ever-improving technology and partly due to it just being a good phone. I love the huge bright screen. I remember considering the Note a couple of years ago and thinking it was too big.
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone. But they need to put that it is not compatible with 4G or lte.. the highest it goes is h+...
yes,yes,yes,International Model - Its heaven.. loosing sleep because of this gem in my hand..:-) Awesome performance.. Good battery life.. Gets heated up while charging.. But soon gets fine..!!!! awesome..:-)
yes,yes,yes,Really loved this phone but when I purchased I did not read reviews or specs already owned a note 4 so I wanted international version I did not realize that it did not have LTE I thought all note 4s would have that feature so i purchased based on price great phone but no LTE was the killer
yes,yes,yes,"The only issue was adjusting to the size of the phone, but that did not take long. This phone is simply amazing when it comes to power and the beautiful display, to the clarity of the camera allowing me to take good pictures without the use of flash in low light where others will have to use flash."
yes,yes,yes,great phone and tmobile 4g service is the best! It is the best phone I ever owned!
yes,yes,yes,"Best smartphone I've ever owned. No headphones in the box...which was annoying, but whatever have my s5 headphones still. 5 stars for the phone 1 star for at&t's ugly packaging 3 stars for incomplete set (missing head phones you would expect from a brand new galaxy device) Overall 3 stars."
yes,yes,yes,Love the Samsung Note 4. Goes anywhere.
yes,yes,yes,This phone offers me great experience so far.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent. Great description. Recomend!
yes,yes,yes,"I've tried Apple products. I have. Currently I have an imac and an Apple iPad. They're okay but, in my not so humble opinion, not better than Samsung's offerings. I considered the Apple 6+ but, knowing the excellence and past history with Sammy, went Note 4. I'm glad I did."
yes,no,no,"Ok the phone is awesome beyond doubt. But i found some issues with the complete package that came to me. The charger which came with the phone was not a phone charger, but some other 3 pin charger which is useless. So i will have buy a new charger for this phone. That's why I was kinda disappointed."
yes,yes,yes,"Well, not much to say about Samsung product in General. I have been using Samsung product for a long time and I like it. The initial price for unlocked phone is too expensive, but if you stay for about two months and price always drops at least by $200.00."
yes,yes,yes,Product is legit. Fully unlocked. No problems encountered yet. Just hoping it stays that way
yes,no,yes,Only downside is that it isn't waterproof.
no,yes,no,"Do not buy. I've had my phone for less than a year. It constantly struggles with wifi, while none of my other devices do. The worst part is that phone will shut off at about 30% battery life."
yes,yes,yes,Phone did not last switched to the iPhone 7 plus
yes,yes,yes,I've had this for 4 years and still working without any issues.
yes,yes,yes,"Ended up getting a different model of the Note 4, and Dario came through on making sure I got what I needed the first time through. The phone came exactly as described."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent. Replaces my tablet, gives me the ability to manage my work on the go. In terms of using it as phone, it's a bit too big, but I use my Bluetooth earpiece and it works perfectly well"
yes,yes,yes,"Had it for over a year now. Still love it, still going strong! Everything works as it should. I don't think I'll be getting a new phone for another year."
no,yes,yes,Gave me a wrong version of mobile. I came to know latter. Refused for any solution saying i was too late
no,no,no,When I receive or make calls I can't hear the calling party and they can't hear me for the first 5 calls and it's so frustrating cos I'm not able to connect with people that are trying to get in contact with me
yes,yes,yes,This phone was amazingly built totally worth the price and the way it was shipped and packaged there is no second guessing if the phone is new I would recommend this product too everyone
no,yes,no,"This review is about Samsung Warranty, not the phone! I actually loved the phone for 49 weeks. I had model N910H. Three weeks before my warranty was up, I started to have battery drainage. Full charge gone in less than 4 hrs with no use & no apps running."
no,no,no,"On the 10th day, phone stopped working. !!!!!!! I bought the international unlocked version for $439 . I could not accept incoming call. A message box appeared saying "" Phone stopped working ""the iscreen froze for a while so I could not get rid of the message box to press "" ok"" so I could not do..."
no,no,no,"I begin by saying that I have usually been a Samsung cell phone fan. Not this time, however. I have now had this phone for not even a year and a half and it has had issues from the start. I have never been able to use the speaker phone function. I can hear fine, but my voice does not get picked up."
yes,yes,yes,Happy with purchase/supply and quality of this item still now 12 months later.
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone I've ever had, still use it to this day without any issues so far!! Definitely recommend to those who want a phone with pen capabilities and overall awesomeness of Android! Have not even considered moving up to the Note 5 yet, 4 is perfect, and pink!"
no,yes,yes,"This is not 4g or lte compatible. Have issues with t-mobile service in cretain areas but that may not be the phone but more the service provider, t-mobiletc."
no,no,no,Product received not as described. Model number incorrect and GPS functionality does not work. Return was made successfully but I had to pay the return shipping.
yes,no,yes,Awesome and very solid phones. Two problems I have and that is it. One is the screen is amoled and if your not careful you will have permanent screen burn in as mine does. The screen replacement is 170. The second problem is that Samsung does not upgrade the touchwiz software to that of the note 5.
yes,yes,yes,"Good quality item, fits perfectly, no fingerprints but it feels slippery, not that easy to grip with one hand."
yes,yes,yes,"My husband recently decided he wanted us to upgrade our phones...and by upgrade, he meant GO BIG! REALLY BIG! I wasn't to keen on the idea of a bigger phone and had to basically be talked into it. But low and behold, it didn't take long for me to completely fall in love!"
no,no,no,Had it for 2 months then one day it over heated and stopped working. Took it to a repair shop and said it has a defective mother board. Contacted seller and said can't exchange or return.
yes,yes,yes,This is a good phone.
yes,yes,yes,It works great and I love my new phone after upgrading from a note 2 because it had too many restrictions from At&t ......I am in the Caribbean and had no problems with upgrades or sum cards
yes,yes,yes,Amazing Product! Highly recommended! Excellent!
no,yes,no,"My mother and i each own one of these phones. About 8 months into owning her phone, it began to restart randomly and calling random people. To solve the problem, she had to contact their customer support to which they gave her the usual set of instructions to troubleshoot her phone."
yes,yes,yes,Love this....works great still having fun learning with it...
no,yes,yes,"I got this phone through a national carrier. I thought I was upgrading, but sadly I didn't. This phone only has 1 antenna, which means you can't talk on the phone and websurf, or check Facebook. I wish I would have known that before I bought this one."
no,no,no,stop working after 6 mounts
yes,yes,yes,"Love, Love Love my new phone. The camera is wonderful too. My previous phone was the Samsung Galaxy 3 while my husband has had the Galaxy Note 3 for years. We love this new phone the most. We also recommend getting your own phone and not be locked into any cellular phone company contracts."
yes,no,yes,S Pen came broke. I need it replace as soon as possible. I also need the USB cable to charge the phone because it came without it. I am not happy at all with what I got.
yes,no,yes,"I purchased a Galaxy Note 4 in September. I had originally wanted a Note 2, as I did not want the extra screen size I simply wanted the stylus feature on the device. However, I am satisfied with the screen size after all."
yes,no,yes,"I have the SM-N910T, the T-Mobile variant of this phone. Make sure that you purchase the variant you NEED. Look up the phone bands you need in your area and what local phones provide and which this model may NOT provide, such as LTE / 4G bands. Do your research before purchase if you're in the US."
no,yes,no,"The screen always freezes and it dies super fast , have to charge it at least 3 times a day"
yes,yes,yes,Purchased this phone a few weeks ago it's working ok so far but it's not brand new it came with the pervious owner information.
no,yes,yes,Got it for my bro. But it's way too expensive for what you get.
yes,yes,yes,Got this device from my carrier. The best phone I have ever had. Super powerful!
yes,yes,yes,I am still learning this phone. I like it thus far.
yes,yes,yes,I love it but it keeps dropping my calls and turning off by itself. I reported it they replaced it with a new one it still has the same problem the only reason I keep it is because I love the pink one I've had all of the order colors
yes,yes,yes,Great product best phone on the market still even after the note 5
yes,yes,yes,Just letting you guys know it's a clone it's the the original the processes is weak just go all out and buy the expensive original one
yes,yes,yes,"Just what they said, is exactly what it is. Works GREAT.............."
no,no,no,Be aware of the design flaw of cracking lens cover glass. I have this phone only 2 weeks and found the rear lens glass cracked. I have never dropped or bummed it. There are other people have the same problems. The glass is not under warranty and it cost $72 to repair. I have the buyer's regret.
yes,yes,yes,"Email sucks. Other than that it could be a great phone. For those of us who get tons of email and don't get to go through it all daily, being able to sort alphabetically is critical. Sorting alphabetically lets us delete spam and unimportant emails quickly."
yes,yes,yes,The best phone I ever get.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this Samsung Galaxy Note 4 N9100G(Frost White) (Qualcomm version). Pro 1. Very bright Quad HD display compared to Lg-G3. 2. Beautiful Design, silver like cutting at the edges.Very thin compared to previous versions. 3. Camera is awesome. Pictures always bright."
yes,yes,yes,As promised and expected
yes,yes,yes,Fast and beautiful
yes,yes,yes,"Received my phone today, it looks great. Thanks."
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome product, bar none."
yes,yes,yes,"All you can say is WOW. This phone is awesome.. Do yourself and someone else a favor. Go to your nearest store, play around with the phone, be amazed, then buy it.."
yes,yes,yes,I've had a cracked S3 ever since my new employee decided to walk through a GM plant while on his cellphone. Spun around so fast the S3 never saw it coming. Short of this story is that i've waited a LONG time to choose my new phone.
yes,yes,yes,Best mobile 2014 & 2015
yes,yes,yes,Note 4 is an awesome device. The resolution and real estate you have is mindblowing for a phone. It is a very powerful device in your hands! I had Note 2 and 3 for a long time and our family is a big fan of phablets. Note 3 are still really good. If you have them and they work keep using them.
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had a little time to use this, so this is just my general overview. For technical specifications and professional reviews, there is always ""Google it."" To make this review as efficient as possible, I will do a quick run-over, and also a comparison with other phones you might be most..."
yes,yes,yes,spen makes this phablet whithout competitors

yes,yes,yes,"I've had a Note 3 for over a year and liked its features. The Note 4 is all that one had and more. I'm very pleased with the service received and the quality of the phone. We use these phones as we travel extensively in SE Asia, and they perform very well using SIM cards from Philippines, Malaysia,..."
yes,yes,yes,"I was expecting this phone to be better than my s5 but i was wrong, i'ts a good phone, works ok, camera is excellent but still gonna get a s6 or s6 edge."
yes,yes,yes,"i got me phone and i love it....it was everything i could have wanted and more, and it pink its so cute. I live in Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean and it work fine with our sim there."
yes,yes,yes,Too cute. Pretty vintage pink I bought a clear cover for it and love it. Lots of new stuff to learn on the phone. The camera is brilliant and has a beauty thing which makes your skin look fabulous!
no,no,yes,I dnt have much to say phone. In fact as the advertising international unluck I false and misleading. I have a note 4 for my wife as using international SIM card I didn't work . It must insert USA SIM In oder to work or to unlock . Now I here in overseas .not soon going back to usa .
yes,yes,yes,"I like it! TouchWiz still gives the device the usual quirks that Samsung phones have, but I forgive it for the device itself. I love the pen--it makes it so much easier when I need to jot down quick notes or maintain my grocery lists."
yes,yes,yes,I love my note 4! Can't even tell it was used
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone. I'm a big fan of the galaxy note, I've owned all of them from 1 to 3 and now 4.not disappointed at all. Phone works perfect."
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. But sometimes the touch screen is too sensitive.
yes,yes,yes,"Yes, it met all of my expectations and than some. I love the color,quality and the fact that it fits in the palm of my hand. Mini computer."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung galaxy note 4❤❤❤❤I love this phone so far. I brought it unlocked and it works well with metro pcs. My phone came right on time on perfect shape. Love it. Thank you.
no,no,no,"Phone was locked contrary to what is promised in the description. When I attempted to use it outside the US, a SIM unlock code was required. Expect to pay more money for a SIM unlock code."
yes,yes,yes,I bought it as a gift for my wife but have to return it because it wasn't compatible with the AT&T network. It doesn't change the fact that it's a excellent phone.
no,yes,no,does not charge like the reviews say it takes 10 to 12 hours some times over night or and in thirty minutes i get a 6% increase in charge with the proper cable and charger that came with it. it also does not say samsung on the charger though it looks like one.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is Amazing and it's pink! it was adequately packaged and shipped and the features on this device as well as the HD footage it offers, phenomenal. I don't think I can part with this phone ever!"
yes,yes,yes,Love it. I upgraded from note 2. The 4 holds better battery charge. Nicer pictures. I love it ☺
yes,yes,yes,I didn't think I would upgrade from my Note 2 but something grabbed my attention in a demo. I am so glad that I did. I adore this iteration of the Galaxy Note and am so glad that I upgraded.
yes,yes,yes,"Really happy with this, I was worried because I have Cricket and I couldn't find this phone anywhere but here, and they were able to hook up service right away. This is the first time I have bought a nice phone and the guilt is gone because it's a great phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone, I already had a carrier branded Note 4, but I love pink, and carriers don't have pink. I went into this knowing it does not do 4G, and honestly I don't notice any difference. I did a speed test with it, and with my carrier branded Note 4, and they both performed the same."
no,no,no,You only can get the phone hooked up with straight talk horrible service
yes,yes,yes,Worth the wait and money. I absolutely love this phone. It was really beyond my expectations.
yes,yes,yes,I love it and I got it the next day as ordered ty much xoxo
yes,yes,yes,Make my job easy to handle. The Samsung galaxy note 4 is great!!!
yes,yes,yes,"I had I pad mini 2 with Retina display; I was angry one day so I hit my I pad on the wall and broke the screen. Now I want to buy new phone and I compered between this device and I phone 6 plus, but really I feel this device is better than I phone 6 plus"
no,no,no,I'm at the united states and the service not 4G ( LTE ) i 'm so disappointed
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good, this one is great for me, I need a few office tools and this one handles them just perfect"
yes,yes,yes,This one great device. Well built and functional. It's design. This phone has great features and as a phablet it very functional. It was bought as a gift for an engineer and so far i get nothing but good price on it s functionality. Ease of use especially since it comes with a stylus pen.
yes,yes,yes,i love this product
yes,no,yes,"Not only did the phone come in quick time, the product was exactly as advertised."
yes,yes,yes,I love the Samsung Galaxy Note. I hope that this one do not die on may hand as it happened with Note 2.
yes,no,yes,"This is Great, But First, this a QUANTUM leap for me in TECH having now given up on my Antique cellphone -also a Samsung. It does FAR more than I currently have command. It is an exceptional device, and it does take a bit of getting used to pecking with the S Pen. As you see it can be done!"
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone.good and new.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone ever....great in every respect....I love it....
yes,yes,yes,The best in the market
no,no,no,"I will never buy another Samsung product again. I sent my phone in to get repair after an update destroyed my battery life and connectivity, three months later after they lost the phone they constantly give me false information and false promises."
yes,yes,yes,"when you buy thought it would be great but I do not think the same now, the phone turns itself off when I call the screen is off and obscures anything, calls whatsapp can not close and I turn off the phone battery does not last long it is actually very easily download I'm not happy with my purchase."
yes,yes,yes,"This by far, is one of the best ease-of-use cells phones I've owned. It has way many more features than I need in a phone. The only issue is the battery not having that same mogo power as when new. I'm one year in use and planning for a second, till the insurance is up."
yes,yes,yes,Phone has an echo....does not have swipe....not impressed at all. Galaxy note 3 is a much better phone
yes,yes,yes,I was worried about what would come but the phone works great. There is a slight imperfection on the back panel but it's barely noticeable.
yes,yes,yes,"outdated but works great. also, it drains a lot of battery. i never got around to figuring out why but I always carry a charger around so it didn't bother me."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this for my sister in law to take back to Mexico and she said that she dint had any problems connecting the phone for service she was very happy thanks will order again for sure
yes,no,yes,2 Weeks into the note 4 life things are going awesome. Then one afternoon while using my phone the screen goes blank. I try and try and try to get it back but to no avail. After doing research on research i found out that i had to factory reset the device which i did and it work.
yes,yes,yes,"So far, so good! Came in excellent condition and had worked perfect a month into using."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone! The description said ""used-good""..but I swear it's like new! And who gets a phone of this quality and doesn't buy a case ? There are no detectable scratches that I can see, the screen is BEAUTIFUL, plus it's running great! .. SO satisfied with my purchase!"
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. It is a good size and easy to handle.

no,no,no,Received the phone cracked. Smh
no,yes,no,Description said like new. Received phone yesterday and power/lock button doesn't work.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone itself is great. However, I can't figure out if it's the battery or if it's my plug but I can't get my phone to charge above 80%. Thankfully I have access to an outlet most of the time so it's not a huge problem. I plan on purchasing a new battery, and seeing if anything changes."
yes,yes,yes,Good phone just takes 10 plus hours to charge while turned off... won't charge while using the phone like my other Note 4 I bought directly from t-mobile
no,yes,no,Phone wasn't new it was used camera lens was broken didn't return it because didn't want to go two weeks without a phone
no,no,no,I had high expectations for this. I had about two weeks before returning it. System functions were not working properly. Good phone if it weren't for the glitches.
yes,yes,yes,Very good price and reliable.
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone. I had been needing one for a long time and l could have easily purchased one of the new l phones..but l have had the best luck with Samsung so that's where l decided to stay. Great Phone!
yes,yes,yes,Arrived brand new and works wonderfully! Thank you!
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this phone from Edge Cellular May 2016. Exterior was in great condition. The S pen worked and is in good condition. It didn't come with Android 6.0.1, but within a week the upgrade was available to upload and no issues installing it."

yes,yes,yes,"I'm glad I upgraded to the note. I don't use the stylus often, but it has come in great handy, especially when it's cold and my hands want to stay nice and toasty inside gloves."
yes,no,yes,This is the 3rd Note 4 I bought and I am very happy with it. The first two died unfortunately due to water exposure. If I would brake this one two i would get right away another one. The Note 4 isn't the latest but has an awesome camera and the fingerprint sensor.
yes,yes,yes,No problems yet i keep updating

yes,yes,yes,The phone is fine just dies fast
no,yes,yes,"The Note 4 is an excellent phone. However, the phone I received had a few technical issues. I've used it for about 3 months now. At first everything was alright...However, things started to die out. The phone wouldn't charge and eventually died. I replaced the battery."
no,no,no,"The Phone is decent otherwise, But the screen is burned in (burn in , is amoled specific, where you can see an image in background, as the screen pixels are burned there..) And the after market charger provided, does not work. Seller : Chubbiestech"

yes,yes,yes,"I paid for new one....I was happy when I got my package, packing and phone looks good. but I found somthing... camera lens was too much scratch (My wife has same samsung note 4 ...She used 1 year but camera lens still fine and clean). S Pen function is not smooth.."
no,no,no,"Included charger seems faulty, as it repeatedly connects and disconnects. This seems to have, in turn, caused the battery to swell and look damaged. After all the note 7 news I can't risk trying to use the battery anymore, and will need to buy an expensive replacement for it and the charger."
yes,no,yes,Samsung note 4 did not work at all
yes,yes,yes,It's kind of problem but it good for now.
yes,no,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 so far seems fantastic. Unfortunately it seems I might have to get it from another seller. Firstly I was under the impression it was 'like new' condition. It came in the original box but it didn't come with any cords, and had some small scuffs on the edges."
no,yes,yes,Battery does not charge 100% and recorded videos look blurry also the pictures don't look crisp
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, the battery caused me a little concern in the beginning, only lasting half a day but after 3 or 4 recharges now easily doing a full day and a bit. One should be informed that this may be necessary."
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome, product... Connects to my big screen with a HDMI - mini USB connection can watch Netflix. Showbox off my big screen TV... very happy with product... only downside is battery discharges faster than most smart phones I've had... so I bought two extra batteries..."
yes,yes,yes,Phone arrived as described in like new conditions. Works fine. No problems.
yes,yes,yes,"When my Note II finally died after almost 4 years I looked at the latest which was the Note 5. The Note 7 was coming out, but I decided I didn't want to pay the expected price. I'm retired now, so I questioned paying if I really needed the note."
yes,yes,yes,Good phone and good price
yes,no,yes,"I bought this for my 13 year old son and he absolutely loves this phone..It works perfectly as it should because it's a brand new phone..Came with everything in the box... Charger, ear buds...It's for T-mobile service so it was an easy transition from the old phone to new phone.."
yes,yes,yes,"Bought from samsung. You guessed right, it is great and I am using the same phone to write this review now. Have been using it for about 4 to 5 months now. I am a heavy user and on my phone from 8am to 11pm maybe resting 3 hours inbetween."

yes,yes,yes,"I have owned smartphones since the 90s and was particularly excited to get a Note 4, having previously (and happily) owned a Note 2. I chose this over the 5 because of the ability to change batteries. I travel and needed that ability, as well as a micro sd card with my secure business documents."
yes,yes,yes,Phone was exactly as advertised. Works great!
no,yes,yes,There's nothing wrong with the phone except the camera. It will take forever to focus and sometimes I have to shake the phone just so it can focus. But overall it's very well. The camera thing doesn't bother me much I can just wait a long Time for it to focus.

yes,yes,yes,Great condition. Love My new note 4.
yes,yes,yes,great product no problem with phone would highly recommend.

no,yes,yes,I love the phone but for some reason the powersaver doesn't work and my phone powers of at 16% everytime and it takes forever to charge sometimes it even powers on and off on its own I think I received a bad batch for the price I paid aside from the defects its a good phone

yes,yes,yes,Is so good thanks note 4 fron T-mobile
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy Note 4 is now going on two years old, but don't think that means it's not a great phone. The newer Note 5 gives you a better camera and faster processor, but you lose the removable battery, Micro SD slot, and the IR Blaster feature that lets you use this phone as a TV remote with the..."

yes,yes,yes,Th cell phone looks really good. Received earlier then expected. The only thing is that I would have liked to have an instruction manual too.

no,no,no,"I was so excited to purchase this phone because the reviews were so good. Unfortunately, I just realized you cannot do conference call on the phone. Also, when you're on a call, if another call should come in, there's no call waiting."
yes,yes,yes,"super small signs of light use but dang near new. great phone, thank you."
no,yes,no,This phone only worked for 4 months and after paying 400 for a phone it should last longer than that and they don't stand behind their products so don't buy from them. They told me they would do nothing and the phone won't even turn on.
yes,no,yes,I Love Samsung. I dropped my note 4 in the toilet and had to buy another one because the phone encountered a circuit shortage. I love this one that I brought because it's a US version verses the international version. The only thing that I didn't like is that I had to get the phone unlocked.
yes,no,yes,Looks and feels new but it force closes apps far too often and overheats quick'af.. No bueno
yes,yes,yes,After everything that happened with getting my phone to me I am very pleased. It's a good phone. I really wish it would have came with a charger.
yes,yes,yes,"Works perfectly! I got the T-Mobile version and I put in my sim card and it was ready to go. Even though mine was used, you could barely tell. Only tiny little buff marks on the back. Screen clean, buttons and stylus in excellent condition. Phone works quickly, smoothly, and the camera is amazing!"
yes,yes,yes,"I was totally blown away, I believe I received the bargain of the century. Everyone was shocked to find out how much I paid. The phone (new) works like a dream. My only regret was I failed to buy two of them. Gave my son my Galaxy 6 and keeping the Note 4, for myself."
no,yes,no,"Any phone from tmobile, work with metro pcs! And don't need to be unlocked ...no worries"
yes,yes,yes,"Pakage came ahead of time but lucky I was home to receive it, anything besides that, the phone runs great for the pass month"
yes,yes,yes,"Yes it meets my expectation, thanks!"
yes,yes,yes,best phone i've ever had. Made the switch from the iPhone 5s and haven't looked back.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent product, very please. I upgraded from a Note 2 to the Note 4. Learning curve was easy. T-Mobile has an online app to transfer from the old phone to the new phone. Very easy to use."
no,no,yes,The screen had images burned into the screen.
yes,yes,yes,its what I asked for. No complaints here.
yes,yes,yes,I was looking for a new cp ASAP (something within the budget since there is a possibility that I might change it within a year or two) and I found this on the listing. Arrived a day early than it should have.
yes,yes,yes,"This is a solid phone, but I prefer something I can use with one hand. (And I have gigantic hands.)"
yes,yes,yes,"So far I like this phone. It works as expected. Since its a T-mobile phone and I am on T-mobile network, no issues encountered as of now. There are few scratches from wear and tear but what can we expect from a used product"
yes,yes,yes,The phone arrived fast and met all of my expectations. I can proudly say that I am a happy buyer and felt like I won on this deal.
no,no,no,My phone was absolutely fabulous until yesterday when suddenly I had no service because my imei # got blocked! So now my phone is useless
no,yes,yes,"I received package faster than expected, and the phone looked great and was able to get activated and then the phone would only stay charged for about a hour.... so I have to purchase a battery for a phone that was supposed to be like new. Now I have to wait another week to even use the phone"
no,no,no,"I bought this phone from Tmobile about 1 yr and 5 months to date. Taken in by all the specs, including the gorgeous colors and playback for videos, I spent a boatload on it. A few days after I received a text from Tmobile thanking me for being a customer for a year, my battery started to drain..."
yes,yes,yes,The Note 4 has been a great phone for me and when my fiance wanted a new device we knew exactly what to get her. It has pretty good battery life and when the signal is poor and the battery gets drained a lot the fast charging is really handy to have.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome works great!
yes,yes,yes,it works With a tmobile sim card?
yes,yes,yes,Phone looks brand new. Was a plug and play with my SIM card. Works great.
yes,yes,yes,I love it. It came on time and it gives me no problem.
yes,yes,yes,"Works awesome, no problem so far"
yes,yes,yes,Bought 2 of these and they both work great. Product came as described. Was a little hesitant at first to buy used. But very satisfied with the purchase. Thanks
yes,no,yes,"The 5* is for T-Mobile. I went from an other carrier and a Galaxy S III. The improvement in both the phone and the carrier are monumental. For a Tech challenged person it will take time to be more fluid with phone functions. There are no regrets, only positive anticipation."
yes,yes,yes,"Even using 4.4.4 kitkat, still very fast & responsive. T-Moble brand ultra compatible with my 4g lte provider, so much so that this model is issued as is. This model is very responsive and contains less restrictive programing than att or verizon if you know how to root using online methods."
yes,yes,yes,"When I bought this I was skeptical, but it got here fast, it looks virtually new, and the box and accessories came with it in the original packaging, the screen had a protector on it, and was without a scratch, I am overly satisfied I was about to shell out 550$ to tmobile for a new one, but 399$..."
yes,yes,yes,"I own a tmobile samsung galaxy note 4. This phone offers great performance, connectivity, and, has a user changeable battery and user upgradeable memory via micro sd cards. I've bought Notes 2, 3, now 4."
yes,no,yes,"So far I have no problem with this phone. It gets the work done, although I expected more hours of use when fully charged but that is one of its short coming"
yes,yes,yes,"Was brand new in original box sealed all accessories were included worked right out of the box. Have had no problems with it at all, highly recommend great product and great sellers"
yes,yes,yes,My husband loves it
yes,yes,yes,I love the internal 32g and the external up to 32g mini sd card slot.
no,no,no,The only way to answer incoming calls when you are on the phone is to hang up on the next person. Very weird this is the first phone I have that I can't answer call waiting without hanging up on the other line
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone, seller was easy to work with and I am happy"
yes,yes,yes,"Great service, arrived promptly and multiple layers of packing ! Phone works great and unlocked as per the product detail !"
yes,yes,yes,"the phone came in nicely packed. the phone itself is really nice, even if its an older model. the only thing i didn't like was that there were way too many apps on it that were running, but this is coming from someone who had been using a blackberry z30 prior to this purchase."
yes,yes,yes,New out of the box plus a great price. I had the phone for about a week and had no problem yet.
no,no,no,the sim card reader stopped working after a week. at least the return went well
yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy note 4 is an awesome, capable, gorgeous phone. It can do so much. from business to gaming it covers it all. The screen is gorgeous......the CPU rocks and is fast. You can add storage space ( unlike the note5) I got mine for a killer price and I love it!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,Very nice design! Large screen is just awesome!
yes,yes,yes,Bought the phone at a great price! It works perfectly. Very happy with this purchase!
no,yes,no,"Item was sold and shipped by wireless experts inc., the phone was not for use in United States. The phone was intended for use in Asia, Europe & south America. Therefore when used in United States it did not operate properly."
yes,yes,yes,"Its a pocket computer with a phone app built in. Its got the BEST CAMERA you've ever seen. Ive been a feature Photographer for decades and its always about having your camera with you at all times. YUK !!! With this MARVEL, I have a kick-Ass camera with me AT ALL TIMES. Get one ..."
no,no,no,"I bought the phone back in April for $320; I received the phone in Chinese, I was able to change the language no problem; however, after the second month the screen was coming off ( yes, the glass on the screen was coming off ) , so ended up having piece of garbage."
no,yes,yes,"I ordered a ""New"" phone but instead I get one that is covered in scratches with no accessories. Unacceptable!"
no,no,no,"Bought mine from Verizon about six months after release. The backlight behind the Back button quit working about a month in, but Verizon replaced it quickly - unfortunately with a refurb that had a banged-up camera flash and a wonky earphone jack."
no,yes,no,Phone worked good. Had to return because could not recive a Sim card for it to get service.
no,yes,no,I will Never buy a phone online again! Didn't work at all! Took it to sprint and they got it to connect and i made 2 calls and phone died and the green error troll popped up and couldn't do anything. Wouldn't even turn on!
yes,yes,yes,Phones dies after 20% and won't cut back on unless charged more bit other than that it's fine
no,no,no,"My phone only lasted about a year before it suffered from non stop crashes and freezing. I sent it in to get repaired under warranty. The warranty process was simple, but it took nearly two weeks to get repaired and sent back to me. That is quite a bit of time to be without a working phone."
yes,yes,yes,Came fast and works perfect
yes,yes,yes,"Exactly what it was billed to be. New in box Note 4, great price."
yes,yes,yes,Nothing to be disappointed in~ a great buy for me!
yes,no,no,"I previously had a Galaxy 4. It was beyond broken. After some web surfing, decided I wanted a Note 4. I'd never order a phone offline before let alone a used one so I was a bit sceptical. Anyways, I Received my phone today. It looked brand new. Set up was also no problem whatsoever with Sprint."
yes,yes,yes,Wow! Thats all i can say. The phone was marked under used with some minor flaws. More like the phone looked brand new. Just need to get it activated tomorrow and i will send another review with that. Very happy with the product and the price.
yes,yes,yes,"Really like this phone. Fun and fast. Enjoy the bigger screen. It has more features and functions than I have used at this time, but will continue to master."
no,yes,yes,"The phone had been ""rooted"" according to the workers at Verizon. An hour and a half later, I was told that the phone had been intentionally tampered with, and would not be able to download apps."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a fantastic phone, don't regret this purchase on bit."
yes,yes,yes,"I really like this phone, it is quick and I can see everything on the bigger screen."
yes,yes,yes,"the phone was great, the one reason, I didn't give the phone five stars is because they send me the charger for an LG phone. other then that the phone a great!"
yes,yes,yes,Like new and a really good deal for the price. Better features and more user friendly than the Note 3 I had prior to.
yes,no,yes,"This is the phone I've been searching for. I have tried multiple smart phones over the years and even some iPhones. All of them had one problem or another. This phone, however, totally works for me."
no,no,no,Lasted 15 months and died suddenly
yes,yes,yes,its wasn't what I wanted sorry!!
no,yes,no,It gets very hot am freezes alot
yes,yes,yes,"Traded my Samsung Galaxy s4 for this phone. Best phone ever! I selected this phone over the IPhone 6 Plus. Do your research on the comparisons (e.g., price, functionality, productivity, etc.) Works as expected!"
no,no,no,"This is a great phone in the sense that it has multiple capabilities and is very user friendly. However, I hate it. It is the worst phone I have ever had, for example; my phone will be fully charged and an hour later, it will be at 60% with no usage on my part."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Great price. Pleasure doing business :)
yes,yes,yes,Great when I saw it. I think someone accidently tossed it in the move. I actually preferred it to the edge or other notes. I wish they could offer a discount on a freak situation like this
yes,yes,yes,"Ended up getting a note 3 instead, but still love it"
yes,yes,yes,Came as described. But missing a very important feature it should have!
yes,yes,yes,"Hands down the best phone in that generation. Of course, it has been replaced by the N5 and the N7 as the best phones on​ the market. But for most people, the N4 will fulfill all their needs."
yes,yes,yes,"Bought used item from atomic cellular and product meets expectations. Advertised as ""very good"" condition and it was. Very minor cosmetic blemishes and excellent working condition with decent battery life."
yes,yes,yes,"great product, nice picture and vivid screen."
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone. It's the second one in my household. There is really no downside to this phone. I even like it better than the Note 5. Fantastic choice if you don't want to pay $899 for the newest one and don't want to get stuck with a contract.
no,yes,yes,Bought one new and ended up turning it on just to find it continuously looping optimizing apps and shutting off and over and over. Read everywhere online and there are thousands of people with this same issue.
no,yes,no,After 2 months (ordered May 15th) we ordered 2 of these. they arrived brand new in the box. The camera will not focus on either phone and now both the wife's and mine have started freezing up and rebooting. I have taken them in to AT&T and they have nothing.
yes,yes,yes,"I recently got this phone and have been using it for a week and it works pretty well. It came in really clean and I only saw one tiny scratch but it wasn't really noticeable at all. I love my new phone and plus, I got it for a cheap price while it looked brand new!"
yes,yes,yes,"Purchased this phone in ""Very Good"" condition and it was exactly as described. Zero scratches and just one small little faded corner on the case from what appears to be wear from a case. Not noticeable whatsoever. Love my phone and the ease of this transaction!"
yes,yes,yes,Fine phone. As described. Easy to set up with my carrier.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great. Its fast, easy and fun."
no,no,no,Was Perfect for everyday use..... Then it died. This is the worst product ever. I demand a refund NOW.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone! I upgraded from a Galaxy S3 and you really get your bang for your buck at the lower price. I use my phone a lot and am loving the Note 4. While not the newest model out there, it still has great specs and performs great."
yes,yes,yes,Good Phone arrived as promised
no,no,no,False description.came with broken front camera
yes,yes,yes,All of the features are wonderful and easy to use
yes,yes,yes,Great phone for a great price
yes,yes,yes,"Still getting to know the phone, but so far so good!"
no,no,yes,Has a battery I can switch out.
yes,no,yes,"Love it! With prime, I received my phone the same day (for free). I've had it for a little over a month and have no complaints."
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone.
yes,yes,yes,the condition was incredible and the phone is everything I wanted it to be.
no,yes,no,DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. This is the only electronic device I've ever regretted purchasing. (And this one is a replacement!) The Bluetooth will just stop or give you grief connecting. The battery drops to 20% and the phone dies. Sometimes the camera makes the phone crash (or won't focus).
yes,yes,yes,I have used this phone for a few months now and at first I was a bit bothered by the size. Now I can't understand why I ever had a small phone! The screen shows a crisp and clear picture and the camera is by far the best I've ever experienced on a phone. I have not had any software issues yet.
yes,yes,yes,Phone was a great price! You couldn't even tell it was used. It was in perfect shape. Thank you!
yes,yes,yes,i love it!! thank you
no,no,yes,The phone itself is decent though with Lollipop the battery is much worse than my old Note 2 with Jellybean. For those using it Greenify does wonders for battery life. However I did not realize before buying it that there is no way to get permanent root access to the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"was in great shape, works good"
yes,yes,yes,"Came very fast and had no issues, love it!"
no,yes,no,Horrible battery life.. won't even last 2 hours
yes,yes,yes,"A great phone.... it's Awesome..... battery life Amazing !! Over all... phone is perfect, condition is like new."
yes,yes,yes,Perfect replacement for my water damaged phone. Came in excellent condition just as described. Price was great.
yes,yes,yes,Worth every dollar
yes,yes,yes,Works great and it came earlier than promised
yes,yes,yes,Phone was so scratched up that when I went to activate it. The lady laughed but hey u get your money's worth. But I'll give it 5 stars because internally the phone was good and it works great but justale sure if u are buying a use phone that they use the real pix of the phone so you can see how much...
yes,yes,yes,"Wonderful phone, with removeable back"
no,yes,no,Bought phone and it is defective. Says in the description great condition with barely any signs of use. It looks new but the phone wont work. Starts and turns off repeatedly non stop. Have yet to see the home screen. Do not recommend.
no,yes,yes,Hopefully we get 5.2 or something other than Lolliflop5.1 soon cuz I'm already ready to take the time and wait for an exchange so I can be back on kitkat4.4.... 5.1 full of bugs.
no,yes,no,Sim card problems right when I attempted to activate it. Had to drive to 5 different stores across Miami and none had a note 4 sim card which is 206R. I already had two but those didn't register. If this isn't fixed I will return for a refund.
yes,yes,yes,"Looks and works like new, I just switched from iphone and I will never look back. Pics are obviously higher resolution. The screen is huge. Expandable memory is awesome. Transferring files to and from Note are a breeze. No more iTunes to have to deal with. IR capable."
yes,yes,yes,Love It Thank you
yes,yes,yes,I love it. So far so good!
yes,yes,yes,"My handy LG G3 had passed on so I had to look for a new phone. I loved the large size of the G3 but I wanted something a little bit better. I could have went with the G4 but I wanted to see my other options. Yes, this phone model is a couple years old. But that did not turn me away."
yes,yes,yes,When the galaxy note 4 was released in 2014 my sister upgraded to a AT&T model from a galaxy S4 from the same carrier. She live in the USA and I'm living in Jamaica. She told me how impressed she were with the galaxy note 4 so much so that I fell in love with the device myself.
no,no,yes,"Takes 4 hours to charge! I cannot download any files or send any lengthy text messages. If the text messages is more than a few lines it will not send, I wasted my money I'm not happy with this phone."
yes,yes,yes,I have since upgraded to the Note 5 but we still use the note 4 for my granddaughter! ++A+A++A+A+A
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy Note 4, Charcoal Black 32GB"
no,no,no,"I return this order which was a AT&T and I could use it with my Carrier, there was nothing wrong whit the Phone."
yes,yes,yes,"best smartphone ever! and also the best deal on planet. Better than the newer generation phones! I did a lot research, and when i saw the screen, I was still amazed at the gorgeous screen. It is totally unbelievable. I was using galaxy s4 and the screen in note 4 is so much better."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is Making Samsung Great Again! I didn't keep it however I took it out to inspect the condition and see if I liked the note style phone. Looked great, operated fine, recognized sim card. attractive looking phone and was winning! I am defiantly getting the Note 6 when it comes out."
yes,no,yes,"I have had an iPhone 5 for over a year. While I loved the look and feel, I wasn't happy with the user experience. Before the iPhone I had an HTC One Mini and I liked the customization. It was endless. Going to the iPhone was a major step down in that department."
no,no,no,Bad battery sent with phone
yes,no,yes,"Sractches all over the phone and it didn't come with a charge or headphones, just the phone. Definitely not brand new don't recommend buying from this guy"
yes,yes,yes,Working just as expected
yes,yes,yes,OMG!!! I'm in love!!! This phone is fantastic. It came nearly 2 days ahead of schedual. I was worried about activating it but that went just as smooth as its operation. I couldn't be happier with the device. Overall BUY THIS PHONE!!!!
yes,yes,yes,good phone great deal...
yes,yes,yes,I bought this for my wife and she loves it! She promised me that she would not put it in the washing machine again. Expensive lesson learned.
yes,yes,yes,Nicely sealed package and good to have additional s pen tips!
yes,yes,yes,"Phone looks great and seems to work perfectly. I haven't had a single problem with the OS,etc. as of yet. However, I was told by my service provider that something activated a water exposure device inside of it. As a result, I had no choice but to pay for a monthly cell phone insurance plan."
yes,yes,yes,I was a little hesitant to purchase this phone. But once i received it i was happy . Open the box awsome condition just like new. Came with everything a new one would except headphones. But who cares i use my beats anywho.. Awsome phone would gladly purchase another one.
yes,yes,yes,"camera lens breaks too easily, wI'll be reselling this phone, it's not worth butting at all"
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely loved this phone. It is the only phone I didn't knit pick to death right away. I'll start with the obvious, the screen. By far the most gorgeous panel out there. The s-pen took no time at all to get used to,having multi-window capability was awesomely useful."
no,no,yes,"The phone itself is amazing, but the charger I received with my phone does not work at all."
yes,yes,yes,no issues with the phone so far.i got my phone within four days of being shipped which was pretty good.
yes,yes,yes,"After buying our (special needs and deaf) daughter 4 phones, she finally convinced us to get this Galaxy Note 4. Now she is in constant contact with her friends. I can't say enough about it."
yes,yes,yes,i like the features on the phone the only problem i had is the battery seems to overheat a lot and the charge doesnt last too long so i brought me an brand new battery which i dont mind doing cause i rather have an brand new battery anyways
yes,yes,yes,Great two layer hybrid case.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this phone used on here, I've had it a little over a week! So far works great. Only had a few small scratches on the screen. Very nice phone, I upgraded from the note 3."
yes,yes,yes,I like the note 4 and all work well for me.
no,yes,yes,"Don't get me wrong, the phone itself is a great product, but of your thinking of flashing it to boost mobile, you can't. Tried once I received the package, and they told me no."
no,no,no,Phone was in okay conditio. Was fine about It since i paid not that much but worse thing was speaker for phone was not working :( so every call i recieved that day thought i was hanging up on them..worst experience
no,no,no,Description said it was for sprint it actually from China telecome carrier. We tried to activate in our sprint plan and it wouldn't work.. very upsetting.especially when my fiance was excited about this phone. If I had a choice I wouldn't even rate this 1 star.
yes,yes,yes,"I am happy with this phone, even tho it's second hand, I haven't got to use it for long yet, cause I just got it, but first when I got it my hand and set it everything up... Oh man it's great handle. great color, big screen, easy to type. and more features. Best phone for very good money."

no,no,yes,Has a cracked screen
yes,yes,yes,"There's a tiny scratch across the top, but other than that it works great!"

yes,yes,yes,So far I love it great phone
yes,yes,yes,"Fits perfect, otterbox the best."
yes,yes,yes,The phone is beautiful and just what I wanted. All I had to do was take it to Verizon to have it activated - so easy. It was just as described.
yes,yes,yes,"I was a little nervous buying this online, but it came brand new in the box and worked great. Buy with confidence."
yes,yes,yes,Been using it for a couple of weeks. Not one problem! Works great. I am very satisfied.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I don't know what took me so long.

no,yes,yes,"Arrived without a scratch, but there are app icons burned into the screen. Only noticeable on white backlight but really annoying"
yes,yes,yes,"Love it. As listed, this gently used Samsung Galaxy Note 4 was in LIKE NEW cond. WooHoo ! Love it. Purchased it for the 16 pixel camera and the loud/crisp speakers when I listen to movies and Youtube music and it DID NOT disappoint. Only downsize is battery life."
yes,yes,yes,"It was listed as previously owned, however once it arrived it was BRAND NEW!!!!! i bought this phone for $200 bucks.....i was very happy!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,Love love love this phone
yes,yes,no,An outstanding purchase. One thing needs a operations manual that give more information than the get started sheet.
no,no,no,Phone came with a scratch on the screen. Disappointed in that
no,no,yes,Even though the phone looked and worked great. It would not activate under the sprint network even though it said sprint compatible.
yes,yes,yes,wife is very happy with her new phone
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome. The screen size of the phone made it comfortable to use so I wouldn't need my tablet every time I wanted to look at a videos or do a little reading in my spare time.
yes,yes,yes,I received a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Charcoal Black 32 GB it is just what they said it was an I am pleased with the Phone
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone. Easy to use and a remarkable camera.
no,no,no,Phone came and it was locked . I had to send it back
yes,yes,yes,So far so good; performs as advertised!
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Plenty of space. I have it for AT&T and tey do not have the Wi-Fi calling enabled. THat is my only complaint. I actualy ended up buying a total of three of these phones. Havings a Samsung TV, we use the screenshare a lot."
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect, works great, long battery life can use from sun up til sun down then pop it on the charger while i sleep and its good to go again ( actually can full charge from 20% to 100% in abut a hour or just over even on my usb unit in the truck when i wont be back as/when intended ) love using it for..."
yes,yes,yes,Very very very happy. The phone looked and works like new.
yes,yes,yes,Great. No complaints here!
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy, good price. My phone broke in an unexpected accident falling out of a moving vehicle to the ground into water puddle, and broke the screen and destroyed phone. I was able to be up and running with all my info apps and contacts within 2 days."
yes,yes,yes,This a tmobile phone not att
yes,yes,yes,Came in original box and packaging. Very pleased!
no,yes,no,This phone shuts off and then turns back on during a conversation. Once the battery is at about 20% there is about a 50/50 shot that the phone will cut off. If I try to turn it back on it just drains the battery to 0% depending on how many times I try to turn it back on.
no,yes,yes,Replaced my Note 3 with this Note 4 and glad I did. No longer does pressing the center button at the bottom take you to the Magazine which I never used. Pressing it takes you to the home screen and holding it down takes you to a Google search engine.
yes,yes,yes,Good phablet with enough RAM to keep me moving. I also like the removable battery and micro SD slot. Works well and is fast.
yes,yes,yes,No marks nor scratches on screen ... amazing
yes,yes,yes,Love it. Use the video and photo features more than anything else and I an totally happy with it.
yes,yes,yes,"GREAT PHONE, REPLACED A NOTE 3 THAT GOT BROKEN DUE TO MY FAULT. COMPANY PURCHASED FROM WAS GREAT TO DEAL WITH. 100%"
no,yes,no,It is what was described but shuts off when it gets down to 30% n will not come on until u connect it to a charger.
yes,yes,yes,"Arrived in great condition and was able to get it activated promptly in a Verizon store. I've had some very minor freezing issues, but otherwise everything works as expected."
yes,yes,yes,"I waited a considerable amount of time to write my review, due to the nature of my purchase. I can now honestly say that I am 100% satisfied!"
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect phone, like palm pilot? You will love this phone too,"
yes,yes,yes,"Purchased this as a replacement for a store bought Verizon Galaxy Note 4, which bricked after one and a half years of use. Decided to stay with the Note 4 until Samsung brings back at least the expandable storage (SD card slot) in future releases."
no,yes,yes,The phone if it worked properly is great. Its microphone doesn't work though. The other party can't hear me.
yes,yes,yes,The screen display (extremely vivid) is awesome! There is so much that can be done with this phone. It's a great tool for my busy life.
no,yes,no,I have only had the phone for 4 months. It does not show how many windows you have open. You have to click on the right of the button to see open windows. If you want to close the windows click to the left of the button. I use WIFI at the house to save on data.
yes,yes,yes,Fingerprint reader is useless. OK battery. A bit longer than note 3 and more awkward to hold. I would consider the note 3 over this. Also note 3 has better battery life.
no,no,yes,"I love this phone. The first new wall charger that came with the phone was defective, but the company immediately replaced it with a working wall charger and I am happy."
yes,yes,yes,Got this used and looks brand new out the box and works very snappy and fast!
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect! Came in exactly as advertised ""like new""! Only complaint would be the pen the tip just doesn't feel right, my recommendation would be edge cellular those guys know what they're selling!"
yes,yes,yes,Loooooove it! Bought it used had a lt of scratches on the rims. Description said it has few to none.
no,yes,no,"Ended up returning because it wouldn't keep a signal and dropped 2 out of 3 calls. I can't have that nor can anyone else. Other phones in the same spot didn't do that, so I know it was the phone. Tried to connect to different networks and it didn't help. Very disappointed. So much for Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,"Big fan of Samsung phones for sure. I have rarely had any issues with any of them. This phone is definitely the best one I've owned to date. I had the Note 2 previously. As an android customer, I love the fact that the battery is replaceable and I can feel free to add memory if needed."
yes,no,yes,Came in good condition and worked right on start up!
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone. However I do have a conflict between it being too large and too small. I like the largeness of it obviously for optical reasons of reading news and information. It is easier to read stuff and watch videos on.
no,no,no,The home button don't work and it doesn't say that in the description so I have to return it.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. This is the first Samsung that I have ever owned and would highly recommend that you try the Note out. I have used droids and iPhone platforms and would not use iPhone ever again.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is awesome. My complaint would be that the stylus does not work. It is damaged and needs to be replaced.
yes,yes,yes,"For a used phone it is in excellent condition. Everything seems to be working so for. I'm using straight talk sim card with this phone, I love it. I will order from this company in the future if anything goes well."
yes,yes,yes,The phone looks great but I never got a battery for it. I thought it came with one I guess I have to order one.
yes,yes,yes,now it seems small..otherwise ok
yes,yes,yes,I ordered this after looking into it extensively and love the product. I received it after almost three weeks from the date of order and I was totally enthused by it. I love it as an upgrade from the Samsung Note 2.
yes,yes,yes,Everything I expected it to be.
no,yes,yes,"Phone was received in condition described by Gizmotrader. Was very surprised to see it come bubble wrapped inside an envelope rather than a box but it seems to have been adequate protection. The phone came complete with s pen, no label nfc ready battery, and generic charger with cable."
no,yes,yes,Becuz it dies quick
yes,yes,yes,Phone is great but more chipped in the housing than expected. Delivered 3 hours early which was awesome and phone does work great so very thrilled
yes,yes,yes,I really like the Galaxy Note products. This is my third and I am not disappointed. The Note 4 is the best balanxe n of performance and price.
no,yes,no,I bought this phone to connect to my sprint line it had a bad esn not cool
yes,yes,yes,"Large, brilliant screen. Fun phone."
yes,yes,yes,This is a pretty nice phone. I've had it for just over a year now & today got the android marshmallow update... which is so far so good. The features that this phone has are great. I don't use half of them!
no,no,no,Product had bad ESN
yes,yes,yes,"Low Rom. I wanted 128 gb of Rom. Iow Ram , I wanted 4 gb of Ram. Or higher! 3.0 USB would be great. I enjoyed that on my Galaxy Note 3."
yes,no,yes,"I love my Samsung Galaxy Note 4 EXCEPT THE BATTERY. I'm thinking this is a problem with all Samsung phones. My son has the same phone and has the same problem. Previously to this Samsung phone, I had another Samsung phone and after about a year the battery seems to die."
yes,yes,yes,pretty decent for the price works like a charm
no,yes,yes,Its a T-mobile phone.. Purchased this phone 3 days ago.. doesn't allow access to 4g network
no,yes,no,"The phone was great, sent it back because it wasn't AT&T as advertised and not completely unlocked either. Still waiting on my return refund!"
no,no,no,Came broken. No audio or videos could be played and no calls could be made. Attempted to exchange and they never contacted me when another note 4 was in stock.
no,yes,yes,I was told it was a new phone the package never opened. I didn't get the headphones you normally would when you get a new phone.
yes,no,yes,Works grate and luv the price
yes,no,no,Only issue is my selfie front camera not working other than that phone performs perfectly
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. I love the bright, large, sharp display. Great sound. Like that it had a SD slot and removable battery, Those 2 features are missing on the Note 5 and was the key factors that lead me to consider the Note 4 instead."
yes,yes,yes,Purchased this from Wireless Plus Inc. It was just as desribed. Brand new sealed in a box. Love this phone and Wireless Plus Inc was great to work with. Highly recommended!
no,no,no,"Product had no camera lens. Also, phone stopped working!"
yes,yes,yes,"Let me say, I left team iphone and went to this phone. I must admitt I was skeptical about but glad I made the switch. I love that you can update the memory, something you can not do with the iphone. I wish my battery life was longer but I think it's because I stay on it all the time."
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. Just as described. No problem.
no,yes,yes,Counterfeit phone using a duplicate IMEI. Stay away.
yes,yes,yes,Very nice wife loves it
yes,yes,yes,it was as good as new without the box. very nice!
yes,yes,yes,The phone was really great at first but after 2 Weeks the mic goes and now I have to figure out what to do.
yes,no,no,Just got the phone i ordered and to find out this is Not a working! I will need my Money back . CHENIQUA
yes,yes,yes,Owned a couple of smart phones galaxy 2 Pantech discover and iPhone 4. The Galaxy 4 note is the best. Beautiful colors plenty of apps and fast processor. The 3 gig of ram and 32 gig storage are a bonus. Love the phone and highly recommend.
no,no,yes,The battery dies at 20%
yes,yes,yes,The phone works perfectly... I only regret buying the AT&T variant.
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone. It is just like new
yes,yes,yes,"I have this note Note 4 it has been perfect. It's a great phone. The best I have ever had but now it has become glitch that why I have gave it 5 stars I haven't drop the phone or gotten it wet.I paid too much for it too be acting this,way"
no,no,no,"Was from China. Not as advertised, could not be activated by Sprint. Totally disappointed, was a birthday present. Went through Sprint for a phone. Lost $10 on a glass screen protector installed before attempting to activate. Will never go down this road again."
yes,yes,no,Legit delivered as advertised. Seller has me a return customer product arrived early no complaints its legit.
yes,yes,yes,Im not to happy right now the battery dies so quickly im going to test it out another day and if this stays the same im returning this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Brand new looking. Works great.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone at a great price
yes,yes,yes,The phone is great and so are the features. The only problem I have with the phone is that it doesn't have Smart Rotation (where it reads your eyes to determine the orientation of the screen ie.
no,yes,yes,I was very disappointed in this product. I found it for a good price but when i tried to activate it I could not. I was sold a phone with a financial hold on it. You would think they would do a better job since they had such good reviews.
yes,yes,yes,Satisfied satisfied! I'm very happy with these guys! Perfect phone great deal!
yes,yes,yes,"I love, love, love this phone! Absolutely nothing wrong with it and NO visible wear/scratches."
yes,yes,yes,I chose this samsung galaxy note 4 taking into account the buyers' opinions. It perfectly matches my expectations.
yes,yes,yes,Looks just like new. I like that I can swap batteries and add memory to my phone. Excellent phone.
yes,yes,yes,nice looking phone but had defect in battery or power circuit. This was a refurb like new. I would stick with new devices if you can afford and find. the Note 4 is a great phone
yes,yes,yes,"Wonderful phone, my wife loves it, Simply swapping Sim cards from her previous phone brought it up on Verizon."
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone I've ever purchased. Been using it since it came out, it's fast and lasts forever. I could do without the silly pen, it serves no purpose. I don't see me needing a new phone until the note 7 comes out!"
no,yes,yes,big scratch on front
yes,yes,yes,Excellent smartphone!!!
no,yes,no,"I ordered a phone and it doesnt even work, it keeps rebooting for no reason."
no,no,yes,"There service is fast. Return the first Samsung Galaxy note 4 (at&t) due to screen burns because these phones must be on all the time at a particular display, only to received the replacement with screen burn."
yes,yes,yes,I'm happy with my purchase
yes,yes,yes,Great phone no cosmetic wear. Great price
no,yes,no,"I bought an ""like new"" phone that acts like one about to die. It freezes and loses network all the time, which was never an issue before."
no,yes,yes,This shouldn't even be a phone. Don't listen to your friend when they tell you to switch from an iPhone to this just so you can draw stupid stuff on snapchat with the stylus. I promise it's only fun for about 5 minutes.
yes,yes,yes,Hands down best phone I've used from an iPhone 5s
yes,yes,yes,"I'm in love with this phone really nice and neat, my kids love it for games too."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had 5 Smartphones over the years and this one is definitely the BEST one I have owned. The favorite feature is the Camera. Takes incredible pictures even in Low Light. The only other ""Cell Phone"" camera that takes as good of a picture is the Sony Xpheria Z3."
yes,yes,yes,Very impressed with the quality of the phone! Husband is very happy with it. It was his Christmas present from me.
yes,yes,yes,"This is my 2nd phone I have ordered from this pangea deals. Phone was actually better than described, very pleased and will order from them when I'm ready to upgrade again."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent condition. Couldn't be happier.
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I've ever had.
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone I've ever owned, if you like android samsung is the way to go!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I pove the S pen, hands down the best feature, but also the only reason why I would consider buying a samsung device again. I love the large screen and the functions are really nice. But the phone performs very sluggish. Lags with switching of apps and running of certain programs."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone great battery life
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Works amazing.
yes,yes,yes,"Purchased as a used and if not aware of that, I would have assumed to be new. It did however come packaged with a white stylus."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone came exactly as pictured, looks great in white, and is a marked upgrade over my poor, now-defunct Razr Maxx."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone so much. I can do everything on it. I have had it for several months and have had no problem at all.
yes,yes,yes,The phone meets my expectation. Good battery life and the wind screen that allows me to work as I go.
yes,yes,yes,"Love the Note 4, I purchased it to replace my original Note1, nice upgrade, very satisfied with purchase. NO problems at all!"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a great phone. I really love the camera and the stylus. I have not had many problems. The only problem I had was with the battery, it would not hold a charge, but they seller sent me a new battery and it works great! I have taken many photos and they all turned out great."
yes,yes,yes,Pros: This is an amazing device and is a quick and reliable phone. Cons: The device starts to slow down over the time. The Bottom Line: This device does everything other devices and in my opinion a little better.
yes,yes,yes,"I am happy with this purchase. It came in good packing, and looked flawless. I have an otterbox case as the phone is big,and thus prone to damage during falls. It's been almost a month, and there are no issues with this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Great price. The condition was excellent and it works perfect. I have owned all of the notes 2,3,5,4. I like the 2 and 4 the best. I returned the note 5 after I used the camera it took grainy pics, and it had horrible video playback.. This note 4 is just an awesome phone. I am very pleased."
no,no,no,"The worst note I have ever owned and I had the 1, 2 and 3 versions. The GPS does not work, the email is not consistent, the battery doesn't work consistently, the phone freezes and locks often. I am so disappointed."
no,yes,yes,This phone has a lot of positives including a great screen and a great camera but let down by poor GPS. I tried it several times under a clear sky and the location it gave was more than 50 meters off.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. It is light and thin, and just the right size. My battery routinely lasts longer than a day with regular daily use (mostly reddit throughout the day). The S-pen is very accurate, though personally I do not use the note taking functions much."
yes,yes,yes,"Received item as described ,very happy with it"
yes,yes,yes,I appreciate a new phone at a low price but the phone does at 15%.
yes,yes,yes,Works Great And Like new. Love it
yes,yes,yes,"Better than my new Galaxy S 5, EZ to use & good used prices, mine cost 274.00 Best to buy phones this way. Plan to next phone Note 5 later Used."
yes,yes,yes,"I had this phone for 8 wonderful weeks before the Android 5.0 upgrade was forced upon me by Verizon. That upgrade took it from ample battery life to make it all day with plenty of margin to dead by 6pm. Oh, and let's not forget the horrendous lag."
yes,yes,yes,"Slightly hesitant about buying a phone from here. Especially seeing how cheap it was. But I've had the phone for a week and seems to be working perfectly. Works as if brand new. Edges show some wear, but that's what the case is for. Overall, great phone for a great price."
yes,yes,yes,"Having more issues with this phone than what it's worth. No apps are ever working correctly on it. It wants to reply to emails whenever it wants to, I would say it was just this phone, but this is the second one I have had as the first one basically blew up and Samsung had to replace it."
no,yes,yes,Just got my galaxy note 4 and the camera is cracked! Will change this when they fix this problem. UPDATE Great phone once they sent on that worked. Still have it
yes,yes,yes,I Got just what I wanted thanks
yes,yes,yes,Fun to use and the cases that come with it are just amazing. If you enjoy long battery life and debating if you want this or the note 5 I say this is way better at battery life.
no,yes,no,Was good for a few days. Then started constantly power cycling. The blue light stayed on during the power cycling. The S Pen was crackly like an old leaf. I tried to use it and it broke. It was extremely fragile.
yes,yes,yes,"Very nice phone, in great shape, had a small issue with the battery and the dealer was very quick to take care of it for me. I will definitely be referring them to my friends"
yes,yes,yes,Best Phone I've EVER Owned!!!
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone, does what I need."
no,yes,yes,"I was a little ladleary about purchasing this phone but it is perfect nothing wrong with it. SPRINT was able to activate it with no problem. The only issue I'm having which is a non issue is that i keep getting this invalud sim card notification asking me to ""Power cycle"" my phone whatever that..."
no,yes,yes,"When I first got this phone, it worked perfectly fine. After about a week or so I noticed random vibrating in the phone. I later realized that when the camera is focusing, it makes this vibrating, making the pictures come out blurry since sometimes, it doesn't stop!"
yes,yes,no,"Note 4 is the Standard! Got my wife one, moved her away from a D Maxx that went defective. We wanted to go to Note 7's but procrastinated, & glad we did. Awaiting for the Sam. Note 8's. We'll now stay with the same model phones. Any future upgrades, we'll keep the Note 4's for backup phones."
no,yes,no,The note 4 I was advertised as new but I think it was used the battery doesn't last long at all compared to my other Note 4 which went bad but the phone is working good
no,no,no,"Will be returning in the morning, product did come professionally packed, included was an htc charger?!? New but generic cable, however I dont know what's wrong with the phone but it wont turn on, I can hear sound but I can't hear anything?? Hope that I can receive a replacement/refund"
yes,yes,no,"I bought this phone when I was eligible for an upgrade in April 2015 (it's now Oct 2016). When I first started using it, I missed my old phone - the Note 2. Although I can't remember exactly why because I've grown accustomed to this phone now, I did almost consider returning the Note 4 and just..."
yes,yes,yes,"Note 4 came in good condition, a few little scratches or dents no big deal, but it when i went to sprint they had some issues setting up, they did get it working though. The phone works calling, wifi and network works all good but sometimes when calling someone it wont call it will just say dialing..."
yes,yes,yes,This note 4 meets all my expectations and more. I'm still learning more about this phone and loving it.
yes,yes,yes,Phone looked brand new.
no,yes,no,Camera doesn't work unless phone is charging
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone!
yes,yes,yes,Very pleased with the phone. Works like new. Looks like new. Even the battery holds charge well. Very pleased.
yes,yes,yes,My first Note 4 was really starting to act up so I purchased this one. I love the Note 4 and this one was purchased new and it is working perfectly. Great price. Replaceable battery and expandable memory are something I insist on.
no,yes,yes,Battery was defective would have been really easy to put that in the items description.
no,yes,no,I was expecting the phone is new BUT NO..they did factory reset to looks new.The phone is automatically die when the battery shown 20% percent. I am really disappointed.
yes,yes,yes,"Love it, much less expensive. I had water damage, purchased this as a replacement used my sim card. Happiness!"
no,yes,yes,Great phone but it was randomly shutting off. Battery wouldn't hold a charge. Had to return it
yes,yes,yes,"First off, I've only had this phone for about eight hours. Will update if anything negative happens... The phone and screen are in great shape, but upon opening the case I saw that the battery was kind of beat up looking with some black smudges on it."
yes,yes,yes,The phone was in great condition.
no,no,yes,"I read every review before convincing myself to order this phone. All three phones that Verizon gave to me, were electrical problems...Its been nutz...so they told me I could not replace it again....SO I was forced to find another solution...I looked at ever phone on this site..."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone worked, and I love it."
no,yes,no,Speakers don't work very well. Returned and ordered the note 5. I'm hoping for better luck..
no,yes,yes,"I got the phone and it's so pretty and nice looking, however it turns off on its own and gets super hot when I am using it. I am very disappointed! I am sending it back."
yes,yes,yes,Arrived in new Condition. The red cell is great!!!
no,yes,yes,"The product came when expected, however, after checking it out to see if anything was wrong with it. I happened to find that there was debris in the back camera lens between the protective glass shield and the lens itself. It is noticeable when taking pictures."
yes,yes,yes,Best Samsung Note.
no,no,no,"BUYER BEWARE Recived with screen separating from frame and after checking device with my carrier I found this item was referbished. I bought this product as new and it was sold to me as ""New"". Very disappointed"
yes,yes,yes,"Efficient, Swift-moving, great battery life. I love using the S Pen. I usually have many apps open at one time and no lag."
no,yes,no,I bought this used and for some reason it won't charge. I thought it was a the cord but it's the phone itself. I did really like this phone when I got it but since it won't charge it's pretty much pointless and a waste of money.
yes,yes,yes,Son loves it! Especially since he loses EVERYTHING & this phone notifies you if you are away from the stylus =)
yes,yes,yes,It provides me with everything that I could ask for from a phone with prices that I can work with! No need to go and grab a Note 7 and brag about how that phone can take photos in the dark. Other than the pen and camera improvement...
yes,yes,yes,"So far this phone has been great! A couple of minor problems but overall light years better than my old phone, an LGG2 which gave me problems from day one and was such a pain to deal with for two years! I'm praying that this Note 4 will continue to work as well as it is now :) l highly recommend it!"
no,yes,yes,"Let me start with the fact that I use to love my phone. Then it was out of warranty, and it still worked fine. Until Samsung sent a software update that I cannot remove. Now I HATE THIS PHONE. DO NOT BUY unless you're ok with your phone restarting during meetings!!"
yes,yes,yes,Very fast and fitting for someone who enjoys multitasking and amazing video quality
yes,yes,yes,Finally a provider who sells what they say they do.pirfect condition works great. Thank you love the phone.
no,yes,no,"When I first received the phone it was in great condition, but just as the warranty went off it started to freeze up ,blinking out !"
no,yes,yes,"The Phone is fine it's the battery that's junk. The Phone onlyvstays on when plugged in, it shuts off after unplugged. Have a new battery in the way."
yes,yes,yes,"Left IOS 10. Came back to Android. I love this phone. Beautiful bright screen. Fast response. Large screen. Not heavy, or awkward. Fits in smaller crossbody purses. Cannot complain about this one."
no,yes,no,I would like a Full Refund because this phone can only be used on speaker
yes,no,yes,All around i thought it was a pretty good phone but as soon as about 5 min the battery died i had it charged to 75% then boom 0% sot ill order a new battery and it its all good after that ill be happy.
yes,yes,yes,First one I bought the phone did not work for calling. The second one I bought was better but never got a great signal or GPS strength. Was told it was because it's a older phone and can not support the newer updates. Wish I had now before spending the money.
yes,yes,yes,phone was nice had signs of being inside an otter box its whole life worked very well
yes,yes,yes,"Still use it daily. I almost upgraded to the Note 7, but....."
no,yes,no,Phone does not charge. Charging port is damaged
yes,yes,yes,Was just what I was looking for in every aspect!
yes,yes,yes,Better than the 5 in my opinion.
yes,yes,yes,"Had been using a feature-phone from 95+/- til 2014. Got a used smart-phone in 2014, (early Samsung; circa 2009), and used it till it ""Bricked"" itself in 2016. Getting current with the modern and matured Android equipment was a treat."
yes,yes,yes,I will review for my has band. He loves it. Tablet huge for gaming.
yes,yes,yes,"The best note device before the note 7...and now it's the best note device again. I loved this phone, the same pen is great, removable batteryou, SD card... awesome amoled screen, did I say the screen is awesome!!!"
yes,yes,yes,cellphone works fine but I select a new when I place my order and I get a used one.
no,no,no,bad phone wrong phone and bad bettery
no,yes,yes,So this phone is functional. IT does NOT come with any other the listed accessories. ALSO the screenext is cracked and so is the photo lense.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is great, I'm very upset I didn't get the s-pen. Its kind of a big deal!"
yes,yes,yes,Very good phone for the price.
no,yes,yes,If they had a zero star that's what I would have gave this phone. I had ordered this phone which suppose to be brand new. When I turned it on it immediately blacked out. I had plugged it up and it came back on. The phone had kept blacking out even when the battery was at 98%.
no,no,no,"These AT&T Note 4's are still stuck on Android 5.1.1, with no way to update them (locked boot loader). This is despite the hardware being plenty good enough to run a newer version of Android."
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone!! Thank you
yes,yes,yes,Exactly what was advertised!
yes,yes,yes,"Of course this phone is gorgeous, takes beautiful pics and has a LOT of functionality. HOWEVER, IF I could trade this for another phone I would. I CONTINUE to have issues with the phone ""resetting"" itself OVER AND OVER AGAIN and have had other issues."
no,yes,yes,RIP OFF!!! Do not buy this phone. It is advertised as new but when it came it has very visible signs of wear and gunk in the crevices and holes. It isn't even a used phone in good condition. Junk.
no,yes,yes,"Unfortunately, I have had nothing but problems with this phone. The phone worked great for the 1st 45 days and then soon after that my phone was shutting off at 30% battery level. I purchased a replacement battery and that solved this issue."
no,yes,no,"Because of the nature of my work, I use this phone rather heavily all day, mostly on WiFi. I manage a busy manufacturing facility, and constantly sending emails from the shop floor, taking pictures of incoming stock and final product, texting colleagues that are out of the shop."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! Only one knock on the bottom left corner but I leave a case on my phone so it's covered up. Screen is in great shape. It's a great price for such a nice phone! I couldn't be happier with this purchase!
yes,yes,yes,"All good. Phone was as expected. Packaged well, arrived as scheduled. No problems."
no,yes,no,I was hesitant to buy this because I had heard that it didn't work consistently.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this to replace a 2 year old Galaxy Note 2. It seems a LOT faster than my Note 2, and has some exceptional features that the Note 2 did not have, like being able to block callers. I've had two problems, however."
no,no,no,Bad charging port Battery does not keep a full charge
yes,yes,yes,"I previous had one before upgrading to the bomber Note 7 Since the recall, I decided to go back to the Note 4 until they figuire out the new one. I had already sold my old note 4 so needed to find another."
no,yes,no,Because I have to choose a star but this phone sucks. It was no only dirty but power cycles once the battery is low. The camera has a white fog and if you take more then a few pics at once it power cycles. Save you cash.
no,no,yes,It was okay but I had to buy another battery because the phone kept turning off
no,yes,yes,The condition of cell was as claimed about the cell.
yes,yes,yes,I really love this phone! I originally purchased one through my wireless provider. On a trip to the lake 3 months later it ended up at the bottom of a lake. :( So this was a perfect replacement.
yes,yes,yes,Phone was in amazing condition and had zero blemishes or defects. No problem activating with my account. Seller will definitely be on my preferred list going forward!
no,no,no,Phone broke after only 3 months of use. Most expensive door stop ever purchased. I'm a very unhappy customer.
no,no,no,bought it used. (5stars after the 3rd phone received due to not matching description) lost a star due to not matching description. and loosing another star due to it no longer working. does not recognize sim card or sd card. took it to get repaired. replaced sim card slot and no difference.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is the best I've owned sofar and is possible the last of replacable battery units because I hold on to phones to long. The only downside but is not due to the phone its-self but all the terrible software updates that either don't work right and/or take away nice features that somehow the...
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with the phone. Replaceable battery, great screen, perfect for working on the go."
yes,yes,yes,Nothing can beat a Note ever Samsung go back to that and redraw over the same concept don't try to imitate the competitor ( I phone )
yes,yes,yes,"The case is durable and not too bulky. I did not realize that the plastic screen cover was not included, but otherwise a nice case."
yes,yes,yes,Love everything about this phone The size is just what I wanted
no,yes,yes,Phone works grate but headphone jack dose not work.
yes,yes,yes,"It's was really cool phone... when it doesn't brick itself into a bootloop from ""optimizing"" applications. I suppose if I was quick enough to turn off any and all autoupdates it might be a good phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone actually looks fantastic even though it was only listed as ""good"" condition. Very pleased, and so far it works well, too. My only gripe is the battery is poor. Drains quickly with minimal use (50% in less than 2 hours) but I guess that's to be expected with a used phone."
yes,no,yes,"So receiving the product was definitely an interesting experience. I didn't receive the Note 4 but rather the Note 5 although (no complaints here). The phone had no blemishes, worked perfectly with both S Pen and included Charger. The interface of the phone was definitely no short of amazing."
no,yes,no,"This is the 2nd day using the phone. It will not hold a charge for more than 2 hours. It was a NEW PHONE purchase. I wrote seller, waiting to see what they do.... I have everything turned off from running in the background while it is on and it still is dead in less than 2 hours...."
yes,yes,yes,"I can't afford new phones, so have to buy the old version's but they are still great!"
yes,yes,yes,Great used phone. Works just perfectly. Disapoint ed with the packaging though. The phone was loose and rolling around in a too big box
yes,yes,yes,"Overall a great purchase. Phone activated as should. Only negative, theres screen burn in from the status bar after upgrading to marshmallow. Pretty annoying when watching videos. Exchange worthy I hope?"
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone in the galaxy series of notes. I love it. Nice size, graphics, and operational features. Very user friendly."
no,yes,yes,I LOVE the PHONE However it did not even make it 6 months. It arrived with some cosmetic defects. No worries it worked fine. Then slowly over time it started having issues and then one day it just would not turn on past the red verizon wireless screen. :( I had to get a new phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Needing a quick replacement for my dinosaur, I worked with friends who have been very pleased with their Note 4. The Note 4 has been very easy to transition without any large learning curve."

yes,yes,yes,"Love my phone, a lot of memory and very dependable and I love the stylus, I can imagine how good the latest model phone could be but way too expensive for a phone so this one will have to do. overall I love this phone"
no,yes,no,Phone did not come with the sim card needed and the charger they sent me did not even match the phone! Phone shuts off for no reason. Huge waste of my money
no,yes,no,"I received the phone on time but when I try to charge it, IT IS HORRIBLE! I have now been charging it since this morning and it is only at 10%. What is the point of having a cell phone and having to leave it at home so I ca HOPE it charges. :( The battery drains quickly as well."
no,yes,no,"Phone is fine but in less than a week the battery sucks....

yes,yes,yes,This is an excellant product

yes,yes,yes,I got my phone within 2 days it cane with everything it was supposed to come with. They say possible light scratches but my phone had none. A little wear and tear around the charging port but that's about it. On a scale of 1-10 this is a 10 for a used phone.

no,no,no,"I loved my Note 3, so I thought an upgrade would be great. NOPE. Typing on the keyboard is messed up and it skips letters. Camera auto-focus doesn't work and tap to focus barely works. The unremovable Facebook app constantly crashes and causes the phone to reset and freeze."
no,no,no,Phone was turn off by itself
yes,no,yes,So many features om such a small device. I can also see my blood O2 level which comes in handy when I'm flying at high altitudes. Soon we'll be able to see most of out body readings like the Tri-corder on Star Trek.

yes,yes,yes,"Four star's for my note 4, it is great. It took me forever to save up for it though."

yes,yes,yes,"I bought this for my mom to upgrade her from a Note 2. I also own a Note 4 so I knew she liked everything about it. This was a great purchase, It is what it says it is. The phone is branded with AT&T and that is the carrier my mom has so I just took her sim card from the Note 2 and put it in the..."

yes,yes,yes,The best smartphone I have owned. Have only a couple small problems with it but no phone is perfect. Would recommend to anyone.
yes,yes,yes,"This was to replace my previous Note 4, so far so good everything works well. Came with dead battery, luckily I had a charged battery on hands so that Sprint could activate service on it"
yes,yes,yes,I have had 2 note 2 phones and this one does not disappoint either.

no,no,yes,Sprint could not activate it as it is still active on someone elses account. Can uou fix that?
yes,yes,yes,The phone is impressive and I honestly love it already. It functions way beyond my expectations. My only gripe is the battery. For whatever reason right at 15% the phone just shuts off. Nothing but black until I plug it back in. Not sure if the battery is shot as I purchased a previously used phone.
yes,yes,yes,"What can I say, great phone and price"
yes,yes,yes,"My husband absolutely loves this phone. Even though it's an older model it does what he needs it to do and it's the one he wanted. Plus, you get the system updates so it's like having a newer model. The pen on it makes it convenient to sign documents and to write memos."

no,no,no,don't buy from this company. My phone didn't last a year. I contacted them with my issues good luck calling them their voice mailbox is full and they don't return calls and email they only replies I feel like it. All they told me to deal with my broken phone number to contact Samsung.

yes,yes,yes,"Gift for daughter's first phone, she LOVES it!"
no,no,no,"Battery lasted 2 days. I had to order a new battery to even get it to boot. *update* After letting the new battery go dead, I charged it to 100%, unplugged the phone and it won't boot. Returning, will try another one."

yes,yes,yes,Phone looked like new. Very happy so far.
yes,yes,yes,"I have loved this phone! I am still depressed that I accidentally murdered it recently. Apparently, the dark...the toilet...phone...and myself brushing my teeth in the dark do not go together. Out of all the phones that I have ever had the Notes by Samsung are my absolute favourite."
yes,yes,yes,It's freakin' awesome. Camera instantly takes clear and crisp pictures. Much improved over the Note 2.
yes,yes,no,We I don't get 4g lte in my area for this phone do not recommend you buy this...

yes,yes,yes,"I loved my Note 4!! I've recently upgraded to Note 7 and am definitely missing my battery life of the N4. This phone is durable, long lasting, it does has microSD slot, S pen feature, no lag. It was a great phone. Even strong enough to last through my 4yr olds torture. Haha."
yes,yes,yes,LOVE this phone!!!
yes,yes,yes,11/28/2016 So far no issues. Product was advertised as new but was previously registered to someones sprint account already. Other then that I am enjoying the phone so far.
yes,no,yes,"Have had Samsung phones now for a couple of years, previously owned HTC devices. Love the S-Pen, and the fact it has removable battery and a microSD slot. The 32GB standard memory is great too, all my previous devices had 16GB (or less)."

yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Love the stylist
no,yes,yes,The cord broke where you plug into the phone
yes,yes,yes,I’m pretty glad I have it on there! I definitely recommend!
yes,yes,yes,"Phone looks practical new to me. It activated without any problems, Thank you edge cellular!! I do recommend going on eBay and get the sim card for it , Sprint stores doesn't carry micro sim anymore ."
yes,yes,yes,Phone Had A Scratch On Screen Other Than That All Is good
yes,yes,yes,"i like using my phones without any cases, the chamfered edges on the note 4 are just to fragile. hopefully with the note 5, Samsung address this issue."

yes,yes,yes,I love my new note 4!
yes,yes,yes,"This is a gorgeous phone. I knew I wanted an android phone, and in my mind Samsungs are the best. It was just the matter of settling on the model. I gleaned information from tech reviews online, and chose this model. Why?"
no,yes,yes,Much cheaper than what I would have paid with sprint. I did not have any problems getting it activated at the sprint store and I love this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"What's NOT to like? It's fast, big, and does everything I need! I love being able to carry a second battery, if needed."

yes,yes,yes,i bought this for my sis and she loves it
yes,yes,yes,"Have had this bad boy for a while now, still people stare and say ""wow, that's big!"" I nod my head with a knowing smile and a flirting eyes I reply, ""I know, thanks."" I have fairly large hands, I've been lead to believe."
yes,yes,yes,I love it. Does a super job for me.
no,no,no,very clumsy cover with plastic all over. S pen is a complete joke. It is a hit and miss when it works. camera quality is a bit better than IPhone3. Low light camera is at the worst quality.
yes,yes,yes,Replacing Galaxy S4. Very pleased with the upgrade.
yes,yes,yes,Overall a great phone
no,no,yes,will i be able to use this ph with page plus and keep my existing #?
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has all the options and features I wish I had on this laptop. Good size, pen feature, compatible with all my other devices and is tough. I bought it for a second time after swimming with my first one.... no it doesn't float!"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone itself is pretty awesome, but the battery may need to be replace from my experience from using Samsung. The battery can become defective for no apparent reason and usually a new battery swap is the answer. Of course I meant to say after a year or so... Then you need to get a replacement."
yes,yes,yes,Easy process to buy. It seems to be a great phone so far. Have not found anything that I don't like with it.
no,yes,yes,"I have this phone because it was one of the phones OK'd by my company. I bought it through Verizon. It has enterprise level security features that passes my company's security rules, such as phone encryption among other things. Once this phone is encrypted, it is painful to use."
yes,yes,yes,Best smartphone that I ever had. Even compared to the new note 5 this is the one to get. Love the removable battery and also the removable SD card. The Samsung phones take the best pictures by far.
yes,yes,yes,"This is an amazing phone I love it. I had to pay full price for an upgrade because I am grandfathered in on the Verizon unlimited data plan and they wanted to make me sign a new contract for a new phone with would have gotten rid of my data and set me on a limited plan, and I told them I would..."
no,yes,no,"I would ha e loved this phone if it didn't shut off all the time by itself. I have always had it in the case since the day I got it, and it just shuts off. Couldn't send it back because it was the only phone i had due to my iphone being on the frits."
yes,yes,yes,"So after doing a lot of research online for the best phablet I bought the note 4. The phone has a great screen, however on paper it looks fast, but in reality it slows down a lot, it lags, specially during gaming or even opening contacts or messaging app."
yes,yes,yes,Outstanding deal and service. Phone looked better than advertised
yes,yes,yes,"They said it was fairly new, but it looks like it was never used. The phone itself is really good too"
no,yes,no,"Unfortunately it had to be returned because the sm card was not clean and the service provider was unable to activate phone service. Very disappointing, you would expect that these devices would be throughly checked out before selling to customers . So I am unable to rate."
no,no,no,"I can even used it now because u posted it has unlock phone but it would lock I don,t know what to do with or may be I will return and send me back unlock phone thank I will appreciate for feed back"
no,yes,no,"This is the second phone from the same company and both have been faulty. The ""like new"" one cost more and was cosmetically damaged with chips and scratches. Don't trust the descriptions."
no,yes,no,"Phone is defective and unable to return it because I traveled after purchase. Thought maybe it just came with a bad battery or charger. I replaced both, after taking it to someone I found out the problem was with the phone the whole time. Waste of a bunch of money when they said the phone was new."
yes,no,yes,Although i love the note 4 i received.....the battery is going from full charge to 0 and then completely shutting off. Not sure if this is a phone issue or a battery issue. I will give it a few days....hopefully purchase a new battery and it fixes itself. Update. The new battery did not work.
yes,no,yes,"I bought the samsung note 4 because i loved the note 3. This device has amazing graphics and great stereo sound. I have used iphones, lg's, htc m9 and note 3. Samsung, as a whole, far surpassed all the other devices in speed,design and function."
yes,yes,yes,"So from the beginning of time when the note first came out I was right there waiting in line to grab it. They all exceeded my expectations. Pros-excellent picture taking, Android apps are the best!"
yes,yes,yes,So far so good no issues at all
yes,yes,yes,Does What I want It To. Primarily interested in email and Facebook. Plus some search capabilities.
no,no,no,- All around slow to complete tasks - Overall bad mobile signal strength even when my other old Evo 4G LTE phone has good signal and I work in several large cities. - Not able to use Hotspot unless very strong LTE signal even when my old Evo 4G LTE phone 
yes,yes,yes,Great phone best price
yes,yes,yes,"I like what this phone can do, and the many different options there are to customize it, the camera is amazing!!"
yes,yes,yes,"So far I'm loving the phone. So many features, I'm still discovering all the nuances. Wonderful, big HD display, terrific speaker sound, and lots of memory for files and tunes."
yes,no,yes,"First off the size may scare some people, but being a 5' 3.5"" girl with average sized hands I find it actually perfectly fine after playing around by using the side panel and other one-handed operation rather than my old small iPhone 4."
yes,no,yes,The sound quality from the speaker phone and wireless headset is not very good.
yes,yes,yes,It is working well as advertised.
yes,yes,yes,Was packaged good nice phone works well minimal scratches always liked the note four would repeat purchase in the future.
yes,yes,yes,I would suggest a phone from this company any day now. What a great phone.
yes,yes,yes,Think I wrote the wrong item excellent job guys finally being a owner of a note 4 excellent condition still figuring how to do my alarm clock. ... but finally being an owner of this good phone very clear video quality a must have
yes,yes,yes,The phone was in great shape and at a great price.
no,no,yes,Said it was Sprint not Sprint.
yes,yes,yes,It was what I expected!!!...
no,no,no,Disappointed back cover doesn't stay on can't put a case on it
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone for about 6 months and have had ample time to test it's features and explore what it has to offer (good & bad). Overall it is a fantastic phone and a perfect show of how far technology has come. I'll highlight just a few of my favorite functions and list pros & cons for each.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone will be relevant for many years to come. Even with the new phones, this phone will still outshine them. In terms of specs and battery life."
no,yes,yes,Very buggy... I have had it for 3 months and have about had enough.
yes,yes,yes,Can be a little buggy but to be expected buying an older used phone
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Looked like new and works flawlessly. Very pleased. Thanks!
no,no,no,Product didn't work correctly had to send in for repair. Would not get 4g network
yes,yes,yes,"Great product, great price"
yes,yes,yes,"Have enjoyed my note 4 just like I did my galaxy s3! I may not use as many features as some but I have enjoyed all those I do use. Watching movies, taking picures, notes, calendar, many apps....it's my baby!"
yes,yes,yes,It's big and it's the best phone I have ever had I'm a big guy so the size fits me great if you have smaller hands it can be a little hard but that's not me so no knock there
yes,yes,yes,It's ok a little bored with it now
yes,yes,yes,The phone was in great condition as used...it works well but the touch screen sometimes doesnt work. But I think I got a good deal.
no,yes,yes,I wasn't able to activate was looked
no,yes,no,The phone broken down after 6 months. I called their service line but they say there was nothing that they can do.
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from the Galaxy S3 to the note, due to the praise one of my coworkers gave theirs. I am completely satisfied with the upgrade. The product came in fine working order, I just did not realize that for the 1st time, I would need a SIM card. Once that was remedied I have zero complaints."
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy Note 4 is my current phone. I switched from the galaxy S5 which by the way is my favorite phone I have ever owned. The Note 4 is a great phone don't mistake that, but compared to the S5 it falls short in many ways. The first being durability."
no,no,yes,At first this device was good but that lasted only for about 2 or 3 months. After that everything went down hill. The phone starting to glitch it does not work smoothly any more and it is not like I am asking the phone to do anything hard too.
yes,yes,yes,"Love, love, love this phone! !! Prefect sized screen, great pictures, fast service, it's just simply amazing?!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I'm so glad I got this phone!!!! The sylus is amazing! the phone does SO MUCH!!!! Maybe my LG before this was SO TERRIBLE that this phone is like heaven, but I LOVE IT!"
yes,yes,yes,"When the Note 5 came out, I got this phone.....it's basically the note 5 with exception of removable battery and SD card....Best phone out there"
yes,yes,yes,"I've owned one of these for going on 2 years now. Very fast, large display, and the pen makes it a more usefull device than anything else on the market."
yes,yes,yes,A great current gen phone for the price. Display is vibrant and is the star of the show. Built in IR blaster was a nice surprise and can control nearly any IR input device including my AC and my HDMI 5 port switch.
yes,yes,yes,Bought for girlfriend -- she loves this phone/tablet. Phone calls are clear and response is very good.
yes,yes,yes,"I am actually really impressed with this device. I was worried hearing the reviews about it working horribly with the lollypop update, but i have had it over a month and have had no problems besides one. My only problem is the amount of bloatware."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone after owning a Galaxy S4, and loving it for two years. I fully expected to buy the S6, but after learning there was no micro sd slot and the battery was not removable I skipped it and went to the Note. If I wanted an Apple product I would buy and Iphone!"
yes,yes,yes,I am annoyed by the constant updates. So far I am satisfied by the battery life and fast charging.
yes,yes,yes,very nice.I love the phone so much
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone and battery life. Have not charged the phone for 48 hours and still has 36% battery left.
yes,yes,yes,Looks brand new. No scrathes or anything. Fast and takes awesome pictures.
yes,yes,yes,"LOVE IT!!!! Love the white, the screen size is amazing. I don't find it difficult to use it as a phone being larger since it's so light."
yes,yes,yes,Not So Great. Got this phone about 2weeks ago and have had several issues Pros: -Big Screen -Camera takes great pictures -Lighter than other phones the same size -Great health features built in -Widgets are neat -Location based features are great Cons -As soon as I put a few apps on the device it...
yes,yes,yes,Phone is in good condition.
yes,yes,yes,Better than described. Bought this under used/very good category and it's used/excellent. Got here 12 hrs early and I have only had it for about 10 hrs but works great. Buying a high priced used electronic can be scary but can not speak highly enough of this experience.
yes,yes,yes,"I've been thoroughly happy with my Note 4 over the past year. It is just about as large as I'd want for a device which spends most of it's time in my pocket. This was one of my main concerns but the only time it's large size has been a problem is during one handed typing, so not very often!"
no,no,no,Phone was defective won't go pass the home screen
yes,yes,yes,"On time. As described. No issues...not 'new' but pretty close, for condition. Thank you. ;)"
no,no,no,The phone powers of on its own. Speaker is choppy. Callers can not hear me clearly qhen talking through the speaker phone.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works well but when it says that you can tell that it has been used, it has been USED. The charging port is beat up and there are a lot of dings on it. But still very functional."
yes,yes,yes,"love the phone, camera sucks."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy Note 4 looks excellent and works great!
yes,yes,yes,The phone came in great shape. I am very pleased with it.
yes,yes,yes,I bought a used phone from Gizmo and it works exceptionally well except for a few hiccups once in a while and it overheating alot which I find annoying at times. I don't know if that has to do with the phone itself being used or just a Samsung flaw. But otherwise it works very well.
no,no,no,I had a bad time with this phone. It wasnt inspected properly I think. It had many problems. -Malfunctioning Battery that would die quickly while displaying 30% capacity. -IR Baster didnt work -The phone's firmware had been rooted or otherwise tampered with. Couldn't get updates.
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone. Read a lot about it before i purchased it. Not disappointed at all.
no,no,no,Most everything said above is true except if you get a bad one which tends to be recycled endlessly. My 1st phone failed for some reason i forgot but every so called inspected as ok phone they have sent me drops calls. In good reception areas.
yes,no,yes,"With the news that like the galaxy s6, the next Note would lack a removable battery and expandable storage, I jumped at getting this. All in all I am very impressed and I use the stylus more than I expected."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had the note 4 for about 2 weeks now and can I say awesome?! I love this phone. My husband and I both switch from an iphone. But that doesn't mean I'm partial to one eco system. I have an iPad mini, MacBook pro, hp laptop, Ipod , android tablets and now the note 4."
yes,yes,yes,"I've owned the Galaxy S2 and S3, but this is my first Note.I simply love it - it's the new and improved version of my S3. I love the extra functions that come with the stylus. I thought the size would be a problem, but I actually like the bigger size; it's so much easier to use the camera and to..."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had my Note4 since the day they came out, I found it a little bigger than my old galaxy s4 but the bigger battery, quick charger,expandable memory, pen,and other features made it the best phone I've ever owned, I was looking at the note 5 but realized you can't change the battery not that..."
yes,yes,yes,Love it. Like new.
yes,yes,yes,I bought this Note 4 for my wife since I love mine. She needed a replacement for her Galaxy III which was getting tired and has a much smaller screen. She loves the Note 4 with it's large screen and snappy response.
yes,no,yes,S-Pen enough said.
no,yes,yes,Wasnt the right phone at all but not their fault it was mine i should of read it right. Sorry
yes,yes,yes,"Love it! Coming from Samsung Exhilarate, huge change!"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone great battery great pics and lighting fast
no,yes,no,Bad teception..dont get hardly any calls..
no,no,no,"Cosmetically this phone is in pristine condition!! But after days two of use, I started to have issues with the phone and they have only been getting worse and irritating me. It constantly freezes, reboots for no reason, gets stuck on reboot screen, non responsive a lot of times!!"
yes,yes,yes,Phone came on time and works exceptionally well
no,yes,no,"was very nice , was not unlock had to return it"
no,no,yes,A lot of software bugs
no,yes,yes,"I really enjoyed this phone while it was on Kitkat but the second 5.0.1 was introduced this phone became a memory leaking nightmare. I can't even run facebook messenger, Faebook, Bacon Reader, Chrome, their own internet app, Spotify or Waze without the apps crashing. Fallout Shelter?"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Plan on buying another one.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome Phone. Its almost like a hand held computer. Extremely practical and functionally superior!
yes,yes,yes,Best phone thus far. Solid phone and does not seem to be buggy. Screen is a perfect size. Excellent features. I believe this is the last model you can add memory and swap out the battery. Samsung has a winner here--too bad they are moving toward the Apple model with the next series.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing. I have enjoyed it since the minute I opened the package. At first I was a little concerned because it said could not recognize Sim card. But it quickly went away after I went to Verizon to get my Sim card switched... the prepaid plan and the unlocked device is the way to go.
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded my Note 3 to this through Verizon. I had an opportunity to examine a pre-release model of the Note 5, and that is the reason why I am writing this review. Do NOT wait for the 5 unless you absolutely have to have the latest phone."
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone for a little over two months and I love it. The size of the screen is nice. And the battery life is awesome. I'm glad I upgraded when I did.
yes,yes,yes,This is a review after owning the Note 4 for about 11 months. Normally a manufacturer would and should retain the feature from older versions. Not so in this case...this is not a good phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone so far, not sure if it was brand new as stated on the listing. The stick on protective covering on the back was off but in the box and there were no earbuds in the box at all. My husband purchased the same phone thru our wireless provider and it came with earbuds."
yes,yes,yes,"I have been using this phone for a year now. I like it a lot, but I do have trouble hearing on it sometimes. That might be do to the Otterbox, but can be frustrating. Other than that I love the phone and its functionality."
yes,yes,yes,I Use This Phone and works Great Love It
yes,yes,yes,It was perfect for me
no,no,no,The antenna has issues poor signal strength
no,no,no,"The issue I have is that the phone was not unlocked when I received it. After getting it unlocked, I find that whomever had this device previously, did not clear out their Samsung Account properly and now it's locked to their account ""due to an abnormal factory reset."
yes,yes,yes,"S pen works accurately, battery last for well over 24 hours and that is with listening get to Pandora and tunein radio for 10 hours. Graphics are crisp and clear. Camera works well. If I needed a phone, I would buy this again."
yes,yes,yes,Really great phone. I have a note 2 so i really thought this was the best way to go. I didn't care for the home buttons it just felt odd and i don't like the new panel for the pen for it to work. The note 2 pen was easy just take out and use. But the screen is great and it's a fast working device.
yes,yes,yes,very good phone. suits all of my needs
yes,yes,yes,"nice phone works great, however; i didnt know that by purchasing this phone that i would get caught up in a two year contract by the carrier. i have order a phone before and this never happen maybe it has something to do with the carrier."
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded my Note 3 to this through Verizon. I had an opportunity to examine a pre-release model of the Note 5, and that is the reason why I am writing this review. Do NOT wait for the 5 unless you absolutely have to have the latest phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone, the camera is the absolute best! but it's obvious something is wrong with it, and I'll have to return it. The phone has a glitch that makes it black out in the middle of what I'm doing."
yes,yes,yes,"Just like new. Better than expected and yes the phone is great, too. Bought for my wife and happily enjoying upgrade from S4."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this for my husband and I'm so jealous because I want one too... can't wait to purchase mine's!!!
yes,yes,yes,"Can't say enough about this phone, love it."
yes,yes,yes,I use this phone more as a tablet. Outstanding! Can't go wrong if you need bigger screen and ridiculous resolution. Highly recommended!
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I ever had
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Google expert reviews to get the rest…. You're welcome.
yes,yes,yes,"Exactly as described. Not a nick or scratch, may as well have been sent from the manufacturer. It was and is perfect!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone, I am very satisfied with purchase."
yes,no,yes,"The phone does the job, but there are a variety of software issues that have really taken away from my overall experience with it. The primary issue is stutter and lag. There's visible jitter with animations when scrolling, switching between apps, opening or closing apps and texting."
yes,yes,yes,"Love love love my note 4, love the screen, which is easily readable even in bright sun light, the battery is awesome, the camera takes great pictures and to top it all, the fingerprint scanner works very well for me (unless my fingers are wet)"
yes,yes,yes,How is this a Business Phone & You cant Talk & Websurf at the same time..... This Phone is Garbage. Just Get a Note 3 and Be Happy.
no,no,no,Ok phone. Gets heavy sometimes. Battery dies at 20 percent and freezes often. Then again its a used phone from online so not expecting much.
yes,yes,yes,shipped fast worked well
yes,yes,yes,Very nice phone and as item description
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I've ever had
yes,yes,yes,Perfect replacement for my Note3
yes,yes,yes,"Great item, great price."
yes,yes,yes,"I just got this phone about 5 days ago, but I absolutely love it so far. It comes with a pedometer and food log installed which I love. I've been trying to lose weight and I've lost 1.8 lbs in the 5 days I've been tracking what I eat and how many steps I take. It's nice and big."
no,no,no,This is an awesomeness sandwich with a side of bad assness!
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had a little time to use this, so this is just my general overview. For technical specifications and professional reviews, there is always ""Google it."" To make this review as efficient as possible, I will do a quick run-over, and also a comparison with other phones you might be most..."
no,yes,no,Phone is okay I guess. Os seems choppy at times. Even after all the updates.
yes,yes,yes,"Great unit, big clear screen, and long lasting battery."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, great price!"
yes,yes,yes,I love it. Came In great shape. Its like having my whole life in the palm of my hands.
yes,yes,yes,So far this phone is great! I went from a Motorola back to a Samsung and I don't think I will ever use anything but Samsung again.
yes,no,yes,So far this has been an excellent purchase my best of 2015 actually. This phone was defiantly worth the money and at the used price it was a steal. It's condition was nearly flawless rather than one minor screen scratch that wasn't even noticeable unless you looked at it very closely.
yes,yes,yes,Very user friendly and I love the multiple window visuals.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm glad I upgraded from the Galaxy S4 to the Note 4. The camera is a vast improvement over the S4. The sound quality on phone calls is excellent. It did take a good part of a day to get everything set up correctly. Yes, there is plenty of bloatware but most phones have that problem."
yes,yes,yes,"Great deal, love everything about the phone and was in very good state"
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with this phone. I am loving it!!
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I have ever owned and I've had a lot of phones! I bought this phone to replace a Note 2. What a difference between the two phones. The camera is wonderful - pictures are sharp and clear. They are actually better than my very expensive camera.
yes,yes,yes,Just as described!
no,yes,yes,AWESOME PHONE! But the boot loader is locked f*$# you att and verison!! phone is worthless now after waiting 6 months for a root and not im out over 400$ because its decreesed in value and i want to sell this piece of S@#$.
yes,yes,yes,The phone works perfectly
yes,yes,yes,"This will be a fairly short review, listing pros and cons with a short summary. I've had the phone nearly a year now and have had several Android phones and an iPhone 5S. Pros: * Large, high quality display * Good camera, though grainy even in moderate light (oversharpening)."
yes,yes,yes,"Beautiful phone, perfectly packed and shipped, was a gift to myself, still working my way through all the great features! Thanks."
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had it a day but i can say that i should have gotten this phone the day it came out! Great size, picture, sound, speed and look! Thank you Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone was clearly the best phone of 2014-2015 and now it will be the note 5 for 2015-2016
yes,yes,yes,Was all it said it was. Delivery was early.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It was a great deal.
yes,yes,yes,"I like this phone but there are things I don't like too. I've always had a rooted phone, mostly because I like control of my phone. Verizon and AT&T have thought it necessary to lock the bootloader and not allow root. There is a root for this phone, but only good until the next reboot, not fun!"
yes,yes,yes,"Well, it was great until AT&T forced the infamous Lollipop 5.0.1 operating system ""upgrade"" and messed up a bunch of stuff."
yes,yes,yes,"My wife loves everything about this phone, great battery, awesome screen, exceptional utilities. She really loves the calendar and camera."
yes,no,yes,"I like it on the some of degree ,it is not only very practical and also very suitable for me！"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone love the pen for quick memos longer battery life sometimes lags but not nearly as often as my S3 or S4 did the Verizon bloat ware doesn't help so I don't fully blame Samsung on that, excellent screen size and performs all other daily necessary functions for the person on the go, cheaper..."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone I have ever owned. The S-pen is what caught my eye. I wish I can add more to this review, but there is so much I like about this phone that I can't fit it all here! Great job Samsung, I'll be keeping this Note 4 until my contract renews!"
no,no,no,"The Spen doesn't work. I bought this phone for the Spen. I am very upset. Also, the ""free car charger"" is a 25 cent charger port from a gas station."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent case! All of buttons line up along with the mic and speaker holes. Also fits very well!
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely wonderful phone. Very responsive, had the Note 2 before and it is a great improvement."
yes,no,yes,I planned to get the Galaxy 6 as soon as it was available. I was so excited until.... Samsung made the dumbest design decision - No removable battery and no ability to add a SD card. If I wanted a phone with less options than the Galaxy 3-4-5 - I could have bought an iPhone!
no,no,no,Phone constantly reboots. Battery overheats and as I write this its gone from 50% to 47% plugged in. Sometimes it doesn't even respond when trying to exit am app. Not saying this is anyone's fault I bought a used phone and got a used phone. Update: Last week lost all ability to view the screen.
yes,yes,yes,"I really love my Galaxy Note 5, I was user of Galaxy S5 and the last time i use Note Series was year 2012 (Galaxy Note 10.1). The Galaxy Note 5 really help me in my daily productivity with above average battery performance."
yes,yes,yes,There is a some points which i observe in note 5 which is disappoint me.
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is the first Note phone I have owned, but is by far one of the most sophisticated phones I have ever had. First off, the design, amazingly beautiful. I have the black sapphire color and whenever light hits it just right, man that shiny color shines!"
yes,yes,yes,Only had this phone for a couple of days. By far the best I have used so far and that includes the S5 Would recommend in a heartbeat. You don't really need to expand storage because there is always online storage available
yes,yes,yes,I bought the gold 64gb version and it is such an attractive phone. I am coming from an iphone 5 that I was using for over 2 years and the Note just smashes it in every category. The gold color looks absolutely stunning and does a great job at masking the fingerprints on the back.
yes,yes,yes,"I sold iphone 6s just after 1 month use and bought this. Im sooo satisfied. It is great. Reliable helper on day to day life. Health app is soo great. It mortivates me for exercising ,heart rate sensor is also a worthy addition. Love it... A very good choice if you are looking for a big display."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone but not such a significant difference to upgrade from note 3, especially from note 4. The premium materials is not my first choice for the body but still looks great as a trade of for durability."
yes,yes,yes,"It's almost impossible to go wrong here, hardware-wise. The phone is amazing to look at, the camera is fantastic, the display is the best I've ever seen and it's snappy and quick to use."
yes,yes,yes,i have 32 gb gold version and i am using it for a month and its the best thing i ever had ... the camera is addictive !...very addictive the note 5 is very beautiful and eye catching spen is at its peek since note started it ! and its working like a charm
yes,yes,yes,"In all aspects, compared to any other phone I've seen or used, this is honestly the best designed, best made, most powerful phone I've ever owned. The S pen is more of an accessory rather than a vital part of the phone I'd say, but everything else more than sells it."
yes,yes,yes,This is my first time to own a Samsung branded mobile and I can say that it is one hell of a smartphone. Camera is superb and the manual mode is a good option to have. I just love it in every way. And the lack of SD Card slot don't bother me at all.
yes,yes,yes,"i had an HTC one m8 and i loved it but it lacked things . this is hands down the most all around phone out there , read the details below for more (this is coming from a person that is the ""phone fixer/expert"" in my family and group of friends so i handled many many phones for long periods of time )"
yes,yes,yes,"you will find a lot of shorts, but at the same time you will never find an over all better phone, it ticks all the important things a normal-to-average-power-user will ever need, more further, those who are really supreme user will be still somehow happy with it"
yes,yes,yes,"I bought my Note 5 two days after release, upgrading from a Note 3. I thought the Note 3 was a great phone, but this one was a huge improvement in the way of design and performance."
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone, it is the best phone that I have had and I strongly recommend sever yore to buy it if it is in your budget. It has nothing wrong with it to me and it looks really in the front with the screen graphics."
yes,yes,yes,"I recently made the switch from my LG G3 which I felt was the best phone I have ever owned. It was perfect in so many ways. Until, I made the switch to the note 5. I looked all the new phones the edge the edge+ the 6s+ and none of them felt comfortable in my hands."
yes,yes,yes,"The Note5 improves on almost everything that the Note 4 had a problem with. It is a near-flawless phone. For such power from such a small device, the battery life is lengthy for the average user. The screen is beautiful if one wants to watch videos and the user experience is stress-free."
yes,no,yes,"Except for some cons as no sd-card, IR sensor and non removable battery which is indeed not a big issue considering the battery timing, Note 5 in my opinion is full of perfection considering every kind of use from a gamer to multimedia and video entertainer to photographer to in office users."
yes,yes,yes,"It is the best note I ever had, nice, super fast efficient, the battery lasts the whole day, the s-pen incredible, excellent fast and lap top power, the screen and the camera could not be better .. I'm super happy....."
yes,yes,yes,"I smashed my old phone Samsung Galaxy S3 display to pieces, hence the need for new phone for various reasons. I chose Note 5 in Optus store from the selection they had for my price range of about maximum of 60 dollars per month."
yes,yes,yes,"One of the best Android phones I've owned, if not the best. There are some drawbacks to this phone, but the overall package makes up for all the negatives at the very end. Overall if you can afford it, buy it... you won't regret this investment."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is very impressive phone. All the features are excellent like design, camera, battery etc. Galaxy Note 5 can be the best option for you if you are looking for a stylish phone. I highly recommended for this. For more details you can visit at Samsung India site."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! If you turn the display to basic you can easily get 6hrs screen on time. Mix that with power saving mode and you can get 7.5hrs+ screen on time. The ram management is a big disappointment. Otherwise the phone is pretty snappy. The fingerprint scaner is so inconsistent.
yes,yes,yes,And finally Samsung produces a Smartphone that is a BEAUTY from the outside and a BEAST (in terms of Performance) from the inside.nThe interface is buttery smooth with no lags whatsoever.nCamera opens up super fast by double clicking the home button and the image/video quality is just awesome.nJust...
no,no,yes,This phone advances on the Note 4 in only the most minimalist way while removing the option to expand the memory and offering a paltry 32 gig internal memory in most cases. What possessed Samsung to remove the SD card slot is totally beyond me.
yes,yes,yes,"i find it as a best buy so far, samsung is good with experiments. takes their products to edge further.incredible improved bettery life ,few new feature to device and made all new experince for the users."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone but battery and Micro SD Card but I can deal with it since I bought home base cloud for the place of SD card other then that I love the phone battery buy a rechargeable battery and keep it on you all the time because there is alot of places where you can't plug it in the wall
yes,yes,yes,"Build quality is just awesome, it feels so good in hands and even the camera just your a double click away! and the camera opens ! it cannot be faster! resolution and call quality is ... no words! No words to describe this phone"
yes,yes,yes,"Everything is the best. All things like design, camera, price tag..... The best phone of 2015. If you buy it you will love it very much. Bye one if you want if you want a stylish phone.Fighting Galaxy Note 5!"
yes,yes,yes,Paid for an expensive phone that performs barely better than my note 4. Don't believe the paid reviews. Bunch of lies. You're better off with the note 4 and if you look to upgrade wait til LG or apple decide to actually do a better job. Lazy work to get money is the motto for companies now...
yes,yes,yes,"this is the most stylish new phone on the market yet. this phone is fast, effective and just really easy to use."
yes,yes,yes,"Got my phone 2 days back, migrating from S4 so can not talk about improvements from last year phones. I don't need external storage or removable battery, so it might be con for most but not for me. UI speed will feel good to me obviously as I am coming from S4."
yes,yes,yes,I have yet to really find a problem with this phone outside of the non-removeable battery and lack of SDcard slot and these arnt really issues for me based on my usage habits. Everything else is absolutely superb. Very glad I bought it.
yes,yes,yes,"one of the best phablet out there or quite possibly, the best! It's beautiful physically and maybe less beautiful in the inside. Note 5 is an improvement over the note 3 but if you have the note 4, better stick with it until note 6."
no,yes,no,"I went from a S5 to a Note 5. Besides the idiotic decision to provide no access to the battery or to a SD card slot, there is no infrared blaster, so no TV remote app will work on the Note 5."
yes,yes,yes,"In love with the stylus pen. If you love to take notes, doodle, draw, sketch, hover over icons to have a preview, then this is the phone for you. My favorite feature is being able to take out the stylus pen when the phone is 'asleep' and then jot down a note on the screen. Fast, simply, easy."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Gallaxy Note5 is excellent until the S pen stops working in a few weeks and your only option is to put your $700.00 phone it in the mail for repairs. That's the best reason to stay with the Apple iPhone. Local repairs and service in person.
yes,no,yes,"I am really enjoying my new Galaxy S5 Note, except for the S pen design. Hopefully lots of users will provide input about the pen so they will make changes for future models. The pen storage port and the headphone port are both on the bottom of the phone; I discovered last night in the dark that it..."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm really disappointed with this phone. I had great hopes, and they've been largely thwarted in the months I've had this device. I can get over the no removable battery, but why they didn't put an SD card door on the side of the phone is beyond me."
yes,yes,yes,"I have been using my 32 GB gold note 5 to take photos in the night. Although it is dark, the photos are excellent. i use the s pen and it is very responsive and sensitive and enjoy using it. however, it can get hot and laggy at times."
yes,yes,yes,"PROs + operation speed noticeably higher than Note 4 + great build quality (but very fragile) + improved camera (better image quality, must faster start and stop) + significantly faster loading speed of photos and videos + models SM-N920CD, N920C, N920F, N920K, and N920S support UMTS LTE Band B3,..."

yes,yes,yes,I'm very happy I made this purchase. I saved a couple hundred dollars by not buying a phone through my carrier. I'm using this phone in place of my recalled Note 7. I'm on t Mobile network in upstate NY. It works great. Very smooth operation. No problems at all.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! I have tmobile and all I had to do was buy a nano Sim card from the tmobile store and have them activated and boom!!!! It works!!! I had a Samsung Galaxy 4 and I upgraded to the note 5. I loved the cheaper price and the color I couldn't get this color with tmobile.
yes,yes,yes,Amazing perfect All good
yes,yes,no,Exactly as described only problem is it has a European charger. The first one I bought came with an adapter the second one didn't
yes,yes,yes,Beautifully designed and definitely met my expectations. All around great phone!
yes,yes,yes,Got it had a couple problems with sipping. But they handled it very professionally. And solvede the problem quickly. Phone works great and was able to use with my current Sim card with no issues
yes,yes,yes,My daughter loved it.
no,no,yes,Phone has worked fine in the 6 months I have had it but the battery drains fast and I really miss the removable battery and the ability to add more memory.
yes,yes,yes,Thanks a million.....my wife is happy with this product!
no,no,no,No slot to add extra memory is the worst mistake Samsung did. It is just like an iPhone. That's why I settle for an LG V10.
yes,yes,yes,DON'T MOVE TO MARSHMALLOW FROM LOLLIPOP Samsung software. This phone worked fairly well until I did that. After I updated the software version I lost many important functions of the phone. My ability to use apps needed for my firestick tv no longer worked. They cut off the back door.
no,no,no,Unit arrived ok and appears to be functional. The charger however had no compatible plug (male) and I am still not able to charge it without borrowing someone's charger.

yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome, the price for this phone is good as compating to iphone 6s plus and galaxy s7. However it doesn't comes with edge display but the back is fully curved and the glass body is fantastic."

yes,yes,yes,"Excellent price:)), my wife totally happy with her new gsm, especially practical with 2 sim cards"
yes,yes,yes,"I loved my new note 5. The size ,and the photos is the most wonderfull .much better that iphone."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. The only two drawbacks is the lack of expandable memory with micro SD and not being able to replace battery.
yes,yes,yes,"Excelent smartphone. One of the best money can buy. The only problem for me was the fingerprint sensor, it's not really reliable."
no,yes,yes,Number one you cannot remove the battery which means the government can spy on me. Number 2 I cannot use an external memory. You have to put everything on a cloud which goes back to number one. The government can spy on! LOL!
yes,yes,yes,very good finished of the fasade
yes,yes,yes,Had an S6 and was having issues with battery life so I sold it got this phone from another supplier and i am happy I did. Dual SIM wasn't necessary but nice to have. Set up was easy and i was on cricket in no time.
no,yes,no,"can't change it to pure English and no samsung pay. predictive text is horrible... what better on the AT&T version or any U.S. samsung phone. if you need two n numbers, just get Google voice and save yourself the headache"
yes,yes,yes,"The cell phone is simply excellent. But I had to pay u$S 650 to Uruguayan customs, in order to have my phone handed to me. I consider that an excess!"
yes,yes,yes,Solid build. Stunning performance. Rather big and heavy for one hand manipulation.
no,yes,yes,"too fragile screeen, do not put the spen inside reverse"
yes,yes,yes,Am loving my Samsung galaxy note 5. Don't have words to describe it. But I urge you to experience it ...it's the best phone
yes,yes,yes,Real good Flagship phone. I don't have any issues with it. And the Silver is amazing. Only complaint is the charger that is Chinese and comes with converter.
yes,yes,yes,"great phone, it's send from Hong Kong, Asia version"
yes,yes,yes,Great device Great service
no,yes,no,After a couple of days from buying this device and very light use I get errors coming up that it fails to read my Sim cards. Samsung refused to replace it although it was a faulty device from the manufacturer. Worst experience of my life and would never deal with Samsung again.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone love the dual sims, the phone gives you easy control of which number is used. Manager at Att even let me add insurance."
yes,yes,yes,"I had an excellent experience. The phone is beautiful, new factory, comes in a sealed container. this is not a replica, is the original Samsung, is made in Vietnan. At first power: we must pay close attention to not advance to select the language of the operating system, it is framed at the top,..."
yes,no,yes,"I have used Note 2, Note 3, Note Edge previously. When Note 4 or even 5 came out, I didn't switch because I was so satisfied with my Note Edge with the one-of-a-kind edge function on Note Edge - which still stands true. But I wanted to use Gear VR that only supports Galaxy S6 or Note 5."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone!!!
yes,no,yes,Best Cellphone I ever had Better my Note 4 and you can use 2 differents sim cars better if you have to travel for work
yes,yes,yes,"I know there's been a great ranting about the Note 5 not having removable battery, no micro SD card and no IR Blaster..although I had owned other android phones with the aforementioned characteristics (except for the IR Blaster) I must say that I don't think I'll be needing them (I have the Dash..."
yes,no,yes,"So i have had them all: Iphone 6, Iphone 6+, iphone 6s+, oneplus two, LG G3, Moto X, and all previous iphones. Today, In my opinion the note 5 is the best smartphone you can get. I chose this dual sim because i travel a lot and it works like a charm."
yes,no,yes,I attempted to use this phone's dual sim capabilities to replace my work and personal phone into one. My last Samsung phone was the Note 2 and while I noticed several improvements I did not quite notice enough considering this is 3 generations later.
no,yes,yes,Its only 32 gigs no expansion at all and u can not change battery in it. Don't Recommend.
yes,yes,yes,"I was using the note 4 for 9 months, experience was great. I switched to this Dual SIM note 5 mainly because of the additional SIM slot for oversea travel. Dual SIM function is great, didn't affect battery life, on/off SIM is easy."
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone for a few days and so far it's been fantastic! :Works well with T-Mobile and AT&T.
yes,yes,yes,"Despite all the negative comments from previous Note users, I must add that this phone is fantastic. I've been using it for six months now and I have had no issues whatsoever. The quality of its hardware and the support this phone has is simply the best for me. No Micro-SD card? Well.."
yes,yes,yes,love my new phone. The only problem is that take to long to receive the item.
yes,yes,yes,wow very nice like it.
yes,no,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 5, powered by it's Exynos 7420, is at the forefront of Samsung's smartphone offerings. With the best display Samsung can offer, market leading specifications, magnificent build quality and a price to match, the Note5 (as styled by Samsung) cements it's spot as not only the..."
yes,yes,yes,Bought for my Husband for his Birthday. Absolutely fantastic. Ordered it on Tuesday lunchtime and it arrived Wednesday lunchtime. Fantastic.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, S-pen can feel a little flimsy but overall a great phone. Fingerprint scanner is very reliable and is very fast, phone is fast responsive, stylus is a very handy function for me as a student. The phone is very slippery so I do recommend buying a case to prevent chances of dropping."
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone came the next day I would buy again 10/10
yes,yes,yes,Just what I need on a phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Great product. Everything about this smartphone is exactly what is described. Being an international phone, the power transformer must be changed for an American model (can be replaced for less than 10$)"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, BEWARE: UK CHARGER. But they sent an adapter."
yes,yes,yes,"Parfait, tel que commandé."
yes,yes,yes,I'm very happy with the new phone
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Zippy.
yes,yes,yes,Arrivedon time .Works well
yes,yes,yes,Not worth the price
yes,yes,yes,"Works perfectly! Fast and without problems. I use it in sweden wirth both Tele2 and Telenor, just great! Now just waiting for Android Marshmallow! :-)"
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone. Love it!
no,no,no,Is the worst phone i have ever had special with the battety running so fast every time and heats up quickly.
yes,yes,yes,"After I broke my note 4 my warranty ended up with me receiving a note 5 as the 4 was not being produced anymore, and I could not have been happier. Its a huge aesthetic upgrade over the note 4, which is the biggest thing I've noticed. I haven't had any problems with it thus far."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone..thumbs up
yes,yes,yes,Ooohh - it's niiicce. :)
yes,yes,yes,Thank you so much I love this fon I got it with the uk charger + an adapter for Canada thank u ♡♡♡♡♡
yes,yes,yes,"Original product ,highly recommended ,the only problem it' s an uk version."
no,yes,no,The fone heats up most times.
yes,yes,yes,The best phablet on the market
yes,yes,yes,Great product and great warranty I would advice anyone buy from this company
yes,no,yes,Awesome smart phone. Does everything I want and the battery life is good.
yes,yes,yes,"Very good product, and better seller. Thabks."
yes,no,yes,"The Note 5 got smaller and the screen got bigger. In order to achieve this incredible feat, the screen now touches the edge of the device. Which is amazing for viewing, but it makes the device impossible to hold."
no,no,yes,I got the wrong phone
no,no,no,DONT BUY THIS PHONE ITS A FAULTY PHONE AND A WASTE OF MONEY WITH NO REALISTIC WARRANTY FOR ITS INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product.
yes,yes,yes,"Good Phone, I used it for a couple of days and exchanged it for Galaxy S6. The size on the phone is a big annoyance especially for one hand handling. The Stylus though is good to use, but frankly for normal daily use, its not a big use. Overall the phone did not have any issues."
yes,yes,yes,I am very happy with my phone. The photos are real good
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is so awesome. What a powerful phone, it does what it says, it's sleek and comfortable to hold in your hand, I love everything about it. I was an iPhone user before this phone, I am now an android fan for sure, and it's because of this phone. Samsung you done yourself proud."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love it. I end had this phone linked up to both straight talks T-Mobile and AT&T arrive. Both worked! But T-Mobile service is always horrible so I highly recommend you get an AT&T Sim! Don't make the mistake of accidently buying a T-Mobile Sim.
no,yes,no,totally disappointed first expensive and delayed shipment. second buy an international phone and surprise no Spanish language. I do not understand how an international phone does not have Spanish language.
yes,no,no,"I upgraded to this phone from the Note 3. While the problem of battery life had been insufficiently improved upon since past versions of the Note and remains feeble, it has been made that much worse by the battery being locked."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, mostly because I haven't had a phone for about 8 years.and this was an incredible leap but regardless of that, thus phones battery life is not bad at all, I watch a lot of shows and movies when on the road and I travel a lot, I could watch all star wars movies with the brightness..."
yes,yes,yes,"I received this for Christmas and haven't stopped playing with it yet. It's awesome to learn a new feature almost on a daily basis. Plus the camera and video quality is off the charts.When it comes to sound, this phone is amazing whether you're watching a movie, playing a game or just talking."
no,no,yes,I was so excited to receive my phone because I wasn't expecting to receive it so soon. But it came a week early. Everything was package correctly and the phone is beautiful. (Gold) Also it came with the international charger and they shipped the travel adapter with it which was a plus.
no,yes,no,Product is ok some function like samsung pay not working they advertise that if you have at&t and if you are in usa samsung pay should work when i tried to download samsung pay got message that this device is not compatible with samsung pay. ..disappointed
yes,yes,yes,"The best phone ever made. The 4g seems big but you don't really get that much play. The camera and screen is clear and crisp. Get a good case, cause this phone will break at one drop."
yes,yes,yes,Paint app not included. Its now only available thru subscription. I switched to Corel PhotoPaint for Android. Same tools.
yes,yes,yes,Simply the fastest Android phone as of 2015. And the best camera on a smartphone. Beats the iPhone 6s camera but only by a little. The Best Phone Out Now Period!!!
no,yes,no,"S pen is stuck in the phone due to no fault of my own (tip end first as the owner's manual states; pressing the button on the end of the pen does nothing). Samsung support is terrible. Glass cover over rear camera is incredibly fragile. Be warned, the note 5 is not here to last."
no,yes,no,"I have had my Note 5 for 2 months now. I am reporting an annoying Note 5 problem. If I want to use internet or an app that need to access internet, then very often it shows loading.... forever without actual results. Sometime this freezes the device too."
yes,yes,yes,"A beautiful white phone complemented by equally amazing pen. Have installed all the apps I wanted and phone is still super fluid. No lag whatsoever. The phone itself sits on the palm firmly, thanks to its curved back. Battery life is insane."
yes,yes,yes,I am from Barbados and I recently received my galaxy note 5 32GB and since I received it i love this very awesome device . It fit the hand neatly and it is very comfortable. The speed of the device is tremendous and the way it opens up apps and webpages it is superb.
yes,yes,yes,Its a great product BUT...it will NOT fully work in networks which uses LTE BAND 20 (Vodafone and T-Mobile Germany for example)...please be aware of that!
yes,yes,yes,Great phone can't wait
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is solid. No sdcard and removable battery can disappoint for those who think it matters. Sadly there are allot of negative reviews that don't relate to phone. Like fingerprint swiping failing, which is cause you do not swipe."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm not really a techy person, so I don't know if this phone is up to date or not. All I know is it got cool specs and some quality camera."
yes,yes,yes,"Bought it to take with me to europe (samsung did not release it here). Excellent device. Love notes. Had 1, 2 and now jumped to 5. Stylus is awesome."
no,no,no,Charger stopped working after a few days. New Update The phone stopped working after less than three months.
yes,yes,yes,Everything is good. I'd recommend it
yes,yes,yes,Good Android phone. Samsung Galaxy's mobiles are pretty good.
yes,yes,yes,"Design Say goodbye to the plastic designs of the past Samsung phones. The new ones now contain glass (it is Corning Gorilla Glass 4, which is very high quality and durable) and a new sleek design."
yes,yes,yes,"There's a lot to learn, but am very pleased with its capability."
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone but have problems with opening my text message , otherwise like my phone"
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone I've only had it for about near a month but it's everything I wanted.
yes,yes,yes,great phone!! fast and good signal..but what the heck was i thinking to pay alot for a phone thats not waterproof after dropping it in water at work it died... so a warning to those who are clumsy just get the samsung galaxy the new one that just came out its waterproof unlike this one i really...
no,yes,yes,"This phone will be amazing... for the first three months. You will then run into software issues spanning from and unresponsive screen, Bluetooth connects dropping out, and it literally not charging."
yes,yes,yes,"In theory I love this phone. The functionality, the set up, the ease of use. I do. I love it. The stylus for note taking is a particular favorite feature for a nerd like me- I can jot down a note without looking at a keyboard or opening an app- super handy in dark rooms while listening to nerds(said..."
yes,yes,yes,It runs really great and looks awesome .. wonderful phone. Highly recommended.
yes,yes,yes,It's making my wife happy that it's fast and easy to use
no,yes,yes,"The product description was misleading, it left out information on being an international phone. Before I ordered the phone, I didn't understand ""Region"" codes, so immediately purchased the phone after scouring the page for any 'international' nonsense."
no,yes,yes,Not able to charge it
yes,yes,yes,The cell is not What I expected
no,no,no,"It's been les than a month since I got this phone and today it just won't work, are you selling used phones? It is not a product I would recommend"
yes,yes,yes,I love my unlocked note 5 . All good.
no,no,no,Won't hold a charge 8hrs.when I ask google a question it answers in foreign language even tho I put English for language.cant find my downloads.just over all very disappointed with phone.
yes,yes,yes,I love my new Note 5! I upgraded from a broken Note II. I really don't like change but this was a great move. The quality of the phone is great especially the screen and camera.
yes,yes,yes,excellent service and product. GREAT!!!
yes,yes,yes,It's awesome ... everything works fine

yes,yes,yes,Everything I expected and more.
yes,yes,yes,Is an amazing phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I previously wasn't iPhone customer. But after switching to Samsung I believe that I will never have a different brand of phone. I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy Note 5 it is perfect for reading emails, sending emails, and calendar items."
no,no,no,"The product came without the S pen, I was on a trip and its a pain all the process for the return."
no,no,yes,Twice now I have gotten this phone wet on accident. I shut it off and charge it after it spazzes out and leave it overnight and it turns right back on the next morning. I'd like to see an IPhone do that. Or see an iPhone survive at least one drop test.
no,yes,no,How my phone it was working fine at first a few week in it started acting up.it will open other pages while I am typing turn on and of for no reason. It's only 2 week and its useless I have to buy another phone now
yes,yes,yes,"I have had a Note, Note 2, Note 4, and now the 5. I gave my husband my Note 4, and think I preferred that to the 5. 1. the battery is not removable... tsk tsk, 2. There is no SD slot, again... tsk tsk. 3. The stylus feels flimsier than the others. I hate the useless clicker aspect to the stylus."
no,yes,yes,the phone fell from my hand a short distance on carpet and the Spen got ejected and snappd in two.had to take it to service and buy a new one. cost me around $50
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone but came with some difficulties.
yes,yes,yes,"So far im loving this phone (legit phone hope it works in the philippines too). This is my 3rd day of using it, but how i wish it has sd card storge because ive noticed samsung updates apps automatically. Ive also noticed that the phone reboots on itself and crashes ocassionally like Iphones too."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. The camera is amazing. Am still getting used to it but so far i love it.
no,no,yes,"Hey jus to let u know the first three months of using this phone was great no problems at all but now the phone ain't charging, restart on its own and is running hot. At this stage and for a new phone it shouldn't be giving those problems at all."
yes,yes,yes,LOVE LOVE LOVE MY PHONE!! After I had accidentally dropped my Nokia Lumia 1020 in the lake and was devastated. I invested in buying the Note 5 after a lot of thought and comparision between different models of Samsung. Best money I have ever spent on a phone so far <3
yes,yes,yes,Great phone I love it.
yes,yes,yes,bought it from my husband and he's enjoying the new phone. Will definitely buy another one if had the money :-)
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone. There's no need for me to mention the specs, this is a top of the line phone; therefore the processor, camera, etc are all top tier. The battery usually lasts me about 1 day and a half with moderate to heavy usage."
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased this phone for my father to take back home to Pakistan, he wanted dual sim model but after using this device for few days he was satisfied and ignored it not being dual sim. This cell phone is user friendly even for my father."
yes,yes,yes,Good phone. Everything works.
yes,yes,yes,DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT
yes,yes,yes,Really good product. I just wasn't expecting that kind of charger.
yes,yes,yes,"I am a fan of samsung, specially of the note. Love the pen and the fact that you can actually takes notes even if the screen is blocked. I am an architect and doodle a lot. It is unlocked and works perfectly in the country that I live in."
yes,yes,yes,Can't contact seller to find out where they bought my phone. Need this because Samsung won't fix a phone without knowing country of orgin.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy note series takes the best pictures of all cell phones. Great.
no,no,no,The screen stopped working in less than 30 days. I bought it again and the screen went out within 60 days. Quality does not match the price.
yes,yes,yes,Quick phone. Great processor. The 4gb of ram really makes a difference.
yes,yes,yes,Great product. Great value.
yes,yes,yes,Need an contact for you

yes,yes,yes,I'm using it in the Dominican Republic. Works perfect. Is my super cellphone. I'm in love with the Note 5. I keep all my note and agenda handwritten like it was on paper.
yes,yes,yes,"the pone it's really nice. The one I got has some small scratches on the bottom and on the finger scanner... The screen and rest of the phone looks good so it's not like it's used... but it does have those defects. Oh, also the ""international version"" has some ugly plugs from UK..."
no,no,no,Major battery issue . Not always fast charging. Does not hold charge. Most days need to charge battery twice. Sometimes back of phone gets quite hot.
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with it. The quality of the pictures is very good . I really love the pictures and all the applicationsame it has.

yes,yes,yes,I love it and would recommend it
yes,yes,yes,I had the s5 before and I have loved my phone. I changed because I dropped my phone and it broke. My spouse has the s7 edge and I can tell that this Note 5 is even better! Pros: 1. 16 mgpx camera 2. Bigger display than the s7 3. Thin and elegant 4.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product and service!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone! 5/5
yes,yes,yes,I love it only the battery doesn't last long even on a stand by mode
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent smartphone. I just wish Samsung hadn't discontinued so many features from Note 4, such as infra-red blaster (used to love IR remote control of my house gadgets), features non-removable battery (and which is slightly lower power than for Note 4), no microSD support -- but these deficiencies..."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent condition I am very satisfied. Not a single shkrecth.
yes,yes,yes,"We got some great phones. We have to reset them alot, but overall, very happy."
yes,yes,yes,It's wonderful. I have Metro PCS and it was a beautiful switch. No spot for an SD card. And you have to buy a SIM card which was $20. Also if you have Matrox PCS and are switching phones there will be a charge for that as well.
yes,yes,yes,I am a note user.. started with version 2 then 4 and when I dropped my 4 I had not much option as the 5 was out. I was hoping to wait for the 6 but oh well. Initially I thought I would hate the fact that there was no removeable battery but so far not an issue.
yes,yes,yes,So far no problem with my note 5. Lag-free with a very very good camera.
no,no,no,I am on my third replacement Samsung Note 5 phone in only 3 months. The battery life sucks. The phone frequently disconnects from the grid. The WiFi and hotspot constantly fail and have to be reset.

yes,yes,yes,"Honestly, this phone is amazing. I really don't even know how to make use of all the features it has, but once I learn they will sure come in handy. The feel is amazing, it's very slick and fits well on the hand."
no,yes,yes,"This is a nice-looking phone with great specs, but there have been so many minor bugs and annoyances occurring that I cannot recommend this phone to anyone. Some days I just want to throw it in the garbage."
yes,yes,yes,Superb mobile.. lovely piece.. performance is very good.. I am using in India.. slim and beautiful looks..4gb RAM is enough to run any application.. superb camera .. front and rear both.

yes,yes,yes,"Perfect packaging,the device as described."
yes,yes,yes,"Honestly, best phone I've ever had. I've always owned an iPhone but this this is durable, fast, great battery life, great apps, and more open than an iPhone, meaning you aren't quite constrained as an iPhone. Im sold."

yes,yes,yes,very good thank you
yes,yes,yes,"Purchased for someone else, they have no complaints."

yes,yes,yes,Absolutely love this phone. Awesome new features and upgrades from my Note 3. The pictures it takes are the best I've ever taken. Wish it had an expandable memory card slot but I've gotten used to sending my photos to the cloud. Totally love it.
yes,yes,yes,Ok so far but what the hell kinda charger is this??? Adding to my previous comment this phone does not have an IR blaster!! But the older models do. I'm bummed!! Samsung really messed up this time but the camera is nice. I'm very disappointed about the absense of the Infrared technology though.
yes,yes,yes,"I really appreciate my note 5. I have the sprint version but it is still great. Touchwiz is still incredibly annoying. I switch between the Google now and nova prime launcher. The themes help with making the gaudy touch wiz appearance better. I love the camera, a serious competitor for even DSLR's."
no,yes,yes,Battery gets warm frequently and sometimes hot. Otherwise it would be a great one.
yes,yes,yes,"absolutely in love with this phone! i was a long time android user before getting an iphone, i ended up missing andriod a lot so i went and bought the note 5 and i have no regrets."
no,no,no,"This phone doesnt work world wide, It only works in America..you get the N920G not the N920i Version. If you are planning traveling to Europe, Asia, Africa or Ocenia buy it."
yes,yes,yes,"Great camera, camcorder, display...it would be much easier to use with one hand if it was like the iPhone an just swipe to the right to go to the previous page an fast charging"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome. It has so many features and doesn't disappoint.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has it all!
no,yes,yes,Cannot change battery out
yes,yes,yes,"What a difference this phone is going to make in my life! The stylus is just what I needed for my clumsy fingers. This phone replaces a computer, laptop tablet and camera for me. Note 5 where have you been all my life?"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is fast, responsive, and very solidly built. It is well designed and is a beautiful phone. However, there are two problems with it which I find to greatly detract from its quality. First, reception on the AT&T network with this phone could be better."
no,yes,no,"This phone is no good not even a day after I started using it, the phone fell the screen was completely blank and scattered. So dissapointed"
yes,yes,yes,"I love my note 5. The screen is huge, which was a huge factor in me buying it. I don't use the stylus, but when I do, it works great."
yes,yes,yes,Came fast and am so much in love with this phone
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone! I had the note and the note 2. I went with another phone and was high disappointed. Nothing but the best from here on out and the best is definitely the Samsung Galaxy Note 5!

yes,yes,yes,"The Good: Beautiful new face lift, smoothest running phone I have ever used, one of the best phone cameras around, fantastic S-Pen experience, gorgeous screen The Bad: Closed in battery means not the greatest battery life, no expandable memory — the biggest hit the phone is taking, S-Pen software..."
yes,yes,yes,"It was unlocked as advertised. This phone is fast on the internet through my wifi. Graphics are beautiful. Camera is very good. After fully charging the battery and with average use, phone and internet, the battery was down to 30% after 48 hours, at which point I recharged it and it took 1 hour and..."
yes,yes,yes,"Truelly disappointed in Samsung. I have been with Google and Samsung. From the very beginning. I had always Apreciated Samsung for their better designed phones and variety. I was looking forward to this years, upgrade. To come and find out that the only actual difference was a glass back cover."
yes,yes,yes,"I liked my Galaxy S4 a lot until I sat on it, so I got a new Note 5 to replace it. I was looking forward to new features and maybe an unbreakable screen and unwarpable body if you accidentally sit on it. I quickly discovered that three major features of my S4 were gone. 1."
yes,yes,yes,"For readers, my opinions on this device (ATT 64Gb version) is based off the experiences I had with this device for the passed few days since launch day (Aug 21, 2015). I will continue to update this review in the future."
no,no,yes,I believe battery replacement is not crucial. I never carried or like to Carry extra batteries because it's a hassle when you can charge the note 5 and within 30 to 55 minstrel it's charge.
yes,yes,yes,1 Best phone in the market right now. 2 Cons Why everyone picking on samsung I phones never had removable batteries or micro sd expansion. 3 They are not the 1st to make a phone with a glass back or with glass overall all phones have glass screens so if you don't want to damage your 750 dollar phone...
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Detailed Review Premium Design It appears that Samsung has finally dropped plastic and leather casing on its flagship phones, and has now subscribed to using metal and glass casing for its top brand phones."
yes,yes,yes,"Lets make this Quick. #1. Bigger Display 100% Color Gamut OLED 5.7"" QHD #2. Smaller thinner and lighter than iPhone 6 Plus which has a smaller 5.5"" Display #3. 4GB DDR RAM is more than enough what other phone has 4GB of RAM #4. Fast Charging quick on the go 15 minutes gives you power for the day #5."
yes,yes,yes,Let me preface this review by saying I am a device and tech hound. I am coming from a perfectly good Galaxy S5 and choose to pay full price for an upgrade. It was worth every penny and don't regret the decision one bit.
yes,yes,no,"I just upgraded from the Note 4 to the Note 5, after a few days I was happy with my new device. There are some new features and most of the old ones. However when I was using my Note 5's Mobile Hotspot feature and received a phone call i noticed that my connected Laptop's Internet stopped working..."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone on 08/28/2015 5 days later, the rear camera's lens (hoping the camera it's fine) broke in a very strange way, without even falling once, I sent the phone to Samsung, and they'll take around a 7 business day, I spent 907$ on this phone exactly and I just decided to move from my..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, but the computing power seems lower than its specs. Maybe it is due to some optimization that needs to be done on the software (Android) side. The screen resolution is amazing, and I strongly recomend this phone to those seeking the comfort of a big screen, and the computing power of an..."
yes,yes,yes,"I lost my Note 4 and it was replaced by AT&T with a Note 5. Although it has some nice features it no longer has three of the features that caused me to buy it: removable battery, expandable memory and the IR blaster that I used with the excellent Peel remote control app."
yes,yes,yes,"Not only is this phone beautifully designed, it is so satisfying. The big screen just imersifies you and gives you a great experience. The new Touchwiz is also fantastic. It is fast, smooth, and essentially lag free. The 4 GB of RAM help with. This is by far the best phone I have ever owned."
yes,yes,yes,What can I say...it blows the Apple product out of the universe. People just stop what they are doing when I start taking notes... they are AMAZED! Truly a wireless FASSSST Charger if you get the charger with the capabilities.
yes,yes,yes,The best cellphone I've owned I love it. Upgraded from the Note 3.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone and have had it for a few weeks and enjoying it each time I hold it in my hand. This is my very first smart phone and it has be hook, line and sinker. I've had a cell phone for years and only used it occasionally for a real need."
yes,yes,no,"I bought my phone from Verizon, I got it to replace my note 3. I wish I had read the reviews first. I intend to return this device. I have had many Samsung and I could just move my memory card from phone to phone bring all my numbers and pics,video and music. I am so dissatisfied ,it makes me sad."
no,no,no,This product has major issue with WIFI connectivity. Samsung customer care executive don't want to trouble shoot the issue because it is international version.
yes,yes,yes,"This ohone is the best, I come from the note 4 so when I bought this oneI was skeptical about the build-in battery and no sd slot but I luv it its def worth the $750."
yes,yes,yes,"onDecember 3, 2015 Pros: Realistic color, Bright display, s pen Cons: Did not meet expectations, vr incapable, too expensive Overall this is a great phone but I've been reading a lot of reviews and checking out YouTube Reviews also and have found some very disturbing news about the virtual reality..."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone!! I had a LG G4 before this and now if i go back and use it it feels like im playing with a kids toy. It feels great in the hand and picture quality is amazing. Didnt think I'd like the S Pen but I end up using it all the time.
yes,yes,yes,Let me preface this review by stating that I am always looking for the best smartphone. So I am selling and buying new phones every few months. I have recently owned the iPhone 6 plus and the LG V10 and while they are both decent phones in their own rights they just don't hold a candle to the note...
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome colour. Not as loud a colour as I was expecting, which was good. Loved the stylus especially. Great phone."
yes,no,yes,"Note 5 was a huge disappointment. The reason I like the note series is its versatility. With expandable storage, huge removable battery and large screen it was a productivity tool- not a toy. Note 5 is a toy. Samsung is copying Apple without an understanding of Note customer base."
yes,yes,no,Don't listen to the doubters. They don't have the phone. I was one of the people who complained about it lacking micro sd and removable batteries. I said I'll never buy this phone because Samsung was going away from power users. Well guess what? This phone destroys all previous Notes.
yes,yes,yes,Execellent every thing i wanted
no,no,no,"Beware of very poor customer support. There are 2 ways to reach support: - chat ; - phone. Both are pretty useless beyond what is on their cheat-sheet. Reps unable to find, analyze or control information. This includes floor supervisors-on-duty."
yes,yes,yes,"I split my world between north America and Australia, so I wanted a device that would work in both countries. I purchased the unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note 5 to replace my original Note device (it held up well for 5 years)."
yes,yes,yes,As Expected Great Product.
yes,yes,yes,"The note 5 is a great device the item was delivered and works​ flawlessly on ATT, receiving LTE coverage."
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love this phone....I bought it a month ago and it works well, picture quality it amazing."
no,yes,no,Item came and was prestine on the outside...hut the screen never worked...it comes on but the touch doesnt work...even though its a like new phone i don't think it was checked thoroughly...
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! I love it!!
no,no,yes,"only accessories was in package, seems it was a production error..."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent Phone. Better bettery, processor and features than note 4"
yes,yes,yes,"Todo excelente, el producto cumplió con todo lo publicado"
yes,yes,yes,It doesn't have lte...works as expected but has blackout spots through the out metro areas..
yes,yes,yes,Its is everything I expected
yes,yes,yes,The phone is nice but something is wrong with the battery
no,yes,yes,Always dropping signal. I had a Chinese phone {zte zmax 2) before this phone that had much better WiFi and signal reception and costed a quarter of the price. Very disappointed in this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Disappointed (hence the 4 stars) by the fact that a Euro plug was sent since I think that an adapter from Euro to US should have been included. With that said, the phone so far works well but I cannot say much more as I have not begun to use it extensively."
yes,yes,yes,"For readers, my opinions on this device (ATT 64Gb version) is based off the experiences I had with this device for the passed few days since launch day (Aug 21, 2015). I will continue to update this review in the future."
yes,yes,yes,"I was lucky enough to get this phone before it's official release date. I previously used the Note 4 and was very happy with it. I must admit I was a little skeptical when I found out there was no removable battery, but that worry was quickly put to rest. The 3000 mah battery lasts forever!"
yes,yes,yes,"Note 5 looks very excellent, but I have not used it because of my SIM size not to match it and I shall replace SMI card after I return China next week. thanks"
yes,yes,yes,Yes yes yes!!!!!! I love this! I have been trying to figure out which one to get between the St and note 5. I just had to pick one or never would have gotten one. I am so ooooooo happy with this one. Only thing I didn't know was it needed a Sim card for straight talk. Oops.
yes,yes,no,Been using this for a month. I came from a note 3. I switched because the GPS on the note 3 is awful. The note 5 is the complete opposite! The GPS usually finds itself within 4 seconds and never let's go of the signal. I have never lost service. Overall great device.
no,no,no,The battery lasts only about 5 hours. So for a new product one has to go with the charger to work and every where.Far below my expectations Very frustrating.
yes,yes,yes,It is very versatile 2k display phone. Every aspect of this phone is nice. Even TouchWiz has evolved a lot and got some cool new features. Major downside is the support from Samsung if you have a problem like sending it to them for service like screen replacement.
yes,no,yes,"Long ago fell in love with the phablet idea with the MEGA. 6.3"" galaxy. Then note 2, 3 and now my 2nd 5. Get a glass screen protector. Shows the beautiful screen. This Note 5 is exceptionally well built compared to my previous galaxies."
yes,no,yes,"I bought it and practically the same week they Change the price, a lower off course"
yes,yes,yes,I had been an iPhone user all my life until I finally decided to give Galaxy a try. I have not looked back since. So glad I took the risk and jumped the ship. Had it for a year now - not a single glitch so far. Extremely fast and reliable.
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone but I just can't get past the glass back. It cracks way too easily. I went through 2 of these phones and the glass back just breaks my heart!
yes,yes,yes,It worked great until few mo this later when it went off. I loved the camara though.
no,no,no,SPen doesn't work.
yes,yes,yes,"Slow shipping speed from a third party but I did receive it and it is a great, fast phone and works well in the USA on T-Mobile 4G (not exactly sure if it's considered LTE but I get speeds of up to 22 MBps down and anywhere from 7 to 22 MBps up)."
yes,yes,yes,It is a nice mobile but the one I bought is not pen friendly.No response when using the pen to press some alphabets like the ''n'' and ''o''. Have not been able to figure out why. I also have a samsung laptop that wont upgrade to windows 10 no matter how hard I try.
yes,yes,yes,"After trying to get this phone up and running for some time, It was brought to my attention that the phone is from Australia! It has been one hassle after another and I still cant get it on my plan!!!"
yes,yes,yes,had used all the note series... but this one is beast.. smartphone of the year !!... no comparison at all....
yes,yes,yes,"It's a great phone , no doubts ! But buying it at 53k would be a bad decision ! As Samsung is notorious for dropping its price by at least 10k in 3-6 month of its product release !"
yes,yes,yes,King of all smartphone 2015
no,no,no,Had a very bad experience
yes,no,yes,"Best and worldclass phone. There is no one point against this statement. Only thing i dont like ( not hate) is (not micro sd and removable battery as u guessed), it is the silver color side metal around the black phone( i hv the black one), it sud have been made a black ascent metal."
yes,yes,yes,Amazing fone. Just go for it when you have budget you will never get disappointed
yes,yes,yes,"Got the Note 5 last week and absolutely loving it. I use iphone 6 as my daily driver but needed a second phone as I travel a lot and also like to watch youtube, tatasky etc and wanted a bigger screen than the 4.7 inches on my iphone 6."
yes,yes,yes,Really Glood mobile phone
yes,yes,yes,Bought dis some 7 days ago....amazing mobile..no cons yet people hu r complaining of no ext card slot shud knw 1 thing dat Samsung is giving us 100gb of free online storage thru Microsoft drive n trust me guys I have used 128 gb of Asus phone n it made me even more lazy so dat I kept storing more n...
yes,yes,yes,Best product loved ittttttttg seriously :) and now its depends on u giys whts your heart wants..
yes,yes,yes,Good phone and good value for money. Buy it only if you are an ardent user of S-pen and require highly performant multi-app feature support for creativity. The Samsung pay is yet to be introduced in India.
no,no,no,very poor sound quality often the phone gets hacked
no,yes,no,i really liked its camera and screen clearity feels really premimum in hands.but its very slippery without back covers i have been using its since 3 months and i think the spring in stylus's button lost its elastic nature hence the button is note working properly and once i forced the upside down...
no,no,no,"This phone has serious known issues. Touch not work with fingers, screen shows lines. This problem not covered under warranty as told by Samsung service."
yes,yes,yes,"Great mobile by Samsung Galaxy, TouchWiz is amazing."

yes,yes,yes,"PROS --Great aesthetic with curves on the back for small bump up in handling -Stellar Quad HD display -Wonderful performance -4GB RAM -Fingerprint reader performs very well -FAST charging almost makes up for standard battery size -S Pen streamlined, physically and in feature set (Clicky top!"
yes,no,yes,"The combo of Exynos 7420 chipset, ultra-sharp Super AMOLED display, and speedy memory should hardly catch anyone by surprise. Dropping the memory card slot and the removable battery from the Note5 specs surely raises eyebrows - Both hardware features have been a staple for the product family since..."
yes,yes,yes,"EASY TO HANDLE, BATERY BACK UP IS LOW AS EXPECTED, BUT OVER ALL GOOD 1"
yes,no,yes,"Excellent phone. Superb battery back up. I actually had a feeling that battery may not last long. But contrary to that, battery last very well. Processor, screen, camera, display everything is just awesome. Loving it."

yes,yes,yes,I bought the product from the nearest showroom the phone is just awesome
yes,yes,yes,"Just bought it today, still fiddling around. I have used the first note and have looked and felt the later versions as well but this one is different. It's is much classier and for some reason it doest feel like a big phone. Samsung has done a amazing job with the built quality."
no,no,yes,"Samsung is going down.Year by year sales declining.Even though they wont learn.This is going to be another flop.No memory card slot,No removable battery,And VERY FRAGILE....wait wait before buying price will become half in 3 months"
yes,yes,yes,It is awesome mobile which we see in this century. Go ahead with this mobile as no one is giving that much function even iphone
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased this phone from local dealer and i am very happy with the device. This device is not for those who have high memory requirement, Else everything is top notch(Camera, Performance, Multitasking, Battery)."
yes,yes,yes,Is note 5 supports OTG ?
yes,yes,yes,It's a amazing phn don't go for the bad reviews. I used s6 edge before this and this is a true iphone 6s plus killer with amazing the only con is samsung is not sending my wireless charger otherwise phn is good and the battery works for m 1 full day with high usage.
yes,yes,yes,Hiì bought it from samsung showroom..fantastic phone..awsum batterry back up..lightning charging..touch is fantafabulous..speakers phone ♥♥♥ loudness is excellent. Golden colour gives royal feeling..was a bit confused either to go for apple or note 5..glad i chuz the right choice.
yes,yes,yes,"Finest note ever produced .. I am using note series from note 1 .. note 5 is amazing all the controls in one hand , much more useful camera and stylus. Practically I am not missing the removal battery and mmc as .. iPhone made me adjusted with cloud memory ."
yes,yes,yes,I used to hate samsung phones. But believe me this BEAST is one piece of hell. Amazing device. Beats nexus and iphones easily. Hope this beast does not get price reduction soon. Coz it's not worth price drop.
no,no,no,Very very poor phone card slot no . 32gb show memory 20gb
yes,yes,yes,"I hv taken from my own shop. Beautiful and fast android phone for android phone users ( do not know abt apple users ). Nice software , hardware , look ..sound .. Camera is awesome... Touch is amazing. . All in one .. Price is too high :( . No phone is perfect .."

no,no,no,Why Would I hate Samsung. Simple fact. They did to Apple was worst. Competing against apple was worst thing to do. Now Micromax doing same to Samsung in mid range phones. Second thing. Price Actualization. They won't listen to you at all. Guys this people will never help you out when you buy.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent. Performance, looks"

yes,yes,yes,"I have been using this product for about a week now and i find this one is worth it. Samsung has come a long way from yesteryears, when its phones were easily the most unappealing plastic hunks on the market. Its efforts to create more premium-looking devices is evident in this version."
yes,yes,yes,Phone is really good but lack external sd card is backward option. I won't buy this bcz of lack expandable memory.
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful handset. ..friendly use and all futures in one phone. ..

yes,yes,yes,"Pros: Great battery life, almost 1.5 times than s6 and equal to iphone 6 plus(my previous phone). Amazing looks, this phone is definitely a head turner. The ability to use the stylus on the locked screen is really helpful. Build quality is much better than the previous generation notes."

yes,yes,yes,"What is wrong with this company (Samsung) ? Just 1 colour option ? Gold? Are you serious ? You really expect all your conservative business buyers to flash around a Gold colours phone? Please get real. After deciding to spend a kings ransom, at the least we can expect to get a colour choice."
yes,no,yes,It has a gear vr yay!!! Its a best feature for note 5...disappointed with samsung for not giving expandable memory support.
no,yes,yes,My SPen didnt work. screen developed purple patch... surely not the kind of issues i would like to see in a flagship phone

no,yes,no,Genuine Review after 2 weeks used.. Worst mobile ever in the view of pricing.. Nothing new features instead of a HD screen and s pen. Can compare it with lenovo vibe k5 note which has the same features at much reasonable price coolpad note 3
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is awesome and works better than expected. I have been a Note 2 user and am simply loving the ease of using the stylus (even with tempered glass screen protector). It is much better in making sense of my hand written notes - no matter how badly written the words are, somehow it can..."

yes,yes,yes,The S Pen is the most amazing thing in this phone. I am a Note series fan and this phone is the best by far...........
yes,yes,yes,"Bought on 20th Sep, had only one doubt in mind before getting my hands on it and that was battery backup, as S6 Edge had not too good battery backup. But i am very happy after seeing my Note5 still breathing with 2% still left while writing this review."

yes,no,yes,I constantly make fun of my friends galaxy s7 because of my superior screen and photo quality its a one sided arguement make the right choice
yes,yes,yes,This review is for someone comparing this to the larger iPhone 6S Plus. My thoughts after 5 months heavy usage as a work phone. Note: I also have the iPhone 6S Plus as a personal phone. This will be my last Samsung/Android device.
yes,yes,yes,EXCELLENT PHONE !! WORKS GREAT ON AT&T NETWORK IN THE U.S.!!
yes,yes,yes,This phone is a beast!! Everything ok with the shipping.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is sexy in the Sliver Titanium color and people will notice it as it is a rare color for the Note 5. Good quality photos, and calls sound great. Videos looks amazing in this Super AMOLED display."
yes,yes,yes,I am very happy with my phone and Tecchnomaster's quick response to my email. Thank you :)
yes,yes,yes,My daughter loves it unlike other phones I have bought in the past I'm very pleased and thank you
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is really good overall but it is not compatible with T-Mobile. Sprint and T-Mobile are the only companies right now who have WiFi enabled calling on their Note5. Apparently, unless you by from them outright, you will not have this feature on your phone."
yes,yes,yes,"this phone works great, i love not having all the extra features at&t preloads that you can't take off. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves the larger screen phones. battery lasts me through the day on moderate use and charges quickly if needed"
yes,no,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy Note line of smartphones are already known for their quality, appearance and functionality. This one is no different. I am very impressed by the new Android 6 OS on this phone and the camera."
no,yes,yes,Ordered this phone. Package was delivered and then I open the box and everything is in there EXCEPT the phone.
no,no,no,THIS MY SECOND NOTE 5..I DON'T LIKE IT SOUNDS OR VERY BAD
no,yes,no,the box said silver but i got a navy blue one. also i had to reformat the phone a couple of weeks in. no problem since.
yes,yes,yes,I like the product
yes,yes,yes,"Long time note fan. Not disappointed. With OTG storage not having an sd card option doesn't bother me as much as i thought it would. The phone looks and feels quality, is quick and powerful, but the best feature is this super snappy camera. Holy cow."
yes,yes,yes,It's great! Thanks!
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone.. super happy with it.
yes,yes,yes,Two items missing from previous models: SD card support and the IR blaster for controlling media devices. Otherwise I would have given it a 5 star rating.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone!!! Love Love Love!!!!
yes,yes,yes,Note 5 is a classical android phone. The phone is being formatted to suit users needs
yes,yes,yes,Super good service 10 out of 10
yes,no,yes,"I bought 2 of these unlocked phone for the hubs and me. Let me tell you these phones are awesome, we use them on the metro network and they work great."
yes,yes,yes,"So sleek, a BIG & GREATER experience when moving from the Windows phone"
yes,yes,yes,It's everything I want n a phone
yes,yes,yes,"good purchase overall. still checking battery life,but performance is a beast, i never have a phone that boot up in 5 second! that is insane!"
yes,yes,yes,Awesome screen resolution! Perfect details and color. But without external sd-card it's not totally perfect. Everything else is excellent!
yes,yes,yes,Was exactly what i was lookin for.
yes,yes,yes,"Be very careful purchasing this if you are using AT&T. The signal quality is severely degraded with this model. For example using a AT&T Note 5 I'd get full signal. Using this model, (in the same location) I'd 1 bar or no bars."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I don't have any issue. Great product from BREED
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone it dose more then you could possibly need your phone to do And it has premium apps that are free You got to buy it
yes,yes,yes,Got it on time and works great! I was a little skeptical but so happy once I got my phone delivered.
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased this phone because I didn't want a contract and it seemed like a nice upgrade. The phone works fine but coming from an S5 I fond myself questioning some of its missing features. I can live without waterproofing, but no IR blaster and no SD card was hard to swallow."
yes,yes,yes,"Works perfectly in Argentina. I'm using Personal and the LTE network got me 0 troubles. The box say ""FOR AMERICAS ONLY"" but I didn't need the USA sim to make it work."
yes,yes,yes,No comment just love it! Pretty brilliant colors in the display!
yes,yes,yes,Item was as stated...very pleased. Thankyou.
no,no,yes,Item had slight damage A small crack that eventually led to a bigger crack. I was desperate for a phone upon receiving my package so I didn't think the slight damage (appeared to be small corner screen crack) would lead to fatal damage.
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone except I haven't figured out how to put the keyboard on swype but that is not the phone's fault. It has a lot of cool features
yes,yes,yes,network is not full I do not know why but the apparatus is as described
no,no,yes,Phone is being flaky after only a month. Called samsung warranty service and found out this is an INTERNATIONAL version so it has a different process to go through. I don't know what the real difference is except that they do not have as good of a warranty.
yes,yes,yes,I was always user apple and I think the note series is much better than iphone. This is true for all who love productivity.
no,no,no,this is not a usa phone even though it is said so in the product description.It got exposed when we try to install samsung pay. samsung pay doesnt work because not a USA phone. someone responded back after talking to samsung guys that this phone is a europe phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I wish I could be like some, and write a spectacular review with the details. I'm coming from having the S3; now I have the Note 5 I love it!! I'm a picture person, camera on here off the chain!!! of course I have to get use to using it, since the S3 didn't have it. but overall so far so good."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing! Can't beat the price either
yes,no,yes,"Beautiful and powerful. The packaging and box were a little banged up, most likely from shipping. It seemed as if the phone box was opened previously, but the phone is still wonderful and great with at&t"
yes,yes,yes,The best phone hands down. Feature after feature. I hardly use my laptop anymore
no,no,no,Could not work for 4g. ..as one post on . Only the 3G work for..network. Been called to seller on review..Been whole month can not get a response. .what is the problems. .???? Need a help??
no,yes,yes,-Update: 2/23/16- The thumb sized unresponsive circle on the screen has resolved itself but there is no telling if the issue will pop up again so I am putting the rating at 3 stars for now. The device works well other than this issue with the screen/S Pen
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone and got it a day early!! Couldnt be happier with it. Fast transfer from straighttalk from my galaxy s4. Very nice upgrade.*this is an update from having the phone for a little more than a week, my service is only running 0.05 mbps best download and 0.03 upload with my ping at 63."
no,no,no,Does not work for sprint or Verizon so this isn't an actual unlocked phone. This is not a US model as well.
no,yes,yes,I absolutely love the phone but I don't like that every time I text it says messages stopped working n shuts down the messages.. N I don't get a lot of my messages because of this... Is my phones defected or something?
no,yes,yes,"BEWARE!! I purchased this phone in December and I've babied this phone to the point where I would leave it in a plastic box when not in use. All of a sudden about a week ago, Phone has been acting really strange."
yes,yes,yes,"When my LG g4 got broken I decided to upgrade to this one. I honestly tried to make me love this phone but ended returning it and purchasing LG g4 again as it was an ideal phone for me, though it doesn't have a stylus."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first note. I had an s6 and let me tell you that it's been a great improvement. it comes with less bloatware. The pen works lovely, is a magnificent tool. It's a charm to hold in the hand. The fingerprint sensor works smoothly."
yes,yes,yes,"Its a great phone to have... but unfortunately most of the NOTE 5 devices I suppose(checked on web) has a drastic issue with WiFi connectivity, sometimes it connects to the router but no internet connectivity. It works with few but, mostly doesn't."
yes,yes,yes,very good phone. really fast
yes,yes,yes,This is literally the nicest phone I have ever owned! It was extremely easy to set up - I have cricket so I just had to go to a store and they gave me a new SIM chip (since my old one was too big) and got everything working within 10 minutes.
yes,yes,yes,Like new and works great!
yes,yes,yes,The purchased was responsible and gave excellent support
yes,yes,yes,Works great can't complain.
no,no,no,Had problems with receiving calls.The LCD stopped working and i had to get it replaced
yes,yes,yes,Phone looks and works brand new i love it
yes,yes,yes,No me llega el producto...???
yes,yes,yes,It a little unique computer in a pocket. I love it very much.
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone. Gets updates much faster than US based phones. Unfortunately, Samsung Pay doesn't work on it, but no big loss. The Note 5 is to me the best Adroid phone in history. The ability to take notes, etc; is wonderful. Long live the s-pen!"
yes,yes,yes,"I'm still learning the features and functions but t's a great phone, I like the size, its easy to view and operatue and it takes great pictures. We Love Love Love our new Samsung Galaxy Note 5 phones."
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good. Size. I come from an iPhone 5 and the bigger size at least to me didn't mean a problem, just switched and done. It's big but fit my pockets. Typing. Good for 2 hands more accurate due to the bigger screen, for 1 hand typing I recommend swiping and solved. Camera. Awesome performance."
yes,yes,yes,"Just ""P.E.R.F.E.C.T."" for those who love this titanium silver model. : )"
no,no,yes,Does not have not have pre installed wifi calling feature for my T-Mobile service. Evidently you can only get the wifi calling feature if you buy the Note 5 directly from T-Mobile. So much for unlocked phones in the U.S.
yes,yes,yes,"Got here on time, packaged great. Works beautifully, love it so much."
yes,yes,yes,Good phone very fast still working well with mm upgrade
no,no,no,Doesn't work with Verizon
yes,no,no,"It's a complete oh phone! (if you are worry about the battery, you won't have any problem - the battery have lasted me all day long, close 15 to 20hours)"
yes,yes,yes,"Unlike the other Samsung Galaxy Notes, the Note 5 shines with an aluminum frame and Gorilla Glass 4 on the front and back. The display is a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED unit with QHD resolution. The 4Gb Ram increases the performance of this device."
yes,no,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is a phablet that now has a premium look and feel. It has a 5.7-inch display, a far better camera than its predecessors, a super-fast processor and also the iconic S Pen stylus which is joined by a new, glass-and-metal design."
yes,no,yes,"Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is the latest generation of models made by Samsung Note. Of course, bringing a number of improvements from the previous Note. But still maintain their advantage in providing digital drawing media."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone. Very happy.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone but must be noted, my Samsung app store software thinks im in Australia and so I can't use Samsung pay because it will only accept Australian cards..."
yes,yes,yes,"PROs + operation speed noticeably higher than Note 4 + great build quality (but very fragile) + improved camera (better image quality, must faster start and stop) + significantly faster loading speed of photos and videos + models SM-N920CD, N920C, N920F, N920K, and N920S support UMTS LTE Band B3,..."
yes,yes,yes,Out of this world
yes,yes,yes,Present for my wife she really loves this
yes,yes,yes,Just WOW!!!!! Popped in my EE SIM card and off I went. No problems at all.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome smartphone! High quality! Strongly recommended! !
no,no,no,My first Samsung product. As this wasn't available in the UK I decided to import it. It came from Hong Kong and is a GSM unlocked model. It was tricky finding out if it would actually work with my sim card as I has read many horror stories online.
yes,yes,yes,"A truly beautiful device on the exterior and a physical powerhouse under the hood, truly blown away by this phone, definately a worthy successor to the note line"
yes,yes,yes,"Such a beautiful phone. Stunning display and superfast functionality thanks to the 4gb RAM. I was debating whether to get this or the Note 4 (my previous phone being a Galaxy S5), because of the fact that the Note 5 doesn't have expandable memory or a removable battery."
yes,yes,yes,came on time as expected does the job. thanks for the team
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone. very impressed with the battery life.. previously i had to charge my old phone atleast twice a day but that's not a thing of the past. the screen is absolutely clear and 4GB RAM , the phone is just too fast. Love it."
yes,yes,yes,Its a dud with no proper support like everything samsung makes.
yes,yes,yes,just makes my life better :)
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. I was also anxious about ordering one when not available in the uk, but it came with a UK plug, and has worked flawlessly. The phone is superb. Really pleased."
yes,yes,no,i had a note 5 from ebay got it in the timescale. but when i went to set it up that's when it all happened to go wrong.i have had a note3 for a few years and gave me no problems in any way whatsoever.the note 5 just stop working could not open or closed it in anyway at all.eventually it came on by...
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone! Super sleek and fun to use!
yes,yes,yes,Love the product
yes,yes,yes,Very good. Really enjoying the note 5
yes,yes,yes,"PROs + operation speed noticeably higher than Note 4 + great build quality (but very fragile) + improved camera (better image quality, must faster start and stop) + significantly faster loading speed of photos and videos + models SM-N920CD, N920C, N920F, N920K, and N920S support UMTS LTE Band B3,..."
no,yes,yes,Good quality about materials and design. But still it's an android phone. The way they're developing this so is getting only worse
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone i am a note 3 user and this is the much better version of an already great phone Great Service the wait was worth it, all the way from london to the canary islands, good package too. Thanks!"
yes,yes,yes,This a truly fantastic phone. I updated front galaxy s 4 the difference is unbelievable. It is clear sharp and quick. It is slightly larger than s4 but I don't mind that. The pen function is soon cool. I don't need note book in handbag any more.
yes,yes,yes,5* from me thank's
yes,no,yes,"I bought it as new, but it seems like the case is opened already."
no,yes,no,After a couple of days from buying this device and very light use I get errors coming up that it fails to read my Sim cards. Samsung refused to replace it although it was a faulty device from the manufacturer. Worst experience of my life and would never deal with Samsung again.
yes,yes,yes,"I started with Note 2 and then 2 years I used Note 3 and I saw no reason to buy Note 4. However, I am very happy with my new Nout 5 (1 month use). There are at least three reasons for joy: a really great camera with optical stabilization and possibility shooting in DNG, great sound (during a..."
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone absolutely love it. One of the best phones ever. looks so good too. 5 STAR phone!
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung fail, I have had every note in the series, and this note 5 is a mistake, looks nice, but you need replacement battery and micro sd card, plus 32gb is a joke to have inside.... pitched as a business phone??"
yes,yes,yes,The look and feel of this phone is great feels very premium in the hand. Fantastic screen vibrant with colours that just pop if you into amoled your in for a treat. I'm on Ee in the Uk no problem with reception 3g or 4g with normal cellular just fine.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is almost a perfect phone for anyone born in the 1980s and into sci-fi. I dreamt of a device not far from the Note 5. I have the Hong Kong dual sim edition in frivolous gold. It mostly surpasses the Note 3, which I swapped for this and I imagine the Note 4 for similar reasons."
no,no,yes,Would be 5 stars but battery pretty much drops to 99% as soon as off charge.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is noy being sold in the UK, and when i found it on here I was a bit worried I would be sent a replica one, but I recieved the original one and I have been using it for four months now. I highly recommend it!"
yes,yes,yes,Agree with most people here. Great phone in terms of speed and camera. S-note is slightly watered down so previous fans are puzzled. My guess is a small sacrifice in order to gain speed and save space (since no Micro SD port).
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy Note 5 is certainly beautiful. Its design and the materials used means it feels like a more premium device than its predecessors in the series, but it has lost a few typical Note features."
yes,yes,yes,Love mine. Love Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is perfect, just don't have Russian language, which is unusual."
yes,no,yes,"Very good. The only thing is the battery. The only thing that I would criticize so far is that the battery does not last all day with severe usage, and as has only 3000 mh is a theme to remember at the time of purchase. Samsung i believe did not succeed this time in this issue."
yes,yes,yes,Legit honest straight and fast . Thumbs up
yes,yes,yes,Nice one and fast! you can do many things on it.
no,yes,no,Has the name Olleh on the back... disappointed!
yes,yes,yes,Love it! I was satisfied with my purchase
yes,yes,yes,"Why is this so cheap, I want to order lots and lots"
no,no,no,Received 9208 instead but should work everywhere I expect to travel the coming years.
yes,yes,yes,Really great super product. Just battery was short so I tried to tune it. Took a bit of time then finally discovered that the biggest drain comes from the google voice command that drains the battery and avoids the system to go to full sleep.
yes,yes,yes,"Really nice phone, beautiful color, really fast. Very good buy."
yes,yes,yes,"Got the samsung note 5 and found out its knoxed. Still works, but not to happy that it was sold while knoxed. Meaning that it cant use any samsungs own features. Once its knoxed it loses that. It should have been noted in the sale."
yes,yes,yes,The phone worked as expected.
yes,yes,yes,"Was for my mom, she said it was a perfect phone. Everything works no problems. She said it was a good deal!"
yes,yes,yes,It's a good phone and in condition as well. Also the rest of the items below are owesome
yes,yes,yes,"For readers, my opinions on this device (ATT 64Gb version) is based off the experiences I had with this device for the passed few days since launch day (Aug 21, 2015). I will continue to update this review in the future."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Played with it at the Samsung Unpacked event Pros: Super Fast S pen is more accurate Quad Hd res display is very good especially outdoors Cons No sd No removable battery
yes,yes,yes,"Very good product. Almost perfect. Its just lacking ONE LTE frequency...and of course the one I need for my carrier ...if you are using VODAFONE, be aware that the 800 mhz band is blocked. (Samsung loves to do stuff like that!)"
no,yes,no,After a couple of days from buying this device and very light use I get errors coming up that it fails to read my Sim cards. Samsung refused to replace it although it was a faulty device from the manufacturer. Worst experience of my life and would never deal with Samsung again.
yes,yes,yes,"Lightweight, thin, slightly smaller case than the Note 4 but the screen is the exact same size. Samsung has packed a lot of features into this phone. It has two sim slots so I am able to have two phone numbers on one phone. I love the gold color."
yes,no,yes,The product is great. However it easily flips from English to Korean? language when you are texting. This can be annoying. I think once the language of choice is selected it should be difficult for any other language to be accessed easily.
yes,yes,yes,Loving my phone more each day. It is my very first smart phone and prior to it I never felt I needed one and now I would never want to be without it.
no,yes,yes,My phone was dead out of the box. It wouldn't take a charge. Never would power on. Quality control for this product must be very lacking. When you pay this amount of money for a phone you expect great quality.
no,no,no,"The charger didnt work, I suppose that it meant to work on China, and the language is on Chinese too, not so hard to change to english though, the cellphone excelent!"
yes,yes,yes,This is simply a great phone. The materials used give it a solid good quality feel. The dual sim functionality is easy to use and adds to what is already good hardware and software. The camera is easy to use and produces a beautiful picture.
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone, it exceed my expectations and is working fine, totally satisfied!"
yes,yes,yes,"I am very pleased with this phone. It has almost replaced my tablet. Photos very impressive. Battery life quite good compared to my previous phone, the Galaxy 5. I think I will stay with the Galaxy note in future."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung did it again! The smartphone of the year! I purchased this Gold Platinum colored Note 5 from the T-mobile Online store. Coming from a Note 3 with 32 GB memory, this Note 5 is just as great as the 3 but with a better built frame and body, faster internals and a outstanding 2-K resolution..."
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I've seen to date! great photos...
no,yes,yes,"Phone mobile data did not work, apn setting were double and triple checked. NGP kept $90 of my money claiming the phone worked just fine. Stay far away from NGP store they are crooks."
yes,yes,yes,"wife couldn't like w/out it!,it doing great..."
no,no,no,I cannot connect to.lte
yes,yes,yes,It was a gift....the recipient loves it.
no,yes,yes,"Out of the box, this phone touchscreen NEVER worked! Only using the pen works on the screen. Emailed seller and no response to date! DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!"
yes,no,yes,Excellent service! I previously had a Galaxy Note 5 from T-Mobile but I had to return it because I use to travel a lot and I needed an unlocked phone. The Galaxy Note 5 in White Pearl unlocked is not available online (because of National Backorder) so I found this Dual Sim Card International Version...
yes,yes,yes,Best version so far. I love it.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, I live in Dominican Republic and works very well with the two main operators Orange and Claro here."
yes,yes,yes,"Very good phone with state of the art design and performance. However, quite fragile, slippery hold (you need to by a skin or case if you don't want to lose it) and close to non-resistant at all to any water exposure."
yes,yes,yes,PERFECT! LOVE THE PHONE!
yes,no,yes,The great Samsung Quality as usual. However I wish the battery could be removed and there was a slot for a memory card.
yes,yes,yes,Lost a star cause the top of my stylus popped off... other than that i love this phone but without my stylus i feel slightly handicapped
yes,yes,yes,I bought these as gifts and was told exactly what was wanted and the features. My family is happy.
no,yes,yes,Do you have a Gold color ? It is two sim card ?
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my new pink Samsung galaxy note5 phone; I'm definitely very satisfied!
yes,no,yes,"The only think I don't like about it is that it's a fingerprint magnet, but for me, it's still worth the 5 star rating for my usage."
yes,yes,yes,Extremly fragil.
yes,yes,yes,present for my wife. she loves it.
no,yes,no,"I absolutely loved this phone, brand new, did what it was supposed to do, THEN ATT did away with 2G and it is now a single sim phone as you can not activate both sims in 3G or 4G. It automatically selects 2G for the second line making one sim unusable if your provider does not offer 2G."
yes,yes,yes,Works superb Very good conditions
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with product. Dont be alarmed. Coming fro. Taiwan, it comes in taiwanese. Easily fixed to english."
no,yes,yes,"This product is very nice for the price but I really don,t know if this is a China version because when I open it first there were Chinese writings at the beginning and some of the things I try to access is in Chinese language."
yes,yes,yes,This is a beautiful device. I had the Verizon branded Note 5 before trading it for a Note 7 (rip). The silver on this device isn't obnoxious. Both sim slots work with AT&T and T-mobile LTE bands in the US. This device takes beautiful photos.
yes,no,yes,I feel I still have a note 4. The only thing I gained is another slot for an extra sim
yes,yes,no,"Smartphone, absolutely faulty. Battery, under very little usage, lasts very littlle; Firmware upgrade to 6.0.1 made the phone very unstable. Over-heating, connectivity issues, particularly when on auto-switch from WIFI to 3/4G or vice-versa, line dropping, not able to be heard while on a phone call."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent !!!! super happy with this phone
yes,yes,yes,Fast. Good cameras. Lot of room for apps. Not noticing tje significant warming of the instrument as my past experences with past models.
yes,yes,yes,"It was a gift for my brother, he loved it!!!"
yes,yes,yes,I LOVE THE DUAL SIM
yes,yes,yes,All was in order and working great
yes,yes,yes,Daughter got it to replace dying phone. Was here the next day. She lives off her phone.
yes,yes,yes,products exactly as descriped
no,yes,yes,The only backdraw is that this is the international veesion and some features don't work with it. Also samsung pay is not supported :(
yes,no,yes,"I love my note, but i bought this one so that i could have a work number and personal number on the same phone. Since i use the same provider as my work, dual sims did not work. You have to use sims from different providers."
yes,yes,yes,"I own this phone. The best you can get compares with all other brands now. Camera is perfect, Phone is Fast, no lag, no problems at all. The 1 star comment of the other person doesnt make sense."
yes,yes,yes,"PROs + operation speed noticeably higher than Note 4 + great build quality (but very fragile) + improved camera (better image quality, must faster start and stop) + significantly faster loading speed of photos and videos + models SM-N920CD, N920C, N920F, N920K, and N920S support UMTS LTE Band B3,..."

no,yes,no,Returned bc it wouldn't pick up where I live!
no,yes,no,"I bought this 14 months ago.. I was relatively happy up until I went to bed one night and woke up with it dead. Didn't drop it anytime recently. Didn't get water damage, or heat damage."
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone and the price was excellent. Use it with Straight Talk.
yes,yes,yes,Still think that Samsung innovations are great and got this one over Christmas. Loving it so far. And I appreciate that they admitted their mistake and conducted investigations.
no,no,no,Dose this work for prepaid? Or Altell?
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful. Smooth. Fast. Quality.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this for my Dad for his birthday. Not much different than the Note 3 except the picture and video quality is A++, especially in low light conditions."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone,even without the removable battery and expandable storage. I bought the 920i model for Europe - works all the bands form the main carriers (except 4G band 20 - but no longer used by my operator - so i didn't mind). The phone comes without any bloatware - so great."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, best Samsung Device so far. Sucks thats theres not storage slot, but performance is just great."
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone, brand new, no problems"
yes,no,no,"Notice: I purchased the Samsung Note 5 64gb through my carrier, AT&T. The Note 5 is an upgrade from the Blackberry Z10. But before I upgraded to the Note 5, I had upgraded to the Priv, but returned the Priv and exchanged it with the Note 5."
yes,yes,yes,"I love it, haven't had any problems with it and it works great with Straight talk!"
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely in love with this phone!!

yes,yes,yes,It a very good cellphone and the package delivered very good and safe
yes,yes,yes,"I hope you solve the problem, excuse my behavior I was just a little frustrated."
yes,yes,yes,"Overall that is a good phone. Solid battery life, great camera and amazing screen. Screen is definitely improved over last generation, bright and crisp. Battery gives you enough juice to last the whole day, but I'm sure it will get weaker over months and unfortunately battery is non removable."
yes,yes,yes,A great phone with a lot of options.
no,yes,no,I expected a better device functions The device some times send the SMS other times it fails Even when I have changed my SIM card The camera some time does not work so I restart the device again
yes,yes,yes,The note5 phone is perfect. And its original one make by Samsung. Thanks for that
yes,yes,yes,Had this device for a short time... but already I am loving it. I'm not gonna do a detailed review here because there's already a million of them online... so for specifics and details check out YouTube for great review videos. What I will point out is that this is the international version...
yes,yes,yes,Okay phone. (I am always critical of my phones). I just wish it had an expandable memory & replaceable battery & an infra-red signal so I can use it as a remote control like my old Samsung galaxy 4 phone. Screen and camera are quite awesome and it has a fast processor.
yes,yes,yes,"Love, love, love my phone. Best place to get a phone if you don't want to be committed to a contract."
yes,yes,yes,"Decided to upgrade my Note 3 to a 5. It is nice having the tap'n'pay facility on the phone. It is slightly thinner and lighter than the Note 3. I also bought the wireless charger since the 5 has the facilties builtin. Other than that, I have no problems at all and am very happy with the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I have been with Samsung since they released the Galaxy Nexus, and Galaxy S3. When I first saw a note phone I couldn't imagine why anyone would buy such a huge phone. Then I tried the note 2. And I adored it. It had so many great features and overall amazing phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I replaced my ipod, and my ipad with this terriific item! I keep discovering amazing new things that it does. Absolutely love it!"
no,no,yes,"It is not internal version (as it's description )at all, AT &T version couldn't be used outside America."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought it only since this may. N now, it cannot get out of the thing call reboot loop. The best phone fixing in geneva that the model is not good so all i can do is either to buy a new one or let the guy put another model inside my phone. I love the phone so much."
yes,yes,yes,"All is well, no problem 's so far"
yes,yes,yes,My daughter likes it so much even though she initially thought she ordered the dual sim phone. She enjoyed the phone. Thanks...
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent product at very low price, I am more than satisfied with my purchase."
no,yes,yes,This product came with build in big where YouTube video and audio become out of sync after watching for few minutes. Got this one replaced. New piece works properly.
yes,yes,yes,"wonderful team , I love its functionality"
no,no,yes,Unlocked features
yes,yes,yes,"Gorgeous phone. Not sure why iPhones are so much more expensive. Time will tell as we have both in the family. I have a 7 plus, and got this for my daughter. I'm a little jealous. The gold is stunning."
yes,yes,yes,Phone is pretty good only thing wrong with it is that the s pen don't really write as long as u put pressure on to it. Another thing is when I play any type of music or video on YouTube it just randomly stops. But other than that it's a good phone
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is unlocked working fine here in Zambia, Africa using my local service providers with no problem. It is looking very good and it almost new. They sent me a great product. I would recommend it to others looking for this kind of phone."
no,yes,yes,The adaptive fast charging does not work.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm a Note 4 ""power user"". One who uses the phone heavily on jobsites to do site surveys and other adulty things. I also love my Note 4 for the nerd in me. An obsession with tech paired with a hobby of reviewing I find myself with some geeky stuff."
yes,yes,yes,Big fan of android and Samsung note. Loved this phone. I use it like a substitute to PC and
yes,yes,yes,Snoozer options and different ringtone options for callers/ contacts = unhappiness on note 5. Note 4 had options. I just upgraded for more memory.
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned the Note 3 for the past two years and LOVE IT! And my family also have different Samsung models and love their phones. After seeing the initial specs on the Note 5, I figured it was time for an upgrade and ordered the Note 5 from my carrier. To my surprise, NO MICROSD SLOT! Wow."

yes,yes,yes,"The phone works perfectly, however, I did not receive a sim card tray pin with my device and my s-pen was chewed at its end point."
yes,yes,yes,I strongly recommend ordering from these people. I ordered 2. Mine had a minor glitch but they worked with me 100% and quick. I can't complain. I'm happy with my galaxy note 5 and so is my husband. THANK YOU!!!
yes,yes,yes,Need book on how to operate note 5 did not come with book ! Help !!!
yes,yes,yes,"For readers, my opinions on this device (ATT 64Gb version) is based off the experiences I had with this device for the passed few days since launch day (Aug 21, 2015). I will continue to update this review in the future."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Played with it at the Samsung Unpacked event Pros: Super Fast S pen is more accurate Quad Hd res display is very good especially outdoors Cons No sd No removable battery. Battery life is 3000 mah which is less than the note 4 Was this review helpful?
yes,yes,yes,"As of today (March 22, 2016) this is the nicest big phone out there. I only put the ""big phone""disclaimer because some folks rightly bristle at the size - it's tougher to operate one-handed. But me? I need a big phone. My eyes aren't great and by thumbs are big - a big phone is a must."
no,no,no,Bad iemi. Had to send back
yes,yes,yes,EVERYTHING CAME AS SAID IN DESCRIPTION. EVEN HELPED WITH QUESTIONS I HAD
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone! I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy s5 to a Note 5. I wanted a bigger phone with more storage. It also takes beautiful pictures! I found it for this great price, read the reviews, and couldn't pass up the deal."
yes,yes,yes,I like the phone everything works
yes,yes,yes,"The best phone ever! I'm a civil engineer and work in Structural Design and my working team is never join together. With this phone, Whatsapp, Gmail, we can do whatever we want to do the right thing on drawings."
yes,yes,yes,"For readers, my opinions on this device (ATT 64Gb version) is based off the experiences I had with this device for the passed few days since launch day (Aug 21, 2015). I will continue to update this review in the future."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm still getting used to a somewhat big phone, but I really like having a big screen. Pros: - Love the stylus - with the S Note app the line sensitivity to pressure is amazing - you can zoom in as well. These two effects allow for awesome drawings."
no,no,yes,Everything is fine except the battery discharges too fast. I get about 8 hours if I'm lucky and not using the phone much. The international version won't work with WIFI calling on AT&T. Won't work with Verizon.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone works great so far, only disappointment was that I was under the impression that the phone was brand new as it stated on the item description but when it arrived the samsung packaging had grease stains, the labeling was obviously tampered with and when I opened it, the phone screen had smudges..."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone I love it.
yes,yes,yes,My wife loves it.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone works great no troubles what so ever until now! updated from a Note 4, the phone is slimmer than past edition. Just have to say i love it!!"
no,no,no,"Ever once in a while it freezes but I have learned how to fix the problem. I switch to another ISP on screen and usually fixed the problem or turn of and on also fixes it. Perhaps this is the nature if this model phone I guess, however my old Samsung never did the same thing as mentioned."
no,yes,no,The charger is of poor quality and does not work. The phone however is great.
yes,no,yes,This was an upgrade from my HTC M1(8) that had been causing some charging issues. Seeing that this unit had the built in wireless charging was an added extra bonus.
yes,yes,yes,"So far it's been very reliable, love the app that activates once the note pen is taken out. Very nice screen resolution. It's fast and camera works great in low light. Only lowdown is no micro SD slot so you only have 32gb internal storage."
yes,yes,yes,"Rpido, liviano y lindo!"
yes,yes,yes,Samsung nunca defrauda! Excelente diseo y velocidad
yes,yes,yes,muy buen producto ..estoy interesado en comprar proximamente un nuevo producto..
yes,yes,yes,La mejor tienda en electrnicos
yes,yes,yes,"I wanted to enjoy this phone but unfortunately it didn't do so well in the phone part. It also had some screen freezes which I was never pleased with. This was just my experience with it, perhaps it works better for you or on a different network."
yes,yes,yes,Pest Price that I could find for what I wanted. It Came quickly and didn't have any issues as of yet.
yes,yes,yes,"I was long overdue for a phone, and i finally took the plunge. This phone is amazing!!!! I love everything about it....."
no,no,no,"I work 10 hours a day traveling cross the country. Within the first 2 hours of my day, the battery is already on 50%! If i wasnt in dire need of a phone, i would have returned it!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the size of the phone and all the features. I still getting used to it so I haven't learned how to group the app yet. Also I don't like that it doesn't have a place to add a memory...i still love this phone the pics are great, and I can watch movies on it too!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"REALMENTE FUI GRATAMENTE SORPRENDIDO CON EL DISEO, LA FACILIDAD DEL MANEJO, LAS PRESTACIONES, ETC"
yes,yes,yes,"My boyfriend just received this phone in the mail yesterday. Packaging, quality was great. Everything was running great. Until he opened Chrome and Browser. Almost ALL of the screen turns black and keep flickering. Same problem with the camera."
yes,yes,yes,"This staff is really beyond my expectation in regards of performance and quality, I was using other type of phone as well but this or Samsung Galexy Note 5 is all ahead one."
yes,yes,yes,THE PHONE IS EXCELLENT WITH THE BATTERY . CAMERA IS VERY GOOD . LOOKS GREAT .
yes,yes,yes,Good Production! Good price!
no,yes,yes,Best phone on the market and all yeah for all you Apple users Apple sucks
yes,yes,yes,"The hardware specifications are really great, second to none in 2015 and at least for early 2016. What makes it less interesting is its software integration. The operation is not as smooth as the Apple's product. Part of the screen can become unresponsive and it occurs randomly."
yes,yes,yes,"I had this phone for a month, I love the built in camera it does almost everything I need. Quality of photo and video is fantastic. Screen is great as expected."
yes,yes,yes,I have moved from a Samsung note 4 to a Samsung note 5 and I'm in love with the phone. The only thing is that the Samsung note 5 doesn't have an external memory slot which is disappointing. Besides that I have no issues with the phone. The camera is pretty amazing!
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, beautiful shape, s-pen works perfectly and the new click feature really makes it feel higher-end. The battery is the only downfall...I barely get 3 hours of use out of it when I am playing games or on the Internet. Otherwise, definitely recommended!"
yes,yes,yes,"I really like this phone. Took some getting used to since I upgraded from a Note 2, but so far I am pleased with it. It was delivered when they said it was going to be and it was in brand new mint condition."
yes,yes,yes,Perfect. Great price. Description described more wear and tare than the phone actual had. It really was closer to brand new. Use it and I love it. Description otherwise was very accurate.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome!!! Exactly as described.
yes,yes,yes,It's just awesome. Very happy
no,no,no,This stylis pen didn't work the Bluetooth came on off phone froze @times so carrier had me turn in pay $175 deductible
yes,yes,yes,"Phone arrived and was in top condition. Using a Samsung app (Smart Switch), all my contacts, messages, got transferred from my old phone (LG G3) to the Note 5. Best switch to a new phone that I've ever had."
no,yes,no,"The phone don't turn on, the sim card slot is missing how am I supposed to use the phone. I contact seller and no answer. This is the worst experience ever. I want my money back."
yes,yes,yes,Phone looks and works great!
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone just wish it had removable memory like previous versions. Battery is good depending how many background apps you have running, Needs a charge after 6 hours of average use. I've had the 2 and the 4, this is way smoother and faster."
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone..great price
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent overall phone. Great battery life and performance combo. S-Pen remains an amazing feature that you don't know how much you need until you try it out. Not sure why so many leave such negative review on the phone itself, just because a Seller has wronged them, know the difference between..."
no,yes,no,The phone took 5 hours to charge and upon sending it back I had issues getting a refund. I wouldn't suggest buying this.
yes,yes,yes,Got excellent service and I love my phone.
no,no,no,I did not receive a 64gb-it was again an error-it was 32gb-the previous one I purchased was broke-I just kept it- I am very dissatisfied
yes,no,yes,Love it if think about buying one for another person works with straight talk Verizon towers
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone. No problems adding it to my plan. Would buy it again in a hot second!
yes,yes,yes,Bought as a present for my wife and she just loves it! Which tickles me to death...
yes,yes,yes,So far so good Only weird thing my cell only plays radio online while connected to the charger.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new Note 5. Everything went smooth and i recieved the phone and packaging in excellent condition and Purple Cobra made life easy, they wrote down the id numbers on a piece of paper and within 15 minutes i had my number transferred over to the new phone. I would buy from these guys again."
yes,yes,yes,Thank you! This is the bestest phone ever!!! I truly enjoy it...
yes,yes,yes,its worked verry good and easy to setup by verizon straigtlak thanks
yes,no,yes,"I have purchased the Samsung Note, Note 2, Note 4 and most recently the Note 5. I do enjoy these phones. I personally think they are easier to use than the iPhone. I would recommend this product."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone was A & Z Tech, and it was great. It looked like new; there are a few cosmetic things - mostly on the side, but otherwise it was exactly as advertised. I am really pleased with this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this used from Edge Cellular, and it has been fantastic. It looked brand new and the gold color is beautiful. It works very well, had it a month and everything is going well. I have had all the note phones starting from one, and have enjoyed them all."
yes,yes,yes,"Great, just what I needed!"
yes,yes,yes,"If you're worried about battery life...don't. First of all, the more powerful smart phones get, the more complaints you'll have about battery life. Plus, depending on your phone settings, screen brightness, and usage battery life can vary."

yes,yes,yes,Great phone! Sooner electronics is Amazing to to business with they take care of their customers
no,yes,yes,"Love the phone however, 2 months after purchased the phone locked up and had to buy another phone. I couldn't find anyone that would unlock the phone even took it to the corporate Verizon store and was advised they do not unlock phones."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone best in class. Photos on this thing are amazing. Best screen for movie watching and reading. Took one star away for the removal of sd card slot. 64GB is just enough storage.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is wonderful, if you're considering it, go for it, it's awesome. However my seller marked my phone as ""like new"" but the phone has scuffs on the corners (literally all four corners) and a scuff on the lock button that makes it feel gummy (no positive click like the volume buttons) and it..."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone! Works great! Everything it was advertised to be
yes,yes,yes,Most of the reviews on here are not verified. I'll skip to the next phone thanks! I dislike when ppl put false reviews out there just to sell their product!
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy Note 5 is working out to be just what I was looking for. As I said in the title for this review the Note 5 is proving to be almost as good as the Note 7 and it's one big feature is that it won't burst into flames in my pocket.
yes,yes,yes,Very please with my purchase considering that the Note 5 is on back order with Samsung and I had to give my Note 7 back. I love the Note product it makes my life easier!!
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome! As promised condition,...with a piece of mind of being able to return within 30 days! Thanks!"
yes,yes,yes,I bought a note 5 with a sprint contract and it's been blacklisted! Might have been a decent phone if it actually worked with my SIM card.
yes,yes,yes,Could not have asked for a better purchase.. was even better than i expected.. looks and works as a brand new phone.. thanks
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone very much but it is a AT&T phone so I am selling it and going back to Verizon...the girls at work that have a Verizon phone can get connections when I can't...but love the phone
yes,no,yes,I like Note 5 very much. It is beyond my expectation.
yes,yes,yes,I purchased this Note 5 as a gift for my husband who was very skeptical about the larger cell phones. He has admitted now that he was very wrong and he loves loves loves his large phone!
no,yes,yes,"this is a great phone, i went with this note 5 because i lost my note 4. the 5 is a great phone the only problems i have had are that the phone can be glitchy and slow at times, the battery life dosnt last all day unless you dont use it often, and for that there are no replacement batteries like..."
no,no,no,can this phone work in the Caribbean with any carrier.
yes,yes,yes,"Great device. Only one flaw, the headphones that came with the phone didn't fit in the headphone jack at all. But headphones I've bought previously do fit. Please make sure the headphones fit in the jack for future customers, it was very inconvenient for me."
yes,yes,yes,"I only got the 32gig. I've had it for a little longer than a month and it seems like its slowing down a little bit. I try to keep my files to a minimum and clean storage space. Besides that, the phone it self is perfect. Just wish I got one with more memory."
yes,yes,yes,Received with excellent condition.
yes,yes,yes,Having issues with echoing.
yes,yes,yes,I am impressed every day.
yes,yes,yes,Love my Note 5. Had to upgrade from a Note 2.
yes,yes,yes,"Edge Cellular did an amazing job with this Note5. The phone is excellent. I just came from a Note4 still have it, but couldn't be happier with this Note5 since I couldn't keep the Note7. It's in way better condition than they described and I was expecting, especially since the price was so low."
yes,yes,yes,Could ask for better!!
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. The operating system is more accurate for talk to textend. It is really fast and so far glitch free. I would definitely choose this phone again.
yes,yes,yes,So far I'm very satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy Note 5.
yes,no,no,I did not like it because it did not work
yes,yes,yes,Phone was a brand new refurbish not a mark on it. Well worth the price I paid for it.
yes,no,yes,"A little more scratchex up than it appears in the pictures. I don't know if it was a clever camera angle or some kind of filler to hide the scratches or even if hiding them was purposefully done. But it still is easily four stars, almost five."
yes,yes,yes,"no issues, was as advertised"
yes,yes,yes,Was just as expected. Clean looks like new and works great.
yes,yes,yes,"It works great and isn't a rip off. It had a scratch on the phone though - I guess that's what to expect from a ""used"" item"
yes,yes,yes,"I've always been a fan of Samsung!! This phone has so much to offer, I've had no problems with it and actually use my old Samsung at home to go on the Internet, it's my ""mini laptop!!"""

yes,yes,yes,So far so good... an I order it an it got here in one day... so it made my wife extremely happy... since her phone was broken...
no,yes,no,"Phone is buggy and glitchy, it constantly freezes, and acts funny, GPS spins, all kinds of stuff, definitely not new"
no,no,no,When the company sent it to me it was defective
yes,yes,yes,So far had the phone less than 24 hrs and it's glitches out on me twice I have had to restart the phone. So far not to happy with it. Would recommend lookin at other options.
no,no,no,Stoped working 2 months later
yes,yes,yes,Very nice phone. Like new.
yes,yes,yes,"Power consumption is a bit of an issue, but other than that, it's a good phone"
yes,yes,yes,Great deal. Like new.
yes,yes,yes,Phone is great except that i had to find a sim tray because i didnt recieve one with the phone. And the charge cord broke the first time i used it.
yes,yes,yes,"I really like this phone! The smooth slick case, it came in awesome condition and I was very impressed. This phone is unlocked and the original carrier is Verizon. My carrier is T-mobile and I get a regular pop up on my ntofications screen that says Sim card is not Verizon."
no,no,no,I just bought this phone on 3/13/17 and now my phone won't let me touch it I have to use my S pen. I need an exchange or return asap please
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is completely functional, just a small blemish on the home button. Thumbprint function is great!"
no,no,yes,Already having problems charging
no,yes,no,Recieved phone and Cannot hear phone calls unless on speaker.
no,no,yes,"I need help with my cellphone please I can not log in to my account google asks me for an account of the owner of the cell, it is possible that the previous owner of the cell phone can delete his google account of note 5 please"
yes,yes,yes,The charger is not an original one and it takes about a whole day to fully charge my the Galaxy note.
yes,yes,yes,"love it, better than what i expected"
no,yes,yes,I'm srry that was the wrong address
no,no,no,I was given the wrong color and the wrong carrier. It said it was UNLOCKED for verizon. But ended but being locked with At&t.
yes,yes,yes,Solid phone. Love the features and response. My only negative is the absence of a memory card.
yes,yes,yes,Received my super quick and so far it is beautiful and works flawlessly
no,yes,no,I paid for a new item the box was open and missing the SIM card tool. So I am unsure if I got a new phone or not.
yes,yes,yes,My phone had a few issues but I kept it still
yes,yes,yes,Good phone love it
no,yes,yes,Did not come with original accessories as it said and original box and did not come with a case
yes,yes,yes,I purchased this phone in place of my iPhone Plus 6 of which I hated. This phone is worth every penny. It works as stated and I love it. It is also in excellent condition as stated and came with the original stuff. No issue in activating it with Verizon.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is great, but was not brand new as listed."
no,no,no,"Can i get a tmobile instead of an verizon , i will send back the verizon It will not be able to work in jamaica."
no,yes,yes,"If there was a no star option I would give it that. The phone looks great there was no damages to the actual phone. However this phone does not work, it turns off constantly. The WiFi never works when connected."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm such a big fan of the Note line of Samsung phones so I HAD to get this one. The screen resolution and camera has to be the highlights of this phone...oh and I love the ability to download Themes. My favorite feature is the ""My Places"" widget. I know there's more things on this phone to learn."
yes,yes,yes,Came in really great condition. Works perfectly. Amazing phone.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone itself is great, but the stylus is flimsy. I dropped the phone last week from stomach height and the stylus broke inside of it. It was in a Speck Candyshell case (the one with silicone grips), which protected the rest of the phone perfectly fine."
yes,yes,yes,Love it even though I sure do miss my note 7 ;-(
yes,yes,yes,I bought this as a phone waiting in the wings since Samsung is not making Note 5 phones any longer. This phone came in a different color much to my delight. The color doesn't matter since I keep my phones in a case but I like the black much better than the gold it was supposed to be.
yes,yes,yes,"It's a really nice phone, but battery life could be better. If I leave my house at 6 am with the battery charged at 100 percent, by 5 pm the phone will need to be recharged. If you buy this phone, just make sure you keep your charger with you at all times. Other than that, I'm very happy with it."
yes,yes,yes,I've had every Note in the Note series of phones since the 2nd generation and this is the best one yet. Design I've found this to be one of the best designed phones I've used and I've had most of the flagship phones over the years. It feels incredibly solid and balanced in the hand.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone for a couple weeks now and I've really enjoyed having it. It works well and I've loved having the stylus. Great phone, I recommend it."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, looks and performs like it's brand new."
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome Phone, Works great!"
no,yes,yes,RUN! This guy is a liar and a thief. He has a lease on the phone and can't be used by anyone. Do NOT buy from him no matter what.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent Camera, Phone, Calendar, GPS, ETC..."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone. I purchased the Att version but I have it on Cricket service. I'm really pleased with this device.
yes,yes,yes,little hard to learn
no,no,yes,Phone could not be activated
yes,yes,yes,"Item was just like new, saved me over $300 compared to a new unit, and saved me another $20/month in line fees."
no,no,yes,"With battery technology improving, I was surprised how quickly this phone's internal battery time declined over only six months. The first three months it lasted all day and night under typical use."
no,no,no,Actually no I am very unsatisfied with this because for it being a certified like-new product the charge port does not work properly I have only been able to use the standard slow charging charger because the fast charger does not work unless you apply slight pressure on the charger plug going into...
no,yes,yes,I love this phone. I have had it for 4 months. I use it on straight talk. I have only had one problem with it and that was when the weather got bad something happened to the phone towers and I had to factory reset my phone
no,yes,no,"This device has problems charging, sofware and i can't return it. don't buy"
yes,yes,yes,Works wonderfully. I got this phone a few days before it was suppose to arrive. Thanks!
yes,yes,yes,"Great shape, had a minor scuff on top right hand side of screen, but not really noticable."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone !!! It works real good !!!
yes,yes,yes,Few more scratches than I anticipated but overall great replacement for my phone at a great cost.
no,yes,no,This is by far the worse phone Samsung has come out with the note 5 is just terrible and this is my second one the newest update now makes my phone freeze completely and has shut off numerous amount of times I've been using Samsung since about 2002 and even have the SCH-i519..
yes,yes,yes,Phone arrived in record time. Brand new in box as described. Turned on immediately once I inserted my SIM card. Great people to do business with.
yes,yes,no,"I just got a Note 5. I'm keeping it coz I don't want to deal with the hassle of returning. I didn't like this as much as my Note 4. The screen is slightly narrower than Note 4 but the size says 5.7"". There is no place to insert a micro card for extra storage."
yes,yes,yes,"The arrived arrived in excellent condition, no scratchesq and worked without any issues."
yes,yes,yes,"Super good, minor wear, though broken S Pen, easily fixed with super glue. Lovely phone overall, though"
yes,yes,yes,"It is definitely a used phone with some screen damage however I feel like that was to be expected from the description. It was described having wear and tear however it looks like it could be water damage, but as of now I am happy that it is working."
yes,yes,yes,"This is an awesome piece of design hardware. I love it and although I like the note 3 settings layout more, the 4k camera on this phone used compared to buying a 4k camera as a camera makes it extraordinary value and a great phone."
no,no,no,"I purchased this from Supreme Deals 18, it was listed as an AT&T phone, but unlocked. I was a little concerned when I got the phone because the packaging had no AT&T labeling at all. When I started up the phone, again no AT&T bloatware or ringtones?"
yes,yes,yes,Perfect phone wife loved it
no,yes,no,"I've had the Note 5 for about a year now and it was great for the first couple of months, eventually it stopped holding a charge and now it actually loses power while charging. I've tried multiple cables, clearing cache, factory reset, etc. all to no avail. Never again Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,Great buy only issue can't talk on phone and read emails or view pictures at same time. It works differently then Note 3
no,yes,no,Phone came on time but upon turning it on.. It's pink. It looks like it was dropped in water and kicked around. The phone is horrible.
yes,yes,yes,Love it right size l. I'm very satosfied
no,no,no,"Bought the phone in late October and not even 6 months and the phone goes dead. Just be careful, we thought it was such a great deal but you get what you paid for or even less in our case."
no,no,no,This phone is not unlocked.
no,no,no,Phone for some reason was acting weird The cámara glitch and the audio was in slow mo voice.. weird phone
yes,yes,yes,Great Quality and just as pictured. I've been using and it works great.
no,yes,yes,"It was used not new, post sad new. What they don't tell you is you will need a sim card to put it on a network. However, a sim card is maybe $20 at the most and it was $500 cheaper than a brand new one."
yes,yes,yes,This phone said it was new when I ordered it. I however is NOT new. It has chips in it on the corners of it. I'm not happy at all with this phone!!
no,yes,no,I requested/ordered black...I was sent Blue.... Phone has had several glitches/software bugs. Purchasing a new phone today because this phone has caused be so many problems in the short time that I have had it.. This was a bad purchase
no,yes,no,when I bought that cell I thought it is a new condition but not ...the pencil it isnt working. I want my money back sinceraly. I paid too much money for used cell phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Love, love, love this phone...it was just like opening a new phone...excellent condition"
no,no,no,Pen is hard work on screen ..
yes,yes,yes,Muy buen artículo
no,no,no,I spent almost 400 dollars. Got the phone tried to activate. Had to call Verizon. Verizon told me that the phone can't be activated because whoever sold me the phone never paid the bill so the phone can never be activated. They sold me a phone that will never work.
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with my purchase. Phone was in amazing condition! Works perfectly so far
no,no,yes,Battery initially charged but since will not hold a charge since. A replacement battery would be acceptable. Please reach out directly
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect! I replaced a Samsung S4, and I chose the Note5 because it is a little bigger, and I like the built-in stylus. I really enjoy using it. I like having the 64GB."
yes,yes,yes,"Came on time and was in good shape, works well. I'm happy."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone came as expected lightly used and in compete working condition, great buy for the price!"
yes,yes,yes,This would be a first smartphone with a stylus for my mom. She likes my Note 4 and all that I do with it. The UI was simple and the tutorials and customization features were a big selling point since she just started her business.
yes,yes,yes,"Love my phone, still learning how to use some features Has started showing signs of glitching, really do not want to return it. Wondering about the emoji upgrade though"
no,no,yes,The camera Is blur
yes,yes,yes,great phone battery ok at best
no,no,no,It keeps freezing &it doesnt stay charged
yes,yes,yes,Everything went like they said it would. Great quality
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I love the note series samsung phones!
yes,yes,yes,Can i used this phone with cricket?
yes,yes,yes,"Was leery about buying a reconditioned phone, bought the phone over a month ago, no problems, no issues, works great this was replacing a Note 5 that I had dropped. The phone was a better price than originally paid for the Note 5."
yes,yes,yes,"When I purchased this phone it said it was ""Like new"" cosmetically but now it's showing I received ""Grade B"" which is a little disappointing. It's been working as promised though so it was well worth the price and I am definitely satisfied so far."
yes,yes,yes,I luv this phone.
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. The looks brand new. It was bought for my husband and he loves it.
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely the best phone I've ever owned couldn't be happier!
yes,yes,yes,Great product thanks
no,no,yes,Deep scratches on screen
yes,yes,yes,I love it but problem charge fasting to running out.. I replaced black Note 5 already. I love it ahh
no,no,no,Phone started freezing initially and now it doesn't even turn on after barely 5 months. Bought the phone on October 2016 .
yes,yes,yes,Very satisfied with this purchase. Bought it for my husband and it was a great upgrade from his note 3 that he had. He gives it a big thumbs up. Battery life much longer and it has a better operating system and quick response time.
yes,yes,yes,It had few scratchs but other wise work perfectly
yes,yes,yes,Second one I've owned after dropping the first one and cracking the screen...even in a heavy duty Otter Box. Good phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I have mixed emotions about this device, while it is easy on the eyes, it's just not practical for daily use unless you spend $30-50 on a high end case, with good screen protector...this device is advertised as being water resistant for 2 meters for 30 minutes , which is complete and utter BS!"
yes,yes,yes,Exactly as described
yes,yes,yes,Better than expected. Really good phone. The cameras ate really good and it runs well haven't had any issues with it so far. Only complaint is that it charges slow but that could just be my charger.
yes,yes,yes,"This is one of the best phones that I have had. The battery life is the main attraction for me. On a full charge, it will go all day. The screen is also very clear."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I have opened every Note and this is the best one ever
yes,yes,yes,"One of the best phones ever made. From the screen to the battery life, so much of this phone is exceptional. However, its software leaves something to be desired unless if you've always had a Samsung phone. Android purists need not apply."
yes,yes,yes,my earlier feedback was not correct because I did not understand the difference between GB storage and GB RAM. This is a wonderful phone and good price. I would buy again.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this for my Daughters 14th Bday - she loves it! It has no noticeable defects, scratches etc. It looks like it's brand new, not used or pre-opened. Was nervous it wouldn't be as good as advertised - but it really was! Thank you for providing an affordable alternative - great product/service!"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone this is by far the best phone I have ever had and I have had small few in the past, galaxy nexus, LG g3, S4 and Driod and this beats all of them, I was going to upgrade to the note 7 unfortunately since the battery issue I will just be sticking with my Note 5 but I have not lost interest..."
yes,yes,yes,"Almost perfect experience. The S Pen broke in half when I went to pull it out of Note 5 phone within 48 hours of delivery, so I was forced to buy a new one from Samsung. Other than that it was great!"
no,yes,yes,Phone is lots of trouble and freezing
yes,yes,yes,Unhappy with no SD card and can't swap battery. But other than that it works great.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone said it was in ""good condition"" but I thought it was brand new when I opened it. I don't write reviews unless I was very impressed! Excellent product"
yes,yes,yes,I have the Note5 for almost 6 months now and I think it's okay. The battery life kind of stink. It seems like i'm always having to charge this thing. I wish it came with the option to add additional storage like the note3 (which I LOVED).
yes,yes,yes,Was better than described
yes,no,yes,"Got it quick, in good condition, and was way better than buying it full price. It was missing the OEM charger, or any charger, but seriously, if you can't find at least a regular Micro USB charger kit, you sell the rock you live under and try these awesome new ""Buildings"" these homo sapiens are on..."
no,yes,yes,"I am very unsatisfied with the product i go, i was led to believe that the phone would be free of scuffs and scraches which is what i paid for. Upon the phones arival i immediately noticed scratches all over the screen and back of the note 5. False advertising at its finest."
yes,yes,yes,"Great functionality, but I HATE not having expandable memory and a fixed battery."
yes,yes,yes,Works perfectly and just as advertised.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is working well.
no,no,no,The gingger prins not work
no,yes,no,Was not 64GB as advertised. Did not send it back because the phone it was replacing was already gone when I found out.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. Easy to use and light. A bit on the large size.
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone. Arrived in great shape. Very pleased.
yes,yes,yes,I love it! Phone is in better condition than describe!
no,no,yes,My phone did not come with charger or any other accessory why????
yes,yes,yes,"Although I didn't personally order from this page, I do currently own a Note 5. I really do enjoying having this phone. I used to be a galaxy s5 user, and before that all the other generation of S. I was unsure how I would feel about the note. Well i love it."
yes,yes,yes,"Unfortunately this review comes a little late in the game, and likely wouldn't have even happened had I not smashed my Galaxy S5. - Quick Background - I am in the tech industry by trade, and have been an android user since the Motorola Droid first arrived."
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful phone! works great connected to sprint no issues or hassle. Love cellular edge great company to buy a cell from
yes,no,yes,"Love the phone, but isn't working properly. Updates fail, and it won't sync with my Gear Fit 2. Will be returnung."
yes,yes,yes,"Fair price on a great phone, no problems, glad I did not opt for the note 7"
yes,yes,yes,"Design Say goodbye to the plastic designs of the past Samsung phones. The new ones now contain glass (it is Corning Gorilla Glass 4, which is very high quality and durable) and a new sleek design."
no,no,no,Battery life is bad and it just doesn't function like it should
no,no,yes,My phone came with no charger Why?
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone. I like a lot of the improvements from the note 3 I had. This phone is more user friendly. Some of the down sides are: You cant remove the rear cover which means you cant add a memory card or change the battery.
no,no,yes,"Great phone, bad battery, please send me a new battery..I'll give you all 5 stars.."
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone, slim and perfect to slip into my back pocket or small purse. Works great!"
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone it's a lot like the galaxy s5 that I replaced but a few more futures and settings and easy to work with. But it does not have the SD card slot and a non-refundable battery back. It takes great pictures and vedio and I belive it's a bit louder in volume then my galaxy s5.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome! My phone arrived sooner than I expected!
no,no,yes,"There is no SIM Card with the phone, how are you supposed to activate the phone?"
yes,yes,yes,"Bluetooth doesn't work, but otherwise it's great."
yes,no,yes,Got this for my son and he likes it so far. It comes with just a regular charger so you will absolutely need to purchase the fast charger.
yes,no,yes,"The Galaxy Note7's are exploding. Get the Note 5, which right now is kind of the newest Note. I LOVE IT! Highly recommended and as described."
no,yes,no,"Extremely disappointing! Phone worked great for 1 year and 2 months, and I would have given it a 5 star rating... but for no reason that I can figure out, the system just died. I can bring up the boot options and Odin screens, but start-up and Odin download only run for about 5 seconds before it..."
yes,yes,yes,Works great looks great
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. Very fast and great screen size. Super responsive. Makes my old S4 seem like a Model A
yes,no,yes,Samsung Note 5 is as good as Note 7 without Iris scan and the edge apps but just about everything is as near perfect as the Note 7 without having to worrying about the batter issue. I had the extra Note 7 S-Pan and I changed the tip and it feels better then the original tip from Note 5.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. I had the NOTE 2 and 4. The NOTE 7 got recalled so I got the Note 5. Can't find one thing I don't like. Finger Print security is good. I use Samsung Pay all the time. Wireless charging is great.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, great connectivity and sound quality. I've been told on the other side of phone conversations about the clarity of sound when I use this phone. I utilize 2 phones this Note 5 and a Samsung Galaxy S6, one for business and the other for personal use."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. I prefer 6"" screens, but this works for now on Verizon."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone will prpbably not explode in your pocket and I really like mine a lot. Fast, light and stylish. Lack of an additional SD card storage slot is a negative. Only really minor issue is with the fingerprint unlock function which is more of a software problem."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent product, ""like new"". Really meant like new, no flaws or signs of use.Activated with no problems after getting sim card at Sprint dealer for no charge. Will buy from red cell again!"
yes,no,yes,Great fast .But the finger print reader did not work.
yes,yes,yes,Works perfectly fine for now still looks brand new I've had it for a couple of months now
no,yes,yes,It has a hairlinecrack along the back but I guess that's what I get when buying used..... BUT it should have been disclosed in the description.
no,no,yes,AMAZING phone just the battery life sucks and in 3 hours I had to charge after using it.
yes,yes,yes,Couldn't be happier. Will do business again
no,yes,no,Arrived very promptly but had to return due to its inability to pick up cell signal in this area
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Great condition. Highly recommended.
yes,yes,yes,This item excellent not like new.thanks
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased this phone to replace my Samsung Note 7, that was recalled. Prior to the Note 7, I had the note 4. I have to say that this is a great phone even coming down from the Note 7."
yes,yes,yes,"First, let me say that I have owned every single Samsung Note since the first one all the way to the Note 5 now and after 7 months of daily use on may Note 5 it is by far and above my favorite cell phone I have ever owned! Here are some of the things I like and don't like about it: Pros: 1."
yes,yes,yes,I won't buy this phone until I get the sd card back and the removable battery. (remember the wall hugger Comercial. I do and that says it all for me.) Also the inferred so you can use your phone as a remote for your tv. Now do I miss using my phone to pay for things. Yepp!
yes,yes,yes,"I honestly was doubting that for the $600 price I was charged that I would be getting a good phone. I was pleasantly surprised. The phone came in great condition as promised, with only a minor scuff on the back."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent. Worked perfectly with straighttalk even if locked with ATT.
yes,yes,yes,Arrived in secured packaging. Added it to the Straight Talk network in 30 minutes phone works fine
yes,yes,yes,"The good: the phone arrived in 2 days as promised. It looks great, etc. The bad: this phone does not come with a SIM card. No SIM card, no activating. Apparently, unlocked phones, in general don't come with SIM cards."
yes,yes,yes,One of my all time favorite phones.
yes,yes,yes,"Very good phone..love android for its ease of use. Have had no problems with this phone and have bought two of them. Takes great pics, fast processing than my Samsung Note 3....only downside..would like to be able to have access to change battery if need be....back is sealed shut...."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product. Probably the best note yet. Works perfectly and very satisfied with the item.
yes,yes,yes,could not say enough about the solid and almost perfect ability of this phone both physically and technically sound telecommunications equipment. my only downfall is that there was not any extension slot for this phone as far as memory and if you work this phone as hard as I do with aps and...
no,yes,yes,"I have the verizon model. I've had this phone for about 3 months now and at first I loved it! I loved the big screen. I loved the S-pen. The quality of the picture was really good as well. BUT, what good are any of those things when the phone freezes and crashes constantly."
yes,yes,yes,it is new and amazing
yes,yes,yes,"Love it. So much faster than note 4, and I don't mind that it doesn't have a removable battery or an SD card. Just make sure you get the 64gb if you need more storage. If you have more than that you should get a storage account."
yes,no,yes,Phone was in good shape but the description said it came with original fast charger and it did not. Not a deal breaker but for what I paid for the phone they should have included the fast charging plug. Also didn't come with sim card tray key but again no big deal. For me it's the principal..
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. No complaints. Great time on arrival. Packaging was great.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome. I have had it for about a month now. I have no complaints. It is fast, powerful and gets any job done. The White color is crisp like a pearl. I love the features of the S-Pen, quickly taking notes even when the screen is off."
yes,yes,yes,"You guys need to change the color option to black sapphire because it's not black, but actually a dark blue phone"
yes,yes,yes,"Love the Note 5. Previously had the Note 4, wouldn't work when we switched carriers. This phone transferred perfectly."
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone for about 4 months on Verizon. It was already the perfect phone for me. I updated 2 days ago to Android Marshmallow and the experience is even better.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone!!! Came faster than expected. Extremely satisfied!!!
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great. Nice size, very fast. Gives you 100gb of cloud space with One drive. Great for memo taking, office work and signing documents is an added bonus! The downsize of course is no removable battery and no expanded memory. But otherwise a terrific phone"
yes,yes,yes,We bought those as Christmas to ourselves after having our S4's for over 2 years. At the moment of this review we've had them for about 5 months and they are just ridiculously awesome.
yes,yes,yes,"Wow, this phone was a huge disappointment. There are so many flaws with this phone, so I will break my review down into several areas. Large Screen I initially bought this because I wanted to have a phone with a large screen. In that area, the phone does not disappoint."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is the fifth iteration of the Note Series by Samsung. To the dismay of many consumers loyal to the note series, the Galaxy Note 5 has been released not including some of the capabilities in which its predecessors where highly favored because of."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone in excellent condition, thank you."
yes,yes,yes,I have had this phone since October 2015. In fact im writing this review using it. It is a superb smart phone. Fully capable. Highly recommended! I use 45 gb of data 5000 texts and 1500 emails a month. No problems.
yes,yes,yes,"My Note 5 arrived as advertised. White, 64gb, AT&T model. It was advertised in ""good"" conditions. But had alot of small scratches on the screen."
yes,no,yes,No removable battery. That is all.
yes,yes,yes,Fully Cool mobile
yes,yes,yes,excess samsung galaxy note 7 The wide screen 5.7 inch Super AMOLED technology which is very comfortable to use despite using one tanggan It has been equipped corning gorilla glass screen protector 5 It has been equipped Fingerprint sensor Already supports 4G LTE network for super-fast internet...
yes,yes,yes,I had to give back my Note 7 twice. I was very very satisfied with that phone now I had to take the Galaxy S7 Edge which is a very crappy phone to me. I use my phone Bluetooth in my car. The speaker coming out of the phone only plays one side in the car.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought my Note Edge a couple years ago, and the reason I'm doing this 2017 review is because although I could buy an S8 or other flagship phone, I won't because I'm a very happy camper with my Note Edge."
no,yes,yes,this phone sucks the only thing that was OK was the camera that was the only thing that was good on the whole phone.the ui was buggy and laggy the fingerprint scanner made the phone even slower. the build quality was OK the edge was OK i liked it it was novelty.
yes,yes,yes,"I loved my earlier edge and when it came up for replacement the Note Edge looks and works better. The touchscreen seems clearer and more durable. (I have dropped it more than a few times and it has survived what other phones haven't) The camera seems much sharper, but is difficult to activate for a..."
yes,yes,yes,So. Hardware wise it is ok except for the battery could be bigger and the line out volume is typically Samsung means not loud enough. So watching a quiet movie with headphone in an airplane is a challenge.
yes,yes,yes,"Beautiful Phone, with SnapDragon Processor, with Note 5 out in the Market, I would still suggest my friends to buy this device, my Favourites are S-Pen, IR Blaster, SD Card Support, Edge Screen, and the Biometric Security."
yes,yes,yes,"Galaxy Note Edge does not get the praise it deserves. I also questioned the practicality of using this phone, but once I held it in my hands, I fell in love with this piece of art."
yes,yes,yes,"I have bought new phone Samsung Galaxy Note Edge. I have opened the box and I was using the phone for two days than I found some clerical error that should not be there. The first lens of camera was detached, further more I saw some damages in back sensors (for mesuring heartbeat, self-picturing,..."
yes,yes,yes,the best mobile ever since last 3 month i have this mobile i think i ll continue with my note edge at least next 1 years..before i hv note 4 note 3 s5 s4 all mobile jst ok but the note edge mind blowing i really love that gadget..
yes,yes,yes,"note edge is the best phone which i used ever i had use moe then 100 phone but I didn't use like note edge Beautiful phone, smooth user interface, build quality very high. Edge screen does enhance user functionality from a different dimension altogether and is accurate and responsive to touch Ultra..."
yes,yes,yes,"S-pen very sensitive and responsive , e a pretty good job with the phones ability to distinguish an actual tap over a graze from your palm. The touchwiz interface isn't that bad in my opinion but it does show a slight lag here and there depending on what you are doing."
yes,yes,yes,"Probably this was the mobile which tend me to change from Iphone, and my first Android phone, things quite confusing intially but now after having using it for more than 5 months I love it."
yes,yes,yes,"Guys,nI never bought this phone in the first place but I can assure you that its over priced. My friend bought galaxy s3 2 to 3 years back for 32000 rupees.. now its around 13k.. so what's the actual worth of these phones?"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has amazing features that will mesmerize you for sure like Curved screen for more interactive display,Side panel offers shortcut to media streaming, editing, and browsing tools,Improved stylus,Software development kit allows developer to make niffy innovations."
yes,yes,no,"Samsung had a bad 2014, as they could not catch up with Apple in premium segment nor they could reign on small players like Micromax in lower end. So they are confused about the pricing of phones. Want to push their profits up by setting premium price tag for their low quality/terrible spec phones."
yes,yes,yes,"Beautiful phone, smooth user interface, build quality very high. Edge screen does enhance user functionality from a different dimension altogether and is accurate and responsive to touch Ultra power saving mode very handy if low batt and can stretch standby time out to 5-7 days."
yes,yes,yes,"I picked up Note Edge two months ago in Seoul, Korea, where I am doing an exchange semester. Though the price was a bit less at around 60,000 but with insurance, original cover, no extra accessories and no difference in street price and MRP, it costs roughly the same.Unlike apple where the pricing..."
yes,no,yes,Don't rate low simply coz u fell price is high..nnPeople don't complain and bother abt price tags when it's has fruit logo...nnSpecs wise IPhone 6 = RedMi 1snFor price 1 Phone6 = 9 RedMi 1snnIf don't like the product or Samsung don't simply underrate....
yes,yes,yes,"I do not do reviews to often but I felt like I should for this one since some people are so iffy about the design of the phone. First let me say that before getting this phone I was deciding between this, the nexus 6, and iphone 6 plus."
yes,yes,yes,"Beautiful phone, smooth user interface, build quality very high (despite previous reported concerns about this). Edge screen does enhance user functionality from a different dimension altogether and is accurate and responsive to touch (accidental taps are actually rare during everyday handling)."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy Round, the brand's first curved display in a phone, was a step towards curved display but didn't really do much beyond. The Note Edge combines an innovative design with actual real-life usage, which means it could be more of a hit than Samsung's other novelties."
no,yes,yes,Two main problems so far...battery gets exhausted very quickly and sometimes it becomes hot
yes,yes,yes,A wonderful phone.
yes,yes,yes,Marvellous mobile.
yes,yes,yes,The phone looks good and performance is smooth. samsung says this smartphone is elligible for 50 GB space in dropbox. but still there is no increase of space in my dropbox account. whether this offer is still there or expired?
no,yes,no,Disappointed mobile was dead on second day.....hope the replacement works well. Don't know really product was original or not.
yes,no,yes,"If You have 50k budget, nothing feels premium than this. EDGE SCREEN changes phone category along with S-PEN. So you don't need to compare it with oneplus 2 and say Its halfer price. Pros: 1.Edge screen,INNOVATIVE DESIGN 2. S-pen(action memo,screen write on a move) 3."
yes,yes,yes,Purchased in 35999 bucks only in Deewali Mega Offer.. Everything is Fine except Battery.
yes,yes,yes,Its features are awesome it gives a royal look I lobed it
yes,yes,yes,"Packing & mobile looking like refurbish, if any next promotion is there we need to think about not to purchase the item."
yes,yes,yes,Amazing features. It's new n u gonna enjoy
yes,yes,yes,The phone is awesome..amazinf design..solid built quality...expandable memory and removable battery...never heats up even when playing heavy games..no lag whatsoever...i bought this in sale some 2 months back and 100% satisfied!!
no,no,no,got damaged item... i'm very disappointed
yes,no,yes,"The best hands handset wich includes some exceptional features like edge, stylus, quick charge etc.."
yes,yes,yes,Amazing product. I just liked the edge feature which is unique from other Samsung phones.
yes,yes,yes,Edge feature takes some getting used to
yes,yes,yes,I really liked this phone.very good features nd got everything i needed.
no,no,no,"Mine started over heating, and rebooting on its own. Battery lasts just 6-7 hours of moderate usage of calling, browsing and Emails. Forget gaming. Edge panels (some free - the CNN ap and some paid panels like call log) stopped working after android 6.0.1 update."
no,no,no,Defective product
no,no,no,Got defective mobile in sealed pack box.
no,no,no,Touch is not working properly and return page is also closed worst site and seller
yes,yes,yes,It's an awesome phn for the price of 35k. Although i think ram could have been 4 gb looking at the operating software.if I don't open any application in background still it consumes around 2gb of ram out of 2.75 available ram.that's the only issue so far I have observed. Camera quality is vy good.
yes,yes,yes,Good Phone. I got for 35000. Worthy of it. Watch the price variations and buy. You may get a good deal as I got.
yes,yes,yes,Its an amazing Phone. I am a fan of Samsung Note Series and am confident about its performance. Samsung Galaxy Note edge is a perfect combination of Performance and Style. Whenever I am in a meeting and keep the phone on the desk everyone asks hey which is this Phone and after seeing its features...
yes,yes,yes,"I have never been so happy and satisfied with any mobiles that I help earlier. It is certainly a head turner. Everything about the mobile is perfect, the looks, the feel, performance, battery back up. I have been using Samsung note 3 for past 3 years now and wanted to continue having note."
yes,yes,yes,No doubt it's true edge generation smartphone
no,yes,yes,Battery failed... not worth.. phone slips form hand easily..
no,no,no,Hello Wwhenever i make calls screen appears as blank and when i do watz up calling then unable to end the call or on speaker. Pls let me know what would be a solution? Does it require replacement ?
yes,yes,yes,Does what it is meant to do.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product by Samsung...... the curved edge is so glitzy...... very hep..... luved it
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product at great price highly recommend it.
yes,yes,yes,"1.A beast of a phone. 2.One of the best Notes out there. 3.Unlike many other phones , feels very comfotable in hand. Others may instill pain in your hands.This won. 4.Edge screen is a delight to use. Full marks. 5.Battery is OKAY. Not brilliant. 6.Built in apps are great."
no,no,no,"Don't buy this product unless you like to charge 3 times in a day. The battery is the worst I have ever seen,it says 10 hr working for battery but with 100% charge if you browse or do few WhatsApp you will see the charge is 50% now."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is not good
yes,yes,yes,"Since 2013, the Korean conglomerate unveiled curved wearables , TVs and even a smartphone, the Galaxy Round . (Rival LG has two too .) Here, the Galaxy Note Edge -- first released in November 2014 -- furthers the curved campaign with a subtly arched ""second screen"" that's devoted to productivity."
no,yes,yes,"I guess the product would be great with reviews all around, about it. My experience is with the state of the box in which it came, was tampered. The product was returned by me without opening it and now I wait for a replacement."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone in the market and probably by Samsung, S6 / S7 edge, all are just edge screens, this one has a seperate edge and can be configured separately. Awesome"
yes,yes,yes,"I have a family of five and well all have cell phones some iphones, some samgsung and even a windows phone. About 1 1/2 years ago went for the Galaxy Note Edge 5 after my gifted iPhone 5 went south."
yes,yes,yes,I really do love this phone. It is extremely responsive and unlike an Apple iPhone I can and do use wireless charging on it and that a really great benefit.
yes,yes,yes,"The EDGE display –– especially inside the Galaxy S6’s metal chassis –– costs Samsung A LOT to make, even more than Apple’s top of the range iPhone 6 Plus. According to IHS Display, the Galaxy S6 EDGE costs Samsung $290 to build."
no,no,no,"I've had this phone for several months and was pretty satisfied overall. That is, until I dropped it. I was sitting at a ball game when the phone fell from my knees to the ground. It fell face up and the phone was in a protective billfold case. That said I was shocked the screen cracked."
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love this phone I have had it for 3 months. I have yet to find anything that doesn't work perfectly on this phone. Videos sharp crisp and clear stutter free. This is the best phone ever made. The larger screen is perfect, the stylus is a bonus too. I could not be happier."
yes,yes,yes,I had a galaxy S5 before and then picked this up. Wow!
no,no,no,"IF you're willing to pay for it, the return on your investment will be there, 2nd to none."
yes,yes,yes,One of the most reliable phone I have used so far. Stylish and practical. Have been using it for more than 2 years now and it had never let me down even once. I'll miss this device as I am planning to hand it over to my aunt for now.
no,yes,yes,This phone heats up a lot
yes,yes,yes,Good phone though Samsung has stopped production.
yes,yes,no,"I'm currently using note edge from last 15 days . The phone is good. But there is a negative point is - it has heating problem and it's battery quality is very poor. Otherwise other functions of phone like camera ,video, air window all are good."
yes,yes,yes,A great phone. The edge is of great functionality and i just enjoy using the phone. The processor is quick and the ram complement it well. I have nearly 200 apps installed in the phone and still it functions smoothly. Highly recommend this phone for others.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone forever
yes,yes,yes,Is it supports Ip water resistant
no,no,yes,Front camera is awful
yes,yes,yes,Awesome device edge display is very nice
yes,yes,yes,"no cons .... about this phone .... value for money .... plz dont ask any questions go for it ,,,if u can afford it"
yes,yes,yes,Super Phone But Why Samsung Not Showing Mersy On Price.
yes,yes,yes,The Note Edge is a different phone altogether. It has extremely thin design - thinner than I expected and features this unique extra glass on the side that you can use it for displaying useful information. I hope more and more developers use this for showing extra information.
yes,yes,yes,I just played with one that my friend bought. I have a Note 3 and the Edge feels much thinner than mine. It feels unique and amazing in hands. The screen does feels smaller than mine as length of it is smaller.
yes,yes,yes,"Camera: Camera ISO is just 800 which is present in Galaxy S2 as well . Shutter speed is also comparatively low as this price. Low light shoot is pathetic w.r.t. Sony xperia z2, z3 and iPhone. Yet to explore htc one m8."
yes,yes,yes,"It's the best phone I ever had,even if it has a high price tag,it's worth it!"
yes,yes,yes,I ve used many samsung phone. They are amazing but gets wrecked soon if we are not careful and cost a dime to repair but edge is different!! I used it. It's screen is totally different and amazing. You wil love this phone if have good money. Even I liked it more then my iPhone 6.
no,no,no,Waste of money.technology worst.
yes,yes,yes,Bought this phone one day ago. Just played with it for some time and I am totally in love with it. The best phablet available as of now for sure. I am writing this review after using almost every available previous phablet. The edge screen is just amazing. Samsung is back with a bang.
yes,yes,yes,Good phone i am loving it.
yes,yes,yes,"This is an excellent phone-♥♥♥-productivity tool. The display is brilliant, as with most Samsung high-end devices these days. However being equipped with Gorilla Glass 3 specifications, the screen is somewhat more prone to scratches than newer Samsung phones (that come with Gorilla Glass 4),..."
yes,yes,yes,This my execllect phone is have abd i an using is very and execellet features
yes,no,yes,"Quite disapointed, too big, too heavy... Battery life time is barely one day (8h)."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung... The innovator??... Well my new Note Edge is forcing me to believe so!!
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone and have paired with gear s and gear circle. Innovation at its best.
yes,yes,yes,The screen is probably the best ever put on a
yes,yes,yes,Best phone in the world till date .Edge screen made u feel different from others. Where r u i phone lovers no comparision just The Best from any others.Review is for those who got money to buy this phone not for time passers.
yes,yes,yes,"There are alot of reviews talking abt specs of this device, hence, I will not repeat that. Its my 3rd note device (Note 1, 2 and 4 Edge) I was planning to not to continue with the streak but then I saw this device and it changed my mind. I bought this device for Rs 48,000 this month."
yes,yes,yes,Super cool phone...
yes,yes,yes,I brought when it was @ 57000/- . I was bit upset in spending this much amount. But galaxy note edge changed my mood . It's awesome. Bit proud also. Features outstanding. No complaint. Just loving it...
no,yes,no,The waste phone in my life because not at all good not continusly 30 min using the phone go to switch off.....battery back up is very poor
yes,yes,yes,"Hmmm...for some one who also has the Note 2, I find that the '2' is better in some respects. Excellent cameras though. And awesome looks of course!"
yes,yes,yes,Got note edge today it is excellent. It's like dream come true.
yes,no,yes,Just got my phone. Seller was 1 day late delivering it but thats ok. Phone is super awsome. The edge screen is the main attraction. No lags as well.
yes,no,yes,"Samsung does not give any accessories for this product for free. No scratch guard, No OTG cable, no wireless charger in the box. I tried to connect with 4g on airtel, but the 4g feature is auto enabled."
no,yes,no,Not worth... Price is too high... Except display... Everything sucks... Build quality is so cheap... Don't buy this... Never recommend...
yes,yes,yes,"Many phone users find fault with anything new and unique. They make remarks like 'why do you have to have it do this or that""? Well boys and girls, why do you even need all those goodies on any smartphone. Truth is, the edge just does things better."
yes,yes,yes,Im glad I waited for this phone its so user friendly and easy to use....
yes,yes,yes,"Couldn't be happier with my decision. Upgraded from Note II. Almost bit on the Note 4 after reading the ""experts"" and their prescient thoughts about the Note edge. So glad I didn't succumb to their cynicism. I looks great and feels great in the hand. So to those who wonder, think of it this way..."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone condition is as described, but is was bloated with ads and we had to replace the Android launcher. Ads were showing from everywhere in the phone."

yes,no,yes,I had pervious owned a note 4 but then upgraded to the Samsung s6 edge it was a nice phone .but no s pen no way to upgrade the memory so I sold it and bought a note edge and got best of both phones.upgraded to marshmallow so the s pen is lots better as you can now add shortcuts on the edge screen...

yes,yes,yes,I recommend. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,Works well as expect
no,no,no,His product came damaged and when contacted he denied any wrongdoing. I photographed the damage and it was old damage that had been there awhile. The phone is un-use able due to back key not working. Glass was old age broken. DO NOT BUY OFF THIS -JUST JONES conman.

yes,yes,yes,Brilliant I love my new galaxy note edge
yes,yes,yes,The phone is in a good condition for the moment.
yes,yes,yes,"I simply love that phone, that curve is amazing, s6 or s7 edge can't compare. It's Samsungs prototype into curved edge displays, very first one and one of a kind. Also got note 5 and... Well edge simply sticks out of the crowd"
yes,yes,yes,"its a very good upgrade compared to my old phone but it is very similar to any other Samsung phone, the amazing thing about this phone is the battery last almost the whole day without needing to charge and the high-speed charger is a godsend"
yes,yes,yes,"It's fantastic, one of the best phones ever created. Very good and quick communication with seller, Amazingly fast dispatched, ordered on Sunday afternoon, a day and a half later got it in my hands. Highly recommend"

yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone... love it... Still working my way through learning some of the features..
no,yes,no,Package came in an envelope. Not a box which had me worried since it was an electronic device. Opened up the unit to check it. Battery is not charging..Unit would vibrate then show the Lightning icon then do it all over again when it is plugged. Hoping to get this returned and replaced.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone for the money!
no,no,no,"It stopped working in less than a year, I do not recommend buying it."
no,yes,no,"Only because i needed to click on the first star to write my review...... DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!! Within 8 months to date (March 12th, 2017) my phone was useless. It started restarting for itself randomly.... at first i thought it was a software issue..."
yes,yes,yes,Some issues downloading multi media and group texts. But overall it is a great value for what we paid.

yes,yes,yes,wonderful phone
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I love the newest edition of edge. Works with T-Mobile and is unlocked. Phone has a really large screen which is just what I was looking for. I couldn't be any happier with the note edge.
no,yes,no,It worked fine for a while. I bought this 11 months ago and it worked fine until last week when it started freezing randomly and rebooting. Factory resets don't help and it may be a mainboard issue. As it is an international model I can't have it fixed in the US due to parts differences.
yes,yes,yes,Stilll using it. Amazing phone i always receive questions about what type of phone im using.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone works perfect here in Trinidad WI
no,yes,no,"Terrible, seriously. The battery life is horrible. I tried literally everything I could to resolve the battery drain on this phone. New kernels, different roms, different batteries, a second battery. Nothing fixed the battery drain."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product! This should be marketed as a 'micropad' or something like that as it is so much more than your average smartphone and a lot more handy and efficient than any mini pad. Great for traveling!...
yes,yes,yes,It's very excellent the best cellphone
no,no,no,"I love Samsung phones. I’ve owned the Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, S4, and S5 (personal and work phones). If not for the great Droid Turbo, I’d be rocking the Note 4 right now. The Note Edge is the first Sammy Phone I’ve handled in a long time that I do not recommend."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone!!! You can take a picture - draw or write a note on it & send it off as e-mail - Just what I needed. SO MANY other features & functions.BATTERY LIFE: I'm getting one to two days on a 100% charge.For instance: I just made a 2.5 hour call from a 100% battery & charge went down to about...
yes,yes,yes,"Wow. I love it. Haven't felt that way about a phone in a long time. Love the edge feature despite some reviews that were non-plused about it. Nice hand feel. Not as big as you might think but big enough for content consumption. Wish the back wasn't a ""pleather"" pattern, feel."
no,yes,no,"Terrible, seriously. The battery life is horrible. I tried literally everything I could to resolve the battery drain on this phone. New kernels, different roms, different batteries, a second battery. Nothing fixed the battery drain."
no,no,no,"I love Samsung phones. I’ve owned the Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, S4, and S5 (personal and work phones). If not for the great Droid Turbo, I’d be rocking the Note 4 right now. The Note Edge is the first Sammy Phone I’ve handled in a long time that I do not recommend."
no,yes,no,I really like the appearance and feel of the phone. Resolution is great. Giving it only 3 stars because of miserable battery life. I use the phone a lot but must recharge about three times a day. Always carry a charger around. This is the worst battery performance on any phone I've ever owned.

yes,yes,yes,Excellent..love the phone..great buy

no,no,yes,pauleg is not fit.... oh my god .. what is this .. event hog is a wrong ... give to me my money back . h
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone with the ability to take notes and is very powerful to do everything I need. I have never used one of the note phones but this one is very easy to learn and makes a beginner like me be able to use it without a large learning curve.Had the phone for 6 months and it has stopped charging...
yes,yes,yes,Met my expectations
yes,yes,yes,"Okay,I have had this phone for over 2months now and I LOVE it is good value for money,its my first time using or even buying a Samsung product and its been an amazing experience, I sincerely recommend it for any one,I was abit overwhelmed when I got it,it was bigger than my Xperia,but I am so use to..."
no,no,no,"I love Samsung phones. I’ve owned the Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, S4, and S5 (personal and work phones). If not for the great Droid Turbo, I’d be rocking the Note 4 right now. The Note Edge is the first Sammy Phone I’ve handled in a long time that I do not recommend."
yes,yes,yes,A great cellphone and very sharp.
yes,no,yes,Very happy but the battery is finished fast.
yes,yes,yes,Device is in perfect working order and even arrived before the original ship date. Everything was in the box and their is nothing like pulling out your brand new phone out of the box and plastic. It is worth every penny
no,no,no,"It's been more than a year I've got this phone, and it took me a while to find out that the S-pen didn't work at all. I thought it was something I could easily fix and I didn't filed a complaint because of that. I have tried several places and noone seems to know why doesn't work."
no,yes,no,"Over all samsung sucks ,no precision, I have notifiction when I click and unlock it goes to main screen which I call a dump phone not a smart one , it has a huge processor which cause the phone warm up like 375c oven ,trust me you can cook steak on it and leak battery , now it starts to freeze..."
no,no,no,Problem with internet connection. Doesnt detect network time to time
yes,no,yes,i think its a good phone but come on 500 dollars for a phone thats over doing it i mea at least have it at 75 or100 dollars who agrees
no,no,no,The battery is very bad!
yes,yes,yes,It's so unique and great.
yes,no,yes,I love my upgrade from the note 3. Tried the 5 but didn't like it. Returned it the next day.

yes,yes,yes,I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE PHONE EXCEPT THE COVER FOR THE BACK. FEELS LIKE ITS GONNA BRAKE WHEN TAKING IT OFF
yes,yes,yes,"Very beautiful, recommend"
yes,yes,yes,I feel good happy with product
yes,no,no,"So is a lot I can say about this phone, but I have work so I'll keep it as simple a possible. Overall I like this phone itself no issues there(that's the 3 stars). The problem I have is I'm pretty sure that whatever was wrong with this phone is still wrong somewhat."
no,no,no,I ordered a NEW phone for my son but it arrived used and damaged it was advertise that is came with everything including headphones but original it came with just the charger and battery.... I'm DISAPPOINTED! !!
no,no,yes,Received as listed
yes,yes,yes,Instantly fell in love with the phone. I purchased it used and it actually looks and works better then my edge 6 when u got it brand new.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone!!
yes,yes,yes,its not good at all don't buy it.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone only issue I have is I ordered a T-Mobile and received ATT phone but other than that perfect
yes,yes,yes,I have played with this phone all day since it arrived and so far I'm quite happy with it and it is definitely the best phone I have ever owned. The only thing I really have to complain about is that it didn't come with all the parts in the box.
yes,yes,yes,"This is technology at its best, arrive fast in good condition. Bluetooth work great. Use it at work, nice a clear. very good price. A show stopper to my friends. No problem, good starter phone with high quality. This one I wanted but my budget, brought me to it. Shipping packaging was excellent."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. So far I've been very happy with it as a replacement for the Galaxy Note 2.
yes,yes,yes,very good buy again
yes,yes,yes,It very good and easy to do thanks for supplying good product for customers.
no,yes,no,Bad key bord need to download something else.
yes,yes,yes,"You will love this phone once you understand all it has to offer. I'm not a phone geek so I kept looking at mine for a while wondering where to start. When you start, you can use it for everything. Samsung, keep going - great product."
no,no,no,"I've had this phone for several months and was pretty satisfied overall. That is, until I dropped it. I was sitting at a ball game when the phone fell from my knees to the ground. It fell face up and the phone was in a protective billfold case. That said I was shocked the screen cracked."
yes,yes,yes,This item works good
yes,yes,yes,"From the exceptional display to the speed and call quality, this phone can't be faulted. The edge screen adds a unique aspect as well. I have had several Notes, including the first release and this is by far the best of all."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, is really a good phone to have. It does everything you need a phone to do and more. As far as issues, I have no issues to state at the moment."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, better then what I expected. Received it earlier then I thought , very helpful staff. Very satisfied!! Thanks !"
yes,yes,yes,What a piece of kit. Had an S3 previously so operating system is easily picked up in a minute. Love the edge function and the remote control for my TV & cable!
yes,yes,yes,A Fantasic upgrade to my Samsung Galaxy Note 2. I hope I get the same life span from the Edge. Loving the interface and features on the side bar.
no,no,no,This phone does not work on 4g
yes,no,yes,"I did like the design although the functions are similar like galaxy 5, from the aesthetic point of view it is fantastic."
yes,yes,yes,"Great idea, with the Edge screen more functional than gimmicky. Far more powerful than my previous Note 2; battery life is, however, much less. The screen is brilliant but likely an important factor compromising battery life. On balance, a significant technological advance."
yes,no,yes,"Tablet-type Smartphone with Revolutionary Design Pros:-Weighing 174 grams, this 151.3 x 82.4 x 8.3 mm Galaxy Note Edge has an upgraded 3000 mAh battery allowing more power and supports upto 18 hours of talk time and 67 hours of music play."
yes,yes,yes,looks like new but can not make update for system also no head phone
yes,yes,yes,"Quality used product. Bought from atomic cellular, and condition ""very good"" is as advertised. Minor blemishes and good working condtion and battery life."
yes,yes,yes,It be messing up. It freeze all the time.
no,no,no,"I purchased a second phone after the first one had a defective Sim card reader, and it has the same issue. I WILL NEVER buy from this store again."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the Note Edge, but the one sent me was the Verizon and I wanted the AT&T version. But at least I don't worry about it exploding or catching fire.."
yes,yes,yes,No problem. So far so good after a full month of me using this phone
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone alot!
no,no,no,Phone didn't work....
yes,yes,yes,Device came as advertised..thank you
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone! It's everything I'm looking for in a device: it's got an edge for multi-tasking, a stylus for highlighting and note taking, and there's a bunch of screen real estate to be able to look at all the content I need to."
yes,yes,yes,"I replaced my note2 with the note7, but lets not play with fire. When I went looking for another replacement I couldn't believe the price ($700). When the note5 came out originally I didn't upgrade for two reasons; non-removable battery & lack of expansion slot."
yes,yes,yes,Had a Samsung Galaxy 's 7 edge broke the screen. Insurance companies didn't have a replacement. As far as I'm concerned the note edge is twice the phone. Very happy with it.
no,no,no,The device was defective
no,no,no,This is by far the worst phone i have ever had. The battery life sucks and not only does it constantly freeze but the phone completely cuts of at 50% and will not cut back on unless plugged into the charger. I hate this phone soo much and i cant wait to get another from another seller.
no,no,no,Came with a dead battery and sim locked to Sprint prepaid. Seller did not respond to my emails for over a week after I got the item. Since I was travelling abroad I had to sell my soul to get it unlocked for use and spent hours searching towns for a battery so I could turn it on.
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone!!! Easy to use!
yes,yes,yes,and very well put together phone nice design and great features best phone I had yet not as big and bulky as you may think
yes,yes,yes,"I can only say that this phone is amazing. I purchased this phone on launch, it is everything you should expect from the Galaxy Note line of phones. Skip the S lines there is not much going on there."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone
no,no,no,"I love Samsung phones. I’ve owned the Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, S4, and S5 (personal and work phones). If not for the great Droid Turbo, I’d be rocking the Note 4 right now. The Note Edge is the first Sammy Phone I’ve handled in a long time that I do not recommend."
yes,yes,yes,"The Note Edge is an awesome phone, great design, great camera, excellent note capabilities, but there have been persistent issues with dropped calls with Sprint, (well documented in various forums online) which Sprint have ignored and not addressed -- so if you are considering buying this phone it's..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone, takes some getting used to. Having a hard time finding a case I like."
yes,yes,yes,Great everthing. I highly recommend
no,no,no,Phone is complete garbage. It kept freezing and the screen going black. Never will buy another note. I would give it zero stars if I could
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, sprint service on the phone ;questionable"
yes,yes,yes,Just as described. Works great.
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone. Screen size, clarity, and the nifty tool bar make it a must have."
yes,yes,yes,"Great spare phone,better than most,great product and service."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent device works great
yes,yes,yes,worked fine just didnt end up keeping it
yes,yes,yes,"Had a bunch of small problems. Random shut off, dropped calls, little stuff but my old phone worked better. Was nice to have while waiting for the newest phone."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone!!! Works perfectly!!
yes,yes,yes,The product is not free to use any camera operator takes too long to focus the images I do not siemto well with the product
yes,yes,yes,"This is a really great phone, probably one of the best that Samsung has made. The ""edge"" thing is pretty useful at times, and battery life, while not spectacular, is more than adequate IF you can find a decent new battery."
no,yes,no,Battery does not stay charged - had to purchase a new one. The screen will start jumping and split screen appears just out of the blue. Can tell it was defective. But will hold onto it until Samsung releases something new. I bought this as a temporary fix to the Samsung Note 7 issue
no,yes,yes,My note 4 screen broke and unlike iPhone they are pain and a half to change and very the price of a new phone also. I purchased this phone and had nothing but problems from the beginning.
no,yes,no,Couldn't get it to work didn't take my SIM card had to return it no good
yes,yes,yes,The phone works just as it should and the phone showed up in great condition. Thank you.
yes,yes,yes,Bought this phone for my Husband for Christmas. He loves this phone alot. It has alot of great features. Was in great shape. No signs of wear and was very easy to transfer over to our plan. I recommend this phone for anyone.
no,yes,no,Not to impressed with the quality of this product. The phone had been dropped at least three times. There were scratches on the screen! The battery is shot. Only holds a charge for a short time. It also shuts it self of randomly. I recommend not buying this product!
no,yes,no,After having this phone for a couple months the texting no longer works on the phone and the phone constantly freezes and locks itself or glitches when I'm in apps. Completely disappointed.
yes,no,yes,No complaints. The phone looked new'ish. Minor blemishes which was expected for a used phone. I really liked the fact that they added the imei numbers on the box which made activation easy. This may be my new used phone provider.
no,no,no,"This is first review on any product I've purchased in the past. DO NOT buy this product. Even if I were to have it for free, I wouldn't take it. I have had several phones but this is beyond horrible. Keeps shutting off, a battery life of very few hours when not in use."
yes,yes,yes,It does and doesn't. The phone will cut off when battery falls below 30 but other than that it works fine.
yes,yes,no,"Wow pleasantly surprised with this purchase. My note 4 stopped working after almost 2 years. I am a phone snob and that phone was the best. Well i was eligible for an upgrade so got the S7 Edge. Took it back after 3 days. Did some research, watched YouTube reviews of countless phones."
no,yes,no,This product arrived as expected but after the battery drops below 40% it shuts off and keeps restarting untill i plug it in and charge it to above 40%.
yes,yes,yes,It meet my expectations
yes,yes,yes,great phone except for the battery
yes,yes,yes,no esta liberado para europa
no,yes,yes,The phone appearance was good but I wasn't told that the battery was messed up. I takes forever to charge and then it will die so quick.
no,yes,no,This phone was awesome for about a month. Then out of the blue it began its issues with randomly shutting off. Looks like i got a faulty phone i can't return. :(
no,yes,no,Iits ok but keeps cutting off
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has so many cool features, I don't know where to start. I was a little concerned the edge was something I would like, but now I love it. Easy to use and customize to my needs. I was a long time Iphone user and hesitant to try the Samsung, but I really love it."
yes,yes,yes,"good item, thanks@"
no,yes,yes,I did not receive the right ite5
no,no,yes,"This particular edge note 4 I purchased, never accepts upgrades, so iresponssive to Wi-Fi, lots of system error. I don't recommend."
yes,yes,yes,Outstanding phone! Does everything I need it to.
no,no,no,Junk battery is hot as hell and it's very slow
no,no,no,Critical issues with OS upgrades. Quickly became a rectangular brick. Had to return for refund. This SAMSUNG model was DISCONTINUED for a reason!
yes,yes,yes,The phone did not work at all. I had to buy another phone from Gizmo Trader. There phones are in excellent condition. They don't lie about their phone or anything. So if you are looking for a great phone and people to tell you the truth. Buy from Gizmo Traders and not from Y&E Closeout.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I've ever had just upgraded from a galaxy s4
yes,no,yes,"It's an OK phone. But I bought this as an upgrade for my note 4. Hate I did that. This was a downgrade. But was completely functional, looked great and was as described in the listing"
no,no,no,It's doesn't work anymore
yes,yes,yes,brand new as listed
yes,yes,yes,I still can not dial out on the phone
no,yes,no,had problems and got a refund
yes,yes,yes,Simply put it's my new best friend it works great and looks great
yes,yes,yes,Really happy with this phone. The Note Edge (and Note 4) are the last Note phones to have user replaceable batteries. It is a perfectly capable phone even at a couple years old. The Edge screen is more useful than I thought (it makes notifications much less intrusive).
yes,yes,yes,will NEVER by a used phone again...this thing has a mind of its own
no,yes,yes,Does it come unlocked I want to insert t mobile sim
yes,yes,yes,Love the Phone. Thanks
yes,yes,yes,Super great product. I should have not upgraded to the S6 +. The Plus is great also but I personally like the 5 edge+. I've owned every Note model. Really great as is the Note 3.
yes,yes,yes,Exceeded expectations great item.
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely amazing. This is the epitome of functional. If you're looking for something with limitless customization and ease of access to apps, this is the phone for you."
yes,yes,yes,"As described, excellent."
yes,yes,yes,So far the Note Edge is functioning appropriately. Was able to Transfer most needed Info from my Note 2 via Kies program on computer using Note 2 Backup! Downloaded rest with sync with Google account.
yes,yes,yes,Good product and A+ Saler
no,no,no,"This is my first Samsung phone. I don't usually write reviews for products, good or bad but I felt compelled to leave one for this product. It is by far the worst phone I've ever owned for several reasons. 1. The battery life is horrible, it lasts for less than half a day with minimal use; 2."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, but still learning how to use it"
yes,yes,yes,"Best smartphone out even in January 2016. Removable battery and IR blaster are indespensible features for me. With Straight Talk, I pay $45 for better service than my old Sprint contract!"
no,no,yes,"It's the last model with the edge screen, removable battery & Micro-SD slot"
yes,no,yes,"I love Galaxy Note phones, that's why I purchased this one. I had it in my basket when the price was way higher. When the price dropped drastically I should have known it was used, but I don't believe it should have gone in my basket when I placed a new item in."
yes,yes,yes,"I had an S4 and love it but unfortunately AT&T won't upgrade the os and the bloatware ate up the 16gb. I've always liked the notes but when I saw this I really liked it. Yes it does cost more but I use that edge a lot. I like to keep the real estate open on my phone, I hate the clutter of tiles."
no,yes,yes,"It won't let you go online while talking. Also, trouble with lagging."
yes,yes,yes,"I am in love with my Note Edge. I have had it for a month now and still discovering new things that it is capable of!! Love, love, love!"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is in real mint condition (bought as used item) only a very small spot on the top but doesn't affects anything, the only downsides are that the charger doesn't works and the battery seems to last less than a brand new one, but in general the phone its perfect."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Recommend highly
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone. Works great! Came on time like new.
yes,yes,yes,My wife and I love the phones they are great they are better than the phone I had before this one
yes,yes,no,not work as expected
yes,yes,yes,Excellent smartphone. Will purchase an additional Samsung Galaxy Note Edge soon. Very nice display and speakerphone for talking and listening to music. Very fast uploading and downloading speed. Extremely satisfied. John
yes,yes,yes,it arrived in better condition than expected. it has had a few problems come up over time but still functions for the most part. will definitely buy refurb/used phones from now on.
yes,yes,yes,"Very nice phone, great camera. The size of the screen is good also, why buy a new galaxy when this one is the same."
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely great product! Still learning to look but phone is in great shape, better than initially thought. Came with charger and wrapped securely. Screen is slick and bright. Works well and swift processing system."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone no screen scratches, a minor cosmetic scratch on side. Phone works great. I'm always getting complements on my phone"
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone.It may not be the most updated phone but works great.Love the edge screen..I'm able to set up several apps and contacts..make calls use the browser, camera,messaging, folders and so on with the edge screen. Everything operates smooth and fast."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, wish it had better cases"
yes,yes,yes,"Tons of features, easy to use, nice, big screen with awesome resolution. Camera is great, comparable to the rest of the new phones. I really enjoy it."
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone. The used one I received had a messed up camera and an almost dead battery, but the phone itself is great."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone and handy indeed, love it will recommend it for anyone."
yes,yes,yes,"Why download so fast my note edge, I say it's good, but heats up enough and is discharged very fast. I'm not happy :("
yes,yes,yes,Great style of phone. The battery doesn't last very long and the screen will sometime freeze up.
yes,yes,yes,"ABOUT THIS TYPE OF PHONE (SM-N915): I am a long time, die hard Apple fan and user. I even own a bit of Apple stock. So I approached Android w/ some trepidation. That being said, I LOVE this phone! I've been waiting forever for Apple to come up w/ phablet w/ an integrated stylus. I gave up."
yes,yes,yes,Real like this phone
no,yes,no,The only issue with this phone is the battery have replaced it 5 times
yes,yes,yes,OmG!!!!! this phone is freak'n awesome and the PRICE was eeven better
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone. Although I think some apple's apps work better than android platform (for example, until now I didn't find a podcast app that response very well headset comands, like two ticks to forward x seconds, tree ticks rewind x seconds."
no,no,no,"I love Samsung phones. I’ve owned the Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, S4, and S5 (personal and work phones). If not for the great Droid Turbo, I’d be rocking the Note 4 right now. The Note Edge is the first Sammy Phone I’ve handled in a long time that I do not recommend."
yes,yes,yes,"Thank God , I received exactly what was published , 100 % product described. includes all accessories including the s pen. all original and sealed boxes"
yes,yes,yes,"Pretty pricey but totally worth it. Love the edge screen and I get a lot of use out of it. As someone who started on tablets with a Palm zire 31, the stylus is breathtakingly useful and gives such beautiful results (handwriting, drawing and fine control when needed)."
yes,yes,yes,Good phone. Works very well. Only That I tried registering with Samsung I couldn't
yes,no,no,I really wanted to like this phone but the downsides to it were too significant for me to keep and not return... The battery life on this is not good compared to the other notes. I am guessing this is because of the edge screen.
yes,yes,yes,It's amazing. I absolutely love wide screen and pen that you can write down perfectly.
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone ever!!!!! Love the size, speed, is not heavy at all...."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung... The innovator??... My new Galaxy Note Edge is forcing me to believe so!!
yes,no,no,Tiny edge panel is absolutely useful and fabulous esp. 1. in the gym I can use 'stop watch' without open cover 2. I can see Facebook notification on edge panel without open the cover 3. I can watch YouTube or read email during the phone calls (Phone call status on edge panel) 4.
yes,yes,yes,Poor packaging but a good phone
yes,yes,yes,Loving it. Have had my edge for 14 days now. I will update review after i have it longer. But so far the battery life is amazing. And the quickcharge I am up 50 charge in under 30 minutes. The screen resolution is wonderful and I am loving the menus on the side bar. Wonderful

yes,no,yes,First I got the Note 4 because I couldn't wait for the Edge.. Now I have both and The Edge is so useful having All my apps and folders on the edge. I just flip my thump up or down and press/open done! Makes one hand use a lot easier!

no,no,yes,"Good phone. 1. No much heating problem. 2. Keys(Volume, main menu and on/off button) need to press hard. it should be softer to press. 3. Back cover is fully plastic so it is very slippery. It should have some rubber material so that it will not slip from hand. 4. Camera is 13 and 5 MP."

yes,no,yes,Reviewing this after 3 days use. In terms of look its cool and nice but lacking in features. Battery is performing well. Expecting more from samsung. Here are the cons and pros of this device: Pros- 1. 3000 MAh Battery is good and performing quite well. 2.
yes,yes,yes,"Pros: Display is good, battery is excellent, Camera quality is ok but sound is not good not happy with the sound in the set."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is jus worth buying. Guys go for it. I was damn confused before buying this phone as my past exp with Samsung was not that great. Everyday I was surfing and finding a new phone. When this phone was launched finally i decided to go for this one. Great configuration at this price.
yes,yes,yes,"On7 is budget category but fully featured. I wont talk on numbers but will tell my experience with this one! After using two variants of moto shifted to this On7 for a change. Pros: 1.No drag, lag or frame drops what-so-ever after using few high end games. 2.No heating at all."
no,yes,yes,Good Phone for this price bracket but the screen is very fragile i dropped a 5 rupee coin on the screen accidentally and the whole display is cracked so if u buy this pls handle it with care and also there is no notification LED for missed calls and sms alerts very very fragile display

yes,yes,yes,when i review the features it looks very good with the price range. but after receiving really shocked. charging cable length very less. samsung has to lookinto this and resolve. purchased just 3 days before faced following issues. 1. hanging issue notices like not able to attend the call. 2.
yes,yes,yes,BEST PHONE WITHIN 15K. MUCH BETTER THAN J7 (SILENT PHONE) . DONT GET EXCITED ABOUT J7 16GB AND SELFIE FLASH. COS RAM SHOWS ONLY 400 MB FREE PLACE ALL THE TIME AND SELFIE FLAS ACTUALLY A SPOT LIGHT. IF U THINKING TO BY J7 THEN JUST TRY ON7 : ON 7 WOULD BE A BETTER CHOICE.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone with this price range. 1.5 GB RAM might be the issue but Quad core of qualcomm snapdragon helped to be faster. Display is good. Camera quality is also super cool.
yes,yes,yes,i ordered this phone with certain offers in diwali received phone well before time given. very nice phone good camera. expected ram should have 2gb but its 1.5gb only. normal camera not upto the mark internal memory is 8gb only. both sim have 4g facility this is good one. very slim & light piece.

yes,no,yes,I have used this phone. (1) I agree almost with above view given by my friends 2) But i want to draw few more attention to this mobile:- (a) this set is not having gorrila glass which is normally available at the price of 6000 price also. (b) Cable length of charger is very short.
yes,yes,yes,I opened the box and i was like 'WOW'. The design of the phone is very good and sleek. The touch is also good. The battery backup is too good for WiFi users. I did not check it on the mobile data yet. The item was delivered one day late but that is acceptable because of festive season.

yes,yes,yes,Everything is okay in this phone but the processor. On5 has a 1.3Gz Exynos processor whereas On7 has a 1.2Gz Snapdragon 410 processor. And it heats sometimes. Mediocre RAM space since Touchwiz UI occupies nearly 700MB of RAM.

yes,yes,yes,Excelent quality/price ratio

yes,yes,yes,"It's an awesome phone with a beautiful screen, however I purchased it for the camera and duel sim feature, the camera is mediocre at best, especially when it comes to pictures of pets due to slow shutter time. If your not looking for an awesome camera this phone is perfect and an amazing deal!"
yes,yes,yes,"this phone meet my expectations. . Specially, I use it not much for internet, reader news even watch movie....so all the apps are enough for me but for someone else maybe it is not enough like they expect. Anyway, this phone is great and nice"
yes,yes,yes,I bought this for my special needs son and he just loves it! He said it had better features than my IPhone and bigger than the one he previously had. I'm not sure what that means since I'm not not very phone smart. But overall he is super happy with it!!!

I will not recommend buying from this irresponsible store.cell does not work as it really is NOT international release as stated in the publication is a phone that can only be used in Italy specifically"

yes,yes,yes,"For the price you get a great deal on a really nice phone. Paid 240, which was the cheapest available price. Pros: Original S3 accessories fit even with dual sim Newer version Android available Comes with pre installed screen protector Cons: Pakistan model(which means I had to download Trinidad kit..."
yes,yes,yes,"Very good buy, I am satisfied."
yes,yes,yes,"Fast and optimized TouchWiz, great battery life. it exceeds all of my expectations. Mine is still on Android 4.3. You are able to choose the 2G/3G data on any of the 2 Sims, without swapping it."
no,yes,yes,I could not figure out why my battery would drain and cpu over heat causing the sim card to deactivate. After doing extensive research it seems these phones are known for that. It however is not the phone that is causing it. The problem is the OS it comes with Android 4.3 Jelly Bean.
yes,no,yes,It already comes with a screen protector installed.

yes,yes,yes,"It's an awesome phone, but some features are not surprising/useless. However, it's beautiful, the feel and grip are very nice, the camera is incredible and the screen is breathtaking! The IP68 certification makes you feel safer as well."
yes,yes,yes,"It's an awesome phone, but some features are not useless. However, it's beautiful, the feel and grip are very nice, the camera is awesome and the screen is very good! The IP68 certification makes you feel safer as well."
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone I've owned so far. Display is fantastic as is the touchwiz UI, which I actually prefer to the near stock android I had on my old Xperia Z1C. Performance is very good overall and it blazes through most tasks. Web browsing including videos and downloads is speedy even over 3G."
yes,yes,yes,"After using for a little while, I've concluded this is a good phone, however it feels as if everything but the camera is below premium. The build is noticeably cheap, battery drains quickly despite all power save features in use; however the speed and camera might be enough to convince you."
yes,yes,yes,I had my prejudices against this phone at first. It looks like it was designed by a hobo... but it had all the features i was looking for in a phone. First impression was fine and dandy great camera and dreamy screen. Samsung bloatware is very annoying... the ui was ok for me.
yes,yes,yes,"the phone is a dynamite. Battery is excellent with very heavy use(7-9 hours at least) and the new lollipop touchwiz is beautiful,useful and less laggy. This phone has one of the best cameras out there but the selfie camera has problems."
yes,no,yes,"Regardless of the price, the Samsung Galaxy S5 is one of few flagship phones that seems to be worth the investment. The Snapdragon 801 processor works without a hitch and no struggle with multitasking, despite the TouchWiz interface."
no,yes,yes,"iphone is much better. This phone has some problems, battery drain, Oversaturated screen, Lagging plus overheating and frustrating fingerprint sensor. I seriously considering switching back to iphone."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone with the idea to buy a good flag ship phone this time, instead of buying a cheaper good-enough Windows Phones. Reading all the reviews it looked it was impossible to go wrong with this phone. But I liked it less than my previous cheaper phones."
yes,yes,yes,I brought this phone @ 16000......It is a best phone in this range ......especially its rare camera & RAM
yes,yes,yes,"I remember when the Galaxy S5 was released, it got a lot of bad reviews because of the lack of change and the looks. My wife got the S5 a month ago and everytime I handle it I'm pretty impressed with it. The phone looks better in person . The features are great. I wish my Note 4 was water resistant."
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone. Camera very good. Water resistant and dust proof very good. Fingerprint scanner good. Battery life very good. Display quality exelent. 2 year warrantee. LTE very fast. Front camera quality not bad.
no,yes,yes,I don't recommend this phone to anybody in fact i recommend people to shop for something else instead this phone dies fast always stop responding and acts up if you try to put a lock screen on it will always call 911 for you
yes,yes,yes,"...so maybe I'm just a bit dazzled and won't be able to give as sophisticated a review as some, but I am seriously loving this phone. It does more than I was ever expecting, and it does it so much better than I ever would have thought."
yes,yes,yes,"The Phone is overall a great device. It does what it says it can. It runs very fast and smooth despite Touchwiz and although the camera quality is quite frustrating indoors, the pictures it takes outside or in good light are plain beautiful."
yes,yes,yes,"So i ""was"" a apple person until a few months ago i went to get a new phone, i was super bent on getting an iphone no matter what! But what do ya know i walked out of their with this phone and have had no regrets what so ever!"
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone, I've owned almost every galaxy s phone they have made. Waiting on the galaxy s6 next!!! I am currently using the active because my s5 got lost at a concert. l Love galaxy s phones they are the best!"
yes,yes,yes,A very useful phone for busy business people who are always on the go. Design is not that bad like what other brand fanboy says but not the best. I value usefulness and efficiency over design. Camera is great except in dark but you won't always take pictures at the dark.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my s5, although it has some disadvanteges, it has alot more advantages than disadvantages. Just look at the s5's camera. STUNNING. Or maybe the display. AMAZING. Or even the speed of it. UNIMAGINABLE!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,Just superb performance on antutu banchmark its score 42000 that near to all 45k phones.i got my s5 at 33000 price.this phone is superb in all features. also its water resistance.if someone said u its polycarbonate cover than said them that s5 having nonumber of back cover on official website too.So...
yes,yes,yes,"If you're reading this review, odds are you're probably searching all over the Internet to see whether the Galaxy S5 is really that good. Well, let me assure you, it is REALLY that good! The phone is lightning fast and I honestly could not expect more from it."
yes,yes,yes,"I am using this phone since 2.5 months. Its a complete phone for everyone with its strong sensores, fast performance and intellectual features. The camera is just superb with its amazing blur background function. Its very fast!"
yes,yes,yes,"A very good and powerful smartphone, it's good in all the aspects, i've had it for at least 2 months and i haven't had problems with it, the battery is great last one day in constant usage, the full HD screen is excellent."
yes,yes,yes,"Had the S5 for about 6 months and I love everything about it, the screen is clear, the battery last, pictures are so clear along with videos. The President install health app is also great, you can have your heartbeat rate taken just by placing your finger on the back of the phone"
yes,yes,yes,I many years ago have using the family Galaxy S since the first model to now S5 and I don't have anything I can say that I doesn't like on it. but s5 best phone in world I love its camera.
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone with a lot of features , great camera , great performance , great display , but the design is a bit similar to most galaxy devices , and the battery life is ok but not great . i like the touchwiz but its better to get smoother UI"
yes,yes,yes,Very quick and has a nice display. I love the camera and I thinknow the whole phone is worth it's price and is very durable. I will have it for 2 years and I feel like it is going to last it. The battery is great and charges very quickly. It does feel a little cheap but does not look bad at all.
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone! It's the king of Android devices. Only people who try to draw attention would hate on it! And as for iPhone ... it's never been close to either Samsung HTC or the other High-End Android devices!
yes,no,yes,"I have compared S5 Octa Core phone with Xperia Z2 before buying, there are many features that cannt reach to S5. Camera clarity is superb eventhough it is 16MP. Sound clarity, Display, fingure print swipe and good performance no hanging with 2GB of RAM."
yes,yes,yes,"In the past year I have owned almost every flagship phone that has been released.I am an avid smartphone enthusiast. When I'm not playing with my phone, I am reading articals about phones. I am more than qualified to give a phone review."
yes,yes,yes,"After moving from the galaxy s3 to this phone, its simply incredible. I haven't noticed it slowing down at all. It still competes with the best of the best even months after its release. Its camera is incredible (16 megapixels) as well as its in camera settings."
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung Galaxy S5 is, without a doubt, one of the best purchases I have ever made. I've now owned it nearly 4 months now & have not one negative thing to say about it. I can't imagine any other phone being performing any better.it's very good and I can do everything with my galaxy.big screen is..."
yes,yes,yes,I just love this phone Ultra power saving mode is just simply amzing.I live near Beach so this phone kinda suits me its waterproof phone .I had Iphone 5s but only thing i hate about that phone was horrible battary life thank god i upgraded to this gs 5 phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Just got this GIANT a few weeks ago. LOVE IT. For the past 1.5 years up until a few weeks ago, I owned the Galaxy S2 so, obviously, when I got this phone, I couldn't believe it. LOVE LOVE LOVE how this phone is huge, compared to the Galaxy S2, because it's fits comfortably with my large hands."
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung Galaxy S5 is, without a doubt, one of the best purchases I have ever made. I've now owned it nearly 4 months now & have not one negative thing to say about it. I can't imagine any other phone being performing any better."
yes,yes,yes,the quality of the phone is good the display is great and the camera is great plus battery is great the only thing l fine out is the sound or the call quality is fair . not good of this type of phone at all but the rest of this phone is great indeed
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S5 absolutely is a premium, fast phone that I would buy and use every day. Its improvements over the Galaxy S4 add up to a smoother experience. The phone's high-quality camera won't let you down, there are plenty of features to keep you occupied, and the display is bright and beautiful."
yes,yes,yes,"I took a while to decide what phone to upgrade to. When the HTC one m8 came out I was positive that was the phone for me, I was very unimpressed with its camera. When thever s5 came out, I was disappointed in the gimmicks Samsung took with the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I switched to a S5 from an iPhone 5 and i was happy with my choice until i used my friends Nexus 5. The Nexus 5's stock android experience was smooth, clean, fast, and a lot more user friendly in terms of bloatware because it did not have any."
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing hardware, amazing camera and the best display I've never seen... Stop Build quality: borderline Design: quite good with a nice grip but the special thing is that this galaxy s5 is waterproof (IP67)... the speakers are loud..."
yes,no,yes,"I have using the family Galaxy S since the first model (S1, S2, S3, S4 and now S5), and I don't have anything I can say that I doesn't like on it. I think this last change was the best because my feelings are that I gain more performance from S4 to S5."
no,yes,yes,Only had the phone for 4 hours and noticed the camera lens cover was cracked when I went to peel off the plastic cover.
yes,yes,yes,Overall the phone is great a lot I can do with this phone over my old phone of 8 yrs A long list of people wish there was an updated app to change the one male icon face to a more friendly looking face of both male and female We know about taking photos and replacing the icon with photos some of us...
no,yes,no,"People who want to buy this phone, just go ahead and buy it. You may hear S5 is slow, S5 is ugly etc etc.. As Samsung is a Big D*CK playa in the smartphone industry it is all but natural to get crticism from all sides and fanboyism takes that critcism to trolling."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the design of the phone however touchwize is sometimes laggy. But the super amo-led screen is incredible compared to a device such as an iPhone. Still even now i'm not quite sure whether I'm a fan of the dimpled design of the back panel, part of me thinks to rugged look, but i did try and..."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought the S5 from Samsung Store at metropolis Metrotown Burnaby, bc. had it for a week now seems very good. up to my expectations. My previous phone galaxy S2 LTE was simply too old for me to continue using."
yes,yes,yes,"I was a SONY maniac since the last 7years. This is the phone which made me change my mind to switch to Samsung. Had the option to buy Z2 or S5, & I got the S5. Its been a month since I have been using this phone, and I am very happy with all the features it provides."
no,no,no,"Since the update of KitKat 4.4, unable to connect to a Bluetooth Device. Both S4 and S5 were tried and cannot connect, no patch, no nothing from Samsung. Dose anyone know ho to fix the problem"
yes,no,yes,I just switched from iPhone 5S to the Galaxy S5 and I am loving this phone. Main reason why I switched from the iPhone 5S is because the battery burned and eventually ended up dying on me. So I decided that I am tired of Apple's poor battery life and decided to try out the Galaxy.
yes,yes,yes,"Long time iPhone user that was desperately seeking a change, looked at the note 3 and S5 and decided with this one, had the phone for over a week and regret the decision - Should have gone note 3 (or waited for the note 4) heres why:"
yes,no,yes,I love the fingerprint unlock. It's the best. The only thing I'd like to see different is offering an optional pattern unlock as an alternative instead of the password. The pattern is simpler than a password when one is in a rush to unlock your phone. Maybe this could be added as an option
yes,yes,yes,"I bought my Galaxy S5 about a week ago. I love the screen quality, the colours and especially the Battery life. But the only thing Samsung needs to improve is the storage. With about 5.5 GB of OS and bloatware, The 16 GB model isn't worth it."
yes,no,yes,Overall is best update Big S4 but but brightness this Phone is Perefct and very very better of S4 and this design is cool! i work today by Galaxy S5 just can say Galaxy S 5 without Difficult battery is very Good .
yes,yes,yes,The battery life is amazing! Even using it often i can go 2-3 days not charging it
no,no,yes,This product has many great features. However I need a phone which will enable me to send and receive emails and text messages for my work. This phone will not allow me to send or receive email unless I am in a WIFI zone.
yes,yes,yes,"I thought it would just be a small change from the S4, but after ""playing"" with it for a while one word comes to mind. PHENOMENAL....that is all."
yes,yes,yes,I've been using the Sony Z series for quite a while before I decided to change ship.
yes,yes,yes,"Hey Guys. Having used the phone for about a month, I can say it is one of the best devices on the market. Yeah, it has got competition, but it is an amazing device in its own respect. The phone is very good in practical usage."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone with poor battery life and not enough ram.
yes,yes,yes,"Haters gona hate,It works very smoth there are a lot o features that everybody will be surpised and grateful that samsung has put to make ojr lives easyer and better.You can set it as one handed operation for easy use with one hand ,the display is wonderful very rich in color,the 2.5ghz procesor..."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is pretty awsome. The size feels great I am coming from a note 3 and was a little concerned that i would miss that screen size but i actually like this better. The display is honestly the best I've seen in a phone before and all the features are pretty amazing as well
yes,yes,yes,"Love the features, fan of galaxy series"
yes,yes,yes,Great product hardware wise but some improvements to software has to be made so user doesn't have to search for alternatives.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Very good display, fast processor and good apps. One feature that should be added is wireless charging. ff"
no,no,no,"Not up to the mark, the build quality is bad especially compared to htc one or even nexus 5, the finger print scanner is good idea implemented in a bad way,and the speaker are super tiny, the worst of all touchwiz."
yes,yes,yes,Darsht place that really offers something different to the htc also ridiculed even hurt. The build quality of Samsung phones is really strange and has always insisted on making phones with plastic casing!
yes,yes,yes,I have had an iPhone for the past 3 years and just switched to the Galaxy S5 a week ago. What a difference!
yes,no,yes,"I had an iPhone I HATED. Got the BlackBerry Z10. Always have been a Berry user, nor sure why I tried iPhone guess I'm a sheep, could only handle it for 8 months. I perceive berries as business devices, iPhone were toys. I played more stupid games on an iPhone than anything."
yes,yes,yes,"I am learning new stuff on this phone everyday, I upgraded from the galaxy s3 huge difference :). I use this phone on car mode alot works so great, I can text ( sometimes it doesnt get it right when I speak, but most of the time it does) play music from my phone etc."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is pretty awsome. The size feels great I am coming from a note 3 and was a little concerned that i would miss that screen size but i actually like this better. The display is honestly the best I've seen in a phone before and all the features are pretty amazing as well
yes,no,yes,Very pleased with the Galaxy S5 so far. The display is a big improvement and the battery lasts a lot longer than the S4 even tho the battery is barely bigger. I dont notice a huge difference in the camera quality other than the upgraded HDR mode and the 4k video mode.
yes,yes,yes,"For any busy student in school, this takes care of your busy day with ease. :) Right now, this phone is penny for penny the best one out there in the market. Everything in its operating system runs flawlessly on the 2.5 Ghz quad-core processor."
yes,yes,yes,"To start with, we have a lot of certified reviews about this product and before i start i have a disclaimer , i have not purchased this product but had used it for many hrs as my roomate has brought it at launch and guess what he is a samsung fanboy."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone so far. I have had motorolla's for the last few and they were great. The last samsung I had was terrible (GLYDE). So I was reluctant to get another, but WOW, this is a great phone. I love the screen, the camera, how fast it is."
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone. That's about it. Probably the best phone out there. But it still could be better. I couldn't find the internet browser for instance. I have Verizon, so I don't know if they took it off or something? But it's not there. And I don't use Chrome. Or any others. I like the Samsung browser."
yes,yes,yes,"I've been using this phone for some days. Ans it's just perfect. Really pleased with my choice. I've got to play with the HTC One M8 , and believe me, even thought it's a premium phone, the galaxy s5 beats it hands down when it comes to its comfortable feels."
yes,no,yes,"Been using GS5 for almost a week now and here are my impressions: PROS -Fingerprint sensor works quite well. Now that I'm used to it, my success rate is about 80 to 90% -After a full day (18 hrs) of intense use, the battery is still typically at 40% -Camera is excellent -Feels soft, comfortable, and..."
yes,yes,yes,Overall this phone isn't perfect but it is nearly perfect. Build quality isn't the best but it totally isn't bad. Smoothness and cameras are prime features. And don't get me started on the battery which is amazing. I can last a full day easily
yes,yes,yes,The best built Samsung phone ever! The 16MP Camera is just amazing. And OMG....this Battery!! Where do I even begin!! LOL. This 2800 battery is CRAZY!!! 10 + hours of use and I was at 75%! Awesome!! Overall I'm satisfied with this phone. The only thing is sometimes..
yes,no,yes,"this new samsung galaxy s5 dun have so many improve but this smartphone have a few of reason to buy.First one,this galaxy s5 is water resistant andthen s5 have finger print.more information pls go to check thank you"
yes,yes,yes,"I was debating on why I should or should not upgrade, but I'm glad I did. This phone is awesome. It's fast, battery life is really good and it's not too big for my pockets. It's just perfect for my hands."
yes,yes,yes,After the first couple of days I haven't had one problem which is more than I can say for any other phone. It's more waterproof than advertised and the back feels very nice in the hand. The ability to add expandable storage is great and is blazing fast. Android and TouchWiz finally work togather.
yes,yes,yes,"the best phone i've ever used, nice design, great performance, battery that stay for a 10 hours and a lots of other things. the only thing i hate is the speakrs, it could be better than the current one, but its okay i can live with it"
yes,yes,yes,"I like everything about this phone! The camera is excellent, its water resistant and dust proof, it feels very nice in the hand and it's not slippery, fingerprint scanner works very nice maybe it needs some improvement but overall very nice phone."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a decent spec bump up from the Galaxy S4. Faster processor, better camera, water resistant, and a great screen."
yes,yes,yes,"An awesome phone no doubt, has the best display on the planet, IP67 certification.n BUT,nIn India launched with exynos Octa core version which is quite fast, but the games and apps are better optimised for Snapdragon SoC because it is more popular."
yes,yes,yes,the S5 feel great in my hand as im having a hard time putting it down. the screen is beautiful in displaying colors and anything imaginable. the call quality is something ive never had a problem with. its dust and water resistant which is good for my active life style. no issue with battery life.
yes,yes,yes,Main Drawbacks of S5:nnNO LTE (4G).nNO OIS (Optical Image Stabiliser).nNO FM Radio.nNO Snapdragon Processor.nNO 3GB RAM.nNO Temperature/Humidity Sensor.nNO USB 3.0 CABLE.nnSurprisingly this phone (Indian Version) despite being a USB 3.0 capable device ships with USB 2.0 cable in the box.
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is destined to be one of the best-selling phones of 2014. The S series it belongs to has sold more than 200 million, and if this new version doesn't sell by the truckload, a whole lot of people will be disappointed."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung is just not improving on the build quality. Strong camera and the silicon have the edge here. screen's over saturation is eye popping but unnatural. Waiting for the F series now. A metallic body like that of htc one will perfectly boost the sales of high end devices.
yes,no,yes,Overall is best update Big S4 but but brightness this Phone is Perefct and very very better of S4 and this design is cool! i work today by Galaxy S5 just can say Galaxy S 5 without Difficult battery is very Good .
yes,yes,yes,This product is good. It is expensive but it is a great phone to get the battery life not that good.
yes,no,yes,"This phone has too much Bloatware and useless features. I mean why would anyone need/want a Heart rate sensor on their phone, or a fingerprint reader?"
yes,yes,yes,"Overall is great but the design could be better... There is nothing special for me to say as you guys can find all the reviews on YouTube already... Nevertheless a great phone indeed.... Nice vivid screen, 4G LTE is fast no drop on phone call... Camera features are also great..."
yes,yes,yes,I highly recommend this phone to anyone new to the smart phone world! Beautiful screen display. Loud speakers. Fast browsing off and online. Happy to be the owner of this phone. I can not wait until a new version comes out I can only imagine the improvements - Aref Mrehin.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this now for a few weeks. Quite honestly I can't find fault. I don't play games all day on it so can't comment on performance with regard to that but, all other aspects of use; browsing, mail, text, navigation etc. are superb."
yes,yes,yes,really good quality screen and colours when watching video
yes,yes,yes,"It ships from Europe so it takes about a week to arrive, but if you can live with that, you won't get a better deal."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent service, received quicker than expected, and at a reasonable price :-)"
yes,yes,yes,I have now had this for over a month and am very pleased with it
yes,yes,yes,"I'm very pleased with the phone, arrived as described."
yes,yes,yes,"I am very pleased with this purchase, since everithing went smoothly from the delvery to the device itself. Good value for money."
yes,yes,yes,"Wonderful item, i use it every day and i am so excited"
yes,yes,yes,"Have had this for a fee weeks now, recommended and now my daughter has the same phone. Both pleased with it and still finding fun features to use."
yes,yes,yes,i have only had phone a few weeks but it is great
yes,yes,yes,I bought this mobile phone and happy with it
yes,yes,yes,brought a month ago very happy with the service and the phone
yes,yes,yes,A new review on an old phone which I've resurected as a temporary device (while replacing a new Huawei Mate 9 which is bascially an expensive brick with a nice camera).
no,yes,yes,Junk!
yes,yes,yes,"Waterproofing tech has been out for several years now using vapor deposition technology. What are cell phone manufacturers waiting for? Phone tech is amazing until you take into account Moore's Law - ""The overall processing power will double every two years."
yes,yes,yes,Galaxy S5 is a pretty good phone. It feels good in your hand. Screen is best I have ever seen. After new update the phone lags. Glad it has MicroSD and removable battery. Bought LG G3 same time and the LG tops this in performance. Tired of all bloatware from Samsung.
no,no,no,"s not installed), rather stuck all night. In the morning, the device was hot so I pulled the battery out and let the device and the battery cool down. When I put the battery back in and tried to power up the device, it stuck on splash screen and didn't respond to any key pushes or anything."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought an old Galaxy S5 from a store for about 190 dollars. I must say, I've never used a Samsung's flagship before, and this phone could easily impress me."
no,no,no,"I've had 2 replacements, as both originals failed. The operating system is extremely slow/sluggish, plenty of apps crash, and there is a large amount if ridiculous apps that come pre-installed that you cannot delete from the phone's memory."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a great phone overall, I haven't had any issues with the software and it's a very fun phone to use."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a great smartphone to this day. Amazing display, camera, and battery life make this phone a great buy for students and on the go people. Only thing I wish is that It it had a metal frame."
no,no,no,"I have had many androids, and this one has been the worst. I use my phones to their maximum capabilities, from texting, to data, to downloads, printing, apps, pics, etc. This one can't handle anything!"
yes,yes,yes,"So...my mom got the shaft in batteries. She has the Samsung s5, has kept it in an otterbox the whole time she's had it! Since day one she was pretty much having some issues with the phone - minor glitches."
no,yes,yes,When I called Samsung to see why they stop apps for dyslexics from working. They told me that is what makes it a Samsung phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Galaxy s5 is far better than Xperia Z3 , HTC M8 and LG G3 , check out comparative study"
no,yes,yes,"The ""unique"" function of this phone ""SIM Network Unlock PIN"" makes you a victim of Samsung's market strategy. Just Google how many people asks about this! Unlock? Get ready to pay USD50 every time you change a SIM card in different zone. Get help from Samsung, ""go back to where you bought""."
no,no,no,"I dunked my S5 into the hot tub two times for a couple minutes each time. Both times, I had to remove the battery and dry it out in my toaster over at 150* in order to get the ""headphone"" symbol off the screen and the external speaker working again."
no,no,no,"My Galaxy S5 has problems with bluetooth (look it up, it's a very common experience) to which Samsung has NO FIX. So, just know that if you're having bluetooth audio connectivity problems, they're just going to be there. Samsung released a defective phone!"
yes,no,yes,I would like to say that I upgraded from a S4 but so far the S5 does things more slowly and poorly but in a larger size compared to the S4. I'm already on my second S5 after just days of having it. My S5 has been dropping every call I make and sometimes drops the call before it even dials.
yes,yes,yes,"NOTHING can replace this phone at this time, can't wait till a GS6 with metal edge like Alpha"
yes,yes,yes,My wife has an I phone 6 Plus and I compare the two. The I Phone is thinner and both phones do a great job with all functions. I do not like the Apple reliance on I Tunes to sync the phone. Android automatically syncs all of my droid devices.
no,no,no,I have used the s5 for a couple of months now . It is a shame that Samsung decided a long time ago to put Touchwiz on top of Adroid operating system. it makes the phone very buggy. My phone freezes up atleast 2 times a day.
yes,yes,yes,"I am a traditional Samsung user. I owned S2, S4 then Note 3 and now moved to S5 when I found out that Note 4 isn't ip67 compliant. S5 is overall an amazing phone with excellent battery life (I use Snapdragon BatteryGuru and my phone is averaging 18-20 hours with many social apps running)."
no,no,yes,I bought this phone on the 1st day it came out to USA market in April.
yes,yes,yes,"I had a Samsung Fascinate, which I upgraded to an SIII, which was still working well overall but at times slowing down significantly, when my 2 year upgrade was up, and I've had the S5 since then and I couldn't be happier."
yes,yes,yes,I've had the galaxy s4 and now s5. I really like samsung phones however am disappointed that samsung claims this galaxy s5 is water resistant. I have never tried to test out this feature however I was talking on the phone when it stated to pour here in California two days ago.
yes,yes,yes,"My 2-year old Galaxy SIII hesitates a bit, which I assumed to be in need of a faster processor, more RAM, or both. I expected this problem to be solved with the new S5 but I was wrong; it still hesitates. I don't like the fact that the S5 only allows you to swipe right to get to all 7 screens."
yes,yes,yes,"It's an overall great phone. The fingerprint scanner can be annoying sometimes, but with time, you'll get used to it and it'll become more accurate. Samsung could've worked better on the back speaker. The sound is somewhat unclear. They should've thought of that."
yes,yes,yes,Overall a very good cellphone that performs very well under virtually every circumstance. The stunning display definitely surprised me when I purchased it. I also brought it into the pool a couple times and took perfectly fine pictures with it.
yes,yes,yes,"The GS5 is a fantastic phone that almost perfects everything that the average consumer needs. Along with a slew of returning features from the GS4, the GS5's new matte leather design certainly improves on the GS4s design, but the phone is still plastic.."
yes,yes,yes,"A fantastic smartphone that has an amazing screen, fast processor, good health suite and handles multi-tasking with ease."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the first Samsung Galaxy phone I have owned. I switched from HTC which has been fun, but somewhat disappointing. This phone does NOT disappoint! I was considering this phone vs. the HTC One m8 and the biggest selling points for me was the following:"
no,yes,no,"While this phone performs as advertised, it is not sturdy. The cover for the plug comes off and, while they will fix it under warranty, it take over 10 days to get it back. Without the cover, the waterproof claim is void."
no,yes,no,"My original intention was to give the phone high marks straight across the board...and I'd really like to. I followed the ""progress"" of this phone ever since I read about it on cnet. We were really excited to buy the phone and wasn't disappointed once we received them and got them going."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the performance, experience, s-health, fingerprint sensor, screen resolution, battery, it´s a piece of ultimate tech"
yes,yes,yes,I've had my S5 for over 1 month. I love everything about it. I bought the S5 because it is the ONLY good phone out there with SD card slot and removable battery. But... I have found that battery life is so good I haven't needed to buy an extra battery.
yes,yes,yes,"There is nothing to fault with this phone in my opinion. It is super fast. It looks better than ever without the plastic back, the screen is incredible and the camera is just awesome."
yes,yes,yes,Has replaceable battery and SD card slot (now 128GB capacity). Apple has neither and HTC now only has SD slot. Response in loading and operating apps is outstanding.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from the S4 and the S5 is a major upgrade! I don't know what they did to this screen but it's simply breathtaking. The 16mp camera takes amazing photos that look very professional.
yes,yes,yes,Overall it is a great phone and still can be improved. It has lags that needed to be fixed. The extra features like S Health really give a boost to the phone and I Bellevue they should keep these features.
yes,yes,yes,"If you have a GS4, wait for the 6. This is a great phone, but I wouldn't have upgraded if I didn't leave my previous carrier. Camera is faster than the 4, charging is STUPID FAST (went from 48% to 100% in about 50 minutes), and I can go all day typically on a single charge, leaving me with about 15%..."
yes,yes,yes,"I am very impressed with the newest Samsung phone. Everything works really well. I won't compare it to any other phone, but I can't imagine it can get much better than this. I give it 4 1/2 stars."
yes,yes,yes,"Just got tired of my iphone 5s... ios is stale and old and way behind the ""curve."" Android has come a long way in the last couple of years. I love tech, and there is enough to keep me busy with this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"the big surprise is the GPU,iplugged an MHL adapter""micro usb to hdmi"" to my Panasonic 58e60 led tv,unbelievebal picture vivid colors crisp images its more fun with an adapter than using it with DNLA people are amaze of the quality of picture on twitter or instagram,with a few more apps and tweaks..."
yes,yes,yes,"A great purchase was made with this phone. So easy to set up and use, great quality by samsung with a pretty color (white) to go along with it. Have never had an issue as this phone works as well as expected."
no,no,no,"I see all these positive reviews and quite frankly, this is the worst cell phone I have ever had. It's so slow, all of these pop-ups in the middle of me using it or when I turn it on. Takes forever to go from screen to screen or process a text."
yes,yes,yes,"I really like the Samsung S5. I had another one that kept giving me the ""black screen"" though, so am hoping this one won't do that!!"
yes,yes,yes,Awesome - should've upgraded long ago! I Love it!
yes,yes,yes,Very heavy duty it protects the phone very well. think of it as your phone guarded by its own tank.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and was very easy to set up with my straight talk account.
yes,yes,yes,Works fine came when it said.
yes,yes,yes,"Arrived early! In great shape except 1 little ""ding"" by the charging port. Wish it came with an instruction manual & a car charger since authentic specialty cables are required. Seems to periodically feel very warm on the back but it's functioning great!"
yes,yes,yes,"Shipped on time. Phone looks great, works great, super fast reply to question. My first used phone purchase, and I was leary, but I'm so glad I did! Such a great deal on this phone, I'm super excited! And the fact that they have a warranty is even better! Thank you Purple Cobra :)"
yes,yes,yes,Exactly as described. Sound is distorted when using speaker on calls. Service is great.
no,yes,yes,Overall a great phone at a great price. I had a few glitches and had to turn off the phone and restart a few times but that could have been because I took to a Verizon store to download all my data and found my messages didn't work well under Verizon messenger.
yes,yes,yes,Great product at a fantastic price.
yes,yes,yes,great for the price!!
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great! It takes wonderful photos and videos. Clear and crisp audio as well and easy to use texting.
no,no,no,Had this phone for over a week now and I am still waiting for the SIM card to arrive from straight talk. The product advertised that it came with a SIM card but that is not the case. Maybe someday I will have a new working phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I was extremely skeptical about buying this phone, however it turned out to be a great deal. It's truly a Verizon phone, and it comes with the bring your own phone kit for straight talk. The charger, headphones, and phone came in the original box. Everything works perfectly, and was brand new."
yes,yes,yes,"Great product, great price."
yes,yes,yes,"I got it at 12k after exchanging my old moto g 1st Gen device. Got to say that it was a steal at such a price! We've all heard plenty about the pros and cons of the device, if you still need clarification regarding the phone specs, i suggest you check on youtube."
yes,yes,yes,In one word superb.very attractive looks.after all its samsung
no,no,no,"The phone is heating up a lot. Forget about playing heavy games, even downloading apps from Play Store, charging, browsing, calling etc are making the phone heat up. I upgraded to lollipop, but to no avail."
no,no,no,worst product ever delivered facing problems in the phone and was not able to replace it
yes,yes,yes,"The product looks great. Most of the functions do perform well too. But, looking closely at the model,it looks slightly bent looking from one of the four edges or the corners. I put it upside down on the table & clearly noticed that right-sided edge or corner on the top remains in the air."
yes,yes,yes,Best build quality Best design No heating issues No RAM ISSUES Best quality pictures ... camera is just like DSLR FINGERPRINT sensor works very properly If looking for a high quality phone in 20000 price value . Go for S5 .
yes,yes,yes,"A wonderful phone, great specs and amazing camera which make sense in practicality because of its waterproof and dust proof feature. Now go out tension free and use its like anything challenging the extreme and unpredictable weather conditions :)"
no,no,no,Dont Buy Samsung Mobiles Features Of 12000 rupees Moble is On S5 And Recommed You to Go Moto Mobiles Rather than to Buy Samsung...But this Mobile is suitable for Aged Person not to Youngsters
yes,yes,yes,"It is very useful phone and I bought @ 18k..it is lighter and thinner,so stylish..works very good"
yes,yes,yes,Awesome smartphone at this price.....good features...........
yes,yes,yes,samsung s5 is very good fone. no heating issue in gaming online or offline.and after lolipop update running very fast and smooth and interface is also very good and user friendly. comfortably use with single hand no need second hand. display is HD super AMOLED so no problem about screen.
yes,yes,yes,The phone carries the trust of an international brand with good brand value. Its a flagship phone so expect all top features. Fingerprint scanner works seamlessly unless you become over enthusiastic to move your finger in varied angles and at very fast or slow speeds.
no,no,yes,"Sorry for earlier Review. It was mistake of SIM Provider, who provided nano SIM instead of MICRO SIM. It was my mistake."
yes,yes,yes,"Purchases it for my brother and the phone is as stated in the product page. No issues, everything works fine for him."
yes,yes,yes,"happy with s5..one of the best phone i hav used.gryt camera,gryt performence,gryt battery life...the one thing missing from s5 is 4g but for me 3g is good enough.."
yes,yes,yes,Good but not up to the mark. The battery life drains out like anything. A phone with 21 K should be much more better than this one. Samsung lovers will love this phone.
no,yes,yes,awesome phone but lack of optimization and toch wiz sucks beside it is having 8 core processor its hangs a lot... touch wiz sucks. i rooted my s5 and enjoying its hardware.
no,no,no,"Phone is very low in processing, over heating issue, display hanging issue, Touch responses issues, now things getting complicated they are giving me the new replacement for this phone."
yes,yes,yes,nce and goog product delivery before time thats great packing is also very good and product is also genuine so happy with this purchase
yes,yes,yes,I bought it last month when the price was dropped. It is good and worth for 23000/- I am enjoying it..
yes,yes,yes,Same As Galaxy S5 But 3G (SMG900H) not LTE (SMG900F). Functionality same as 900F But Little Slow. Price Is Relevant. (I bought it for 23K 5 Days Latter It Was For 20K) Seller Highly Recommended.
yes,yes,yes,"last 15day i am using this phone, at starting get some difficulties as i change from iphone to samsung, platform is different, Iphone is more user friendly. now after 15day looks a good phone with feature like heart bit sensor, pressure/tension checks , exercise required as per report generated."
yes,yes,yes,"PROS ---- Nice strong build, Water Resistant (you can wash your phone :P), Dust proof, good camera and battery, awesome display, Sound quality via headphone jack, good processor, expandable memory and swappable battery."
yes,yes,yes,"Beautifully fast and easily beats the A8. Okay, I am a geek yet I seldom pay much heed to antutu benchmarks. What I say is this: use this device for a day and you would never feel it's laggy, hot taking too much space etc. It's helluva intuitive and snappy fast!"
yes,yes,yes,"hi, Guys I want let you know this Samsung s5 is really a good piece The only thing i suggest is don't buy as soon as the product launch in the market , wait until the price drop as that suits the product value."
yes,yes,yes,"I got this for 18K and this makes it a steal, only thing separating this from oneplus or asus was the price range and as it came down to the same price range I was more than confident to buy this."
yes,yes,yes,"Marvellous design nd utilities , usefull features even upgrades to lilipop, only 4 g support is not there but there are many people who still use 2g so 3g connectivity iis good enough as 4 g to catch on will take some time nd 4 G will be expensive also.Good water resistant set but dont unnecessary..."
yes,yes,yes,good but camera issue and price drop 18000 made me angry after one week of buy but still excellent usually 4-5 days it will heat for simple reasons than it adjust to us it's good choice comparing all are looking for samsung these days

no,yes,yes,Will this phone support 4G??
yes,yes,yes,Instead of 'lap top' you are buying a 'hand top' when you get an S5. It is a computer in your hand. It is just a wonderful experience.
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone....just have some problems with battery...It heats up.
no,no,yes,Battery backup is not upto the mark. Saller it takthe taking th
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy S5 comes in two different variants – one with a Snapdragon 801 SoC and 4G LTE connectivity, and the other with an Exynos 5422 Octa Core SoC. So here the question comes, which on is more powerful?"

yes,no,yes,Bought it like 6 months ago and I've to admit this phone is far from what it's price suggests. It lags at times. The phone gets heated up very fast. The camera is pretty cool and the touch is good. Still waiting for even 4.4.4 to arrive even though even lollipop has been released.
no,yes,no,"Please don't buy any Samsung Smartphone Series. I faced lots of problem while using Samsung Galaxy Grand 19082GT. Automatically restart, Hanged, All applications won't work properly. I filed complaints in perherdar, all Indian consumer courts, I mailed to all shopping carts sites."
yes,yes,yes,the price which i paid for S5 in urs was the best n m very much happy... :) :) n awesome as off now???!!!!

yes,yes,yes,amazing phone with great battery life. it may not support 4G but then again 3g is good enough for most people. audio quality is great and the camera is mind blowing although low light photography isn't all that great . battery backup is good and it'll see you through the day.

yes,yes,yes,"High priced phone without 4G , I bought it and thought that this premium phone from samsung will have 4G but to my utter dissapointment it does not have 4G, a feature which even a 9k phone from other manufacturers have ."
yes,yes,yes,Masterpiece by Samsung after Updates
yes,no,yes,Which mobile is better to be buy for me s5 or desire 826 ????
yes,no,yes,"As a previous owner of iPhone, here's why I personally liked the S5. Pros: 1. Bigger and fabulous AMOLED 5.1 inch display with 441ppi resolution truly is vivid and the colors really pop out of the screen! After buying it, I couldn't keep my eyes off its screen for some days :) 2."
no,no,no,Samsung Phone Network is really very bad . I am using SII and S5 . I am facing lot of network issues like 1 > Cell switch . From One room to another room if I move I will get call drop or no signal .
yes,yes,yes,Oneplus2 and Samsung galaxy S5 are two flagship smartphones by their respective companies. The reason I have posted this review is because as on this date (31st Oct) these two phones are priced at approximately the same price range.(s5-22k and oneplus2-25k).
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is loaded with sensors,the 4k camera is also superb though 128gb is required for such 4k video recording, the pedometer sensor is also good ..tracks the distance walked, its a great deal within this price range .cheapest 4k mobile in the market.. it also takes good still photos.."

yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone at this price tag.. Usp of this phone is its rear camera.. clicks some amazing pictures.. i am really pleased with this product..only drawback is its front facing camera and finger sensor.. u will get used finger sensor within few days .. but altogether its a gr8 buy..
yes,yes,yes,It works fine but look is not impressive.
no,yes,yes,"Don't ever buy this stupid phone. Buying this phone is my biggest regret ever in my life. In the first few days it works fine but later on it automatically turns off on itself, takes too much time to open even basic apps like facebook, instagram etc."

yes,yes,yes,"The S5 is a little big and a little slow (compared to my S4 mini), but it's an excellent phone, and I'm happy to have been able to find one at a discount because it's a couple of generations older than current. The water-resistance is an especially welcome feature."
yes,yes,yes,can i get this cell phone on installment basis and that to without any emi.if possible try pass the information
yes,yes,yes,Great phone with good price
yes,yes,yes,It is a nice & beautiful phone but over priced. The price is not justified in comparison of other makes premium phones.
no,yes,no,The above described phone may pose like the quad-core 4G model but it is actually the Octa-Core Model. VERY disappointed .... mistook it for the 4g model but its the 3G model! the one with 8-Cores...... very misguiding!..
yes,yes,yes,"I booked it at 9 pm in the evening and by paying just 99 rs extra I got it very next day at 1 pm...yes, its true...And the phone is one of best things i used till now...I m falling in love with it day by day..."

yes,yes,yes,Not the best phone out there. Battery didnt last more than 6 hours Fingerprint is very difficult to use(dosent work mostly unless you swipe dead center iPhone is better at this) Heartrate sensor(the most inaccurate feature.Cardiio app is better at this available for any phone) Feels cheap (made of...
yes,no,yes,Every thing is a charm but the sound quality is really a disappointment. The phone is loaded with lots of feature and sensors. But the single speaker at back produces noisy and low volume sound with almost no bass. It really annoys one if listening to music
no,yes,no,"Please don't buy any Samsung Smartphone Series. I faced lots of problem while using Samsung Galaxy Grand 19082GT. Automatically restart, Hanged, All applications won't work properly. I filed complaints in perherdar, all Indian consumer courts, I mailed to all shopping carts sites."
yes,yes,yes,If only it was cheaper. Has all the features one needs in a phone of his dreams. I cant afford this.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone.... Excellent screen... Dont think just go for it....worth every penny... Fun to watch HD movies and games on its beautiful screen...
yes,no,yes,This is the sexiest phone I could ever get. But you could have kept the price around 35k and given some 3g offers etc.. along with it.
yes,yes,yes,"WHAT IS NEW HERE 1.Sturdy & Stronger Samsung Galaxy S5 comes with dust and water resistant feature that will protect your smartphone from getting damaged from rain, sand and dust. So plan an adventure trip and carry your handy companion along in water or sand without worrying about any damages."
no,no,no,This is an Indian model S5 (SM-G900H) not having a quad core 2.5ghz snapdragon processor as they have mentioned in there description also battery drains faster when connected to a Wi Fi or a 3G network and the device is getting heated up after an hour of use.
yes,yes,yes,Good phone in this price renge
yes,yes,yes,Best phone with all the features.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought the phone when it was 13999. The phone runs really great. The only two major cons are: 1)The speaker is paced at the back which is not the best experience while watching a video,else it's fine for calls/alarms etc."
yes,yes,yes,Original product
no,yes,yes,Its been a month i bought this phone .Facing ghost touch frequently
yes,yes,yes,Awasome Phone Super Camera perhaps best usder 25000 phones Nice Touchwiz UI Update with with Android 6.0 Lots of Sensors Enjoying a lot :)
yes,no,yes,Pros.- S5 have awesome display Good camera Best in 1600 Rs.0 (14000/- my buying price in offer) Cons.- Heating problem in minimum use And a small problem I faced that wifi was not activats properly but after factory reset Its solved but heating problem is going on Conclusion.

yes,yes,yes,"Product is good but some time hit and battery is very low rather than say 2800 mah ,seem it look like 2000 mah"
yes,yes,yes,Really good all round phone with great cam and battery life. No clue why the rating is so bad. Been using it for almost a week now and it works great. But you are caught up in the 4g hype look elsewhere.
yes,yes,yes,"To be fair, I was using s4 previously, and this is just a step better. A slightly larger screen, much better camera and a vry wide angle selfie camera. All good for now. Let's see in future"
yes,no,yes,Although i could not find any cons but the only con is battery backup which can be increased with the power saving mode.
yes,yes,yes,Want to buy again.

yes,yes,yes,Value for money now!
yes,yes,yes,Great camera which surpassed other new phones today as well. Battery back up is decent. Water and dust resistivity makes it more durable unlike delicate phones of this generation. Super amoled display makes watching videos more pleasant. Front camera sucks so it's not for selfi lovers.
yes,yes,yes,150% value of money... only thing is that this phone doesn't come with 4g... bt i can live without 4g... as airtel 3g at its best... So its a steal deal if u dont prefer 4g phones

yes,yes,yes,only cons little bit over heating battery drain ( but can be reduced using power saving modes after marshmallow update0
yes,yes,yes,Excellent value. Ordered this phone when the price came down. Exchanged my old nexus 4 and got it for 12349rs. An unbeatable price for this phone. Better than buying some midrange handset. I'll list few points I've observed instead of writing about specs. Out of the box it came with 4.4.2 kitkat.

yes,yes,yes,"I just bought this awesome device 9 or 10 days ago and i have no regret in my decision. It has functions even better than the i phone 6s.

yes,yes,yes,Update to android 6 Great phone Works like champ ..................... ...................... .............. ..........................
yes,yes,yes,"Well at 17k this phone is a steal. Though a 2 yrs old model, it still will give the other phones a run for their money. The equation is simple. 2 yrs back this ph was a flagship model, so it obviously has all the features of a flagship phone."

Display, processor, call quality are excellent. I wish battery backup was more. I don't care about 4G as even 3g reception in India is terrible."
yes,no,yes,"camera,display, touch sensitive are suppeb ,sound low but ok, No hang ,little bit samsung UI lage Battery avarage continue use to take 5 to 6 hours end of battery, or normal use to take 10 to 11 hours end of battery , so battery is ok Charging not so fast but quick charge the battery to take 1:30-2..."

yes,yes,yes,"Loved the features for its price. Far better than, other new brands with no after sale service. Samsung is reliable.

yes,yes,yes,"i got this phone for 17999 18 days ago, as a upgrade from s4 to s5 ..!! good thing about the phone is that it is water resistance but, it fails in terms of look and even the display dont seemed to me as good as sgs4."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone only for 15500 rs (discount plus 3000 rs exchange offer of my old phone) Pros - 1. Excellent Camera 2. Excellent Screen 3. Very good finger print scanner Cons - 1. Heat too much even with minimum 5-10 mins of activity.
yes,yes,yes,I previously had the Snapdragon variant of S5 so my review would be a comparison to that model. 1. Performance : it's more or less same on both. 2. Battery : I have to say the snapdragon varia t gave me better battery compared to this about 40 min more screen on time. 3. No 4G.
yes,yes,yes,"i wanted to buy a cell phone within 16k, with all features such as ir, fp reader, nfc and all, i dont use 4g so that dint matter at all to me, i got this phone on Samsung day for 18k, gave one old device in exchange and price dropped to a cool 16.5k further applied a gift voucher i was saving and..."
yes,yes,yes,this phone has very good features and is good at this price. but there is a problem of call droping on this handset. hardware is good and also the samsung features are good to use. But overall there is no use of phone without proper calling quality.
yes,yes,yes,i am really a lot into tech and this phone proves to be the best thing ever to me i was concerned of being an android user from long that i would have to root it for most of the functions but to my surprise most of those functions came inbuilt because of that i have not rooted it yet The camera is...
yes,yes,yes,I am writing this review after 6 days of usage. I went with this phone even after 1.5 yrs of it being launched because at 22k this was a deal hard to resist. So here is my review : Display : Just beautiful.
yes,yes,yes,Oneplus2 and Samsung galaxy S5 are two flagship smartphones by their respective companies. The reason I have posted this review is because as on this date (31st Oct) these two phones are priced at approximately the same price range.(s5-22k and oneplus2-25k).
yes,yes,yes,Pros: SD slot Value for money water proof above average soc better battery life in this segment Cons: Less development support (for custom roms/kernels ) no 4G (4G is not useful in india for now though) Always look at CERTIFIED BUYER tag before reading reviews as many of them can be paid for/against...

yes,yes,yes,It's a little long but worth reading if you're planning to buy the galaxy s5 Ok first things first: I'm using the device on android kitkat as of now because I liked it more than lollipop and I've heard lollipop still has some bugs..
no,no,no,Don't buy this product if you think its a water proof or water resistance phone...i have dropped it water for 5 second and phone got dead all part got damaged by water than Samsung didn't took it in warranty + repairing cost was more than the actual phone cost ..pathetic service by Samsung
yes,yes,yes,"little bit battery discharges fastly if u operate heavily, otherwise everything are good. super camera and display. satisfactory."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone at 22k but no 4g feature. Its not completely waterproof as water enters through headphone jack and says headphone connected.
no,no,no,"bought near by a week , the main problem i faced every single day is heating problem , when browsing net and while playing game it turns to fire ball and it's said that water resistant , bt not actually in drizzling rain , water was gone frm the headphone port , so how they declare s5 as a water..."
yes,yes,yes,Been using it for few days everything is working fine until I updated to Android 5.0.1 it started to lag and overheat like hell.So guys do these steps to fix lag and overheat. Disable every unnecessary bloatware u don't want to use from Settings.
yes,no,yes,bought this phone for 22000 scored 45000 on antutu benchmark pros: 1.the screen is amazing 2.the finger print scanner is pretty fast 3.ultra power saving mode will be usefull 4.smart remote is awesome 5.camera is good with a lot of options 5.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent battery life and great performance as long as the mobile runs on Kitkat. After reading about numerous Lollipop-related issues on the S5, I've told my wife to hold off on the update. Camera quality and charging times are also top-notch considering it's a 2014 flagship."
no,no,no,it has overheating problem.when i start my camera to make video it stops working after giving error that keep the mobile for rest for cooling. its screen gets so much heated.
no,no,no,Very Very Poor Battery performance after Lollipop Update.. Not even lasts for a day. Feel like cheated by Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,VERY NICE PHONE WITH LOADS OF FEATURES. A must buy product. Nice phone by samsung. Go for it. Using it from past two weeks and facing no issues till now.
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone 2 days back.simply superb features.little bit heating issue but with gr8 specs . no more FM RADIO and LTE.

yes,yes,yes,"Bought this phone under a recent promotional activity using SBI card for 18000 rs. Great display,smooth UI,good camera. water resistant feature is icing on cake atleast in monsoon season. No 4G, this being old phone, but other features along with samsung after sale servicing makes it a good deal"
yes,yes,yes,"Pros: 1. A great camera with really fast focus and for people who don't want to fiddle with the more complicated camera features, the auto mode captures beautiful pictures instantly. Videos are full HD and lag free. 2. Fast. Browsing the internet and watching videos is a breeze."
no,no,no,"Facing issues even on the basic phone functionality of calling. It gets heated up and performance is also very low, needs a format every 2 months."
yes,yes,yes,"Only problem was google talkback was on, and was annoyed completely when i turn on the device, took some time and turn that thing off. And about the device screen is awesome, call quality is superb, camera average, not using fingerprint, good part is i can expand the storage which is hard to find..."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic screen Still one of the best cameras around Now updated to Android 5.0 Lollipop Update has improved fingerprint sensor Better battery life than S6 Has microSD and water resistance
yes,yes,yes,"A good product, no wonder being a flagship smart phone. This is a 3G version S5 and I got the Copper Gold version for my sister. Since we were using the Titanium Bronze Tab S, she wanted to have a similar looking phone. Samsung Galaxy S5 is exactly like a smaller version of the Tab S series."
yes,yes,yes,"Finally writing the review after hours of sleepless night hunting for good phone since am not phone freak and does not believe in spending huge amount in cell phones. After Zeroing in Aqua M4, Galaxy S5, HTH 826, Chinese make(MI, Xiaomi etc) decided to settle on risky downgraded Samsung S5 with sole..."
yes,yes,yes,its loaded with features and everything but you get a feeling that this phone can do a lot more but samsung has restricted it a lot by designing this in its own way. battery backup is terrible.
no,no,no,the battery life is around 5 hrs and the phone got hot in just 2 to 3 min the samsung worst phone don't buy it its a wastage of money
yes,yes,yes,"PROS: # AN EXCELLENT DISPLAY: Still standing tall even after 1 year of its release, packs an incredibly sharp display at 432 ppi good color reproduction & high contrast ratio, coupled with some tweakings at the settings."
yes,yes,yes,"S5 is still a decent phone Pros : though plastic but build quality is excellent and robust. excellent display addons like heart rate sensor , infra red , finger print lock support are good to have , if you use it. Average : 2Gb ram is normal in 10K range also."
no,no,no,samsung galaxy s5 worst product so many issue after update wifi not connecting heat problem call attending problem
yes,yes,yes,"This is an amazing phone with tons of features loaded in it. Blindly go for it.you wont features in any phone at this price range. all i have to say is ""Samsung its not a name, its the Brand ""."
yes,yes,yes,All the USP are functioning at their best. Everything is just awesome. Sooner I turned my cell on their was notification of system update of more than 800mb which turned 4.4 to 5.0. But for this product I have waited 5 days. Why cant our place get faster delivery options.
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased during the big app sale and got the mobile for around 21k (all offers combined) which is a great value for money now. Regarding the performance so far, i am impressed with it."
yes,yes,yes,got the gold edition. Deliered in 2 days. Looks gorgeous and performs briliantly. Do't even think about getting this phone. Just buy it. Its totally worth it. Much better than nexus or any samsung's a5 or a7.
yes,yes,yes,I bought it for Rs.20999. It is best in class smartphone at such a low price. I agree that it cant beat iphone but at this price it is best and also better than mi4. Pros:- Damn good camera Best battery back up Charges from 0-100% nearly in 90 mins No heating issue at all Excellent call quality Best...
yes,no,yes,"PRICE : 25999 INR ORDER DATE :31-05-15 DATE OF DELIVERY :06-05-15 PLACE : TRIVANDRUM +IVES NO LAGS, UI LOOKS AWESOME , FINGER PRINT SENSOR WORKS COOL, OUTSTANDING CAMERA ,BUILD QUALITY IS AVERAGE, WATER PROOF,ULTRA POWER SAVING MODE IS TRANSCENDENT & THE HEART RATE SENSOR IS ALSO WORKING WELL."
yes,yes,yes,"Just Like all Samsung Phones, the UI of Galaxy S5 is also Laggy but that's probably the only flaw I could find. The phone is fast, has a great camera and runs all high end games flawlessly. On top of that it has about 30 hours of battery life on heavy usage."
yes,yes,yes,"People complaint its not 4G, So think now how many of you use 4g. Its exynos not bad in fact good as S6 exynos is No.1 right now. No one can say its slow as it support all games run flawlessly even on lolipop as well as kitkat. Camera is great too."
yes,yes,yes,What's good ? (Exynos variant) 1. Audio Processor by Wolfson 2. Octa-Core processor with Heterogeneous Multi-Processing 3. Wifi - Broadcom BCM4354 chip supports 2x2 MIMO 4. Network - Intel XMM6360 modem for HSPA+ 42Mbps 5.
yes,yes,yes,"Oh i Love this Phone.. wow..!! been using it from almost 3 months now. n its AMAZING. Let me remove few misconceptions. 1. People have been talking about processor been different: Yes it is true, but it is of much use when you are into very heavy usage. else it works just fine. 2."
yes,yes,yes,"yes i got it for 20.8k after paying for same day delivery chargers .... everything looks good but phone is not that smooth ,i have used it in some mall also but the flowless smoothness is missing from phone dont know why"
yes,yes,yes,"I think in may 2015 no other phone can beat s5 in performance to price ratio. Only real competitors are Oneplus one or Mi4 but they dont have services in small cites so value for money only goes to s5. phone call quality excellent, camera excellent, display outstanding and all lollipop features."
yes,yes,yes,I bought S5 a week back and I have been using it everyday and I must say its a brilliant hardware at a price range of 26-28 k. Initially I spent almost a month researching in detail about various phones in the price range of 22k-28k.
yes,yes,yes,I am using S5 for 8 month and this one i brought again for my wife . I am using s5 for 8 month its a top noth phone. At the price range of 29 to 32 k its a steal. No phone at this price range can be compared with it.
yes,no,yes,"i bought samsung s5 5 months ago...its working awesome....i played most of the big game like assasian creed ,gta, etc....and its working without any problem.but while playing games the mobile got liitle bit heat...."
yes,yes,yes,"Since I am using this phone from last 3 months, I have came across a very good experience. Firstly a very good design unlike any other mobiles especially headache Sony Secondly mobile is fast and never hangs Thirdly."
yes,yes,yes,Good for price 32K but plastic body around the edges does not have good quality. Samsung should have been gone for metal body at least along side edges
yes,no,yes,Now its been months ( launched in Feb 2014) since its launch and price has come down at a level where the its hardware offered by Samsung is justified at current price of Rs 32k. Phone is running smooth despite the fact that most of the RAM is already used by its bloatware.
yes,yes,yes,"I knw people were unsatisfied with this phone before because of its price and no 4G support.But now at 30k, it's worth it. I could have bought moto g(2nd gen) or nexus 5 but i wanted a featured pack phone with Samsung touchwiz. Con."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung galaxy S5 is undoubtedly the best phone in its range. I have been using it for more than 4 months now and am extremely satisfied with it. The 4 things to talk about here is 1) The battery Life: You never have to think about charging it during the day if you charge it in the morning or...
yes,yes,yes,Awesome feeling to use this product. Very Happy.........................................................................
yes,yes,yes,i brought this mobile last week...........it's simply super....but here review are says....it's not worth at price......hands on review......display 10/10....battery 7/10........processer10/10 IR REMOTE 10/10....sound 7/10.....totally 4.4/5
yes,yes,yes,this product was cheaper than the market rate and received the same before time giving the surprise element to me. really happy
yes,yes,yes,truly Galaxy s5 stays up-to my expectation. wonderful phone; and worth buying it.... though the flip cover is good sometime access to volume control buttons is difficult
yes,yes,yes,"S5 has it all what you are looking for in your smartphone..simple the best in the business. excellent features, outstanding performance..if u can afford & willing to buy don't go through all the bad comments just go for it n njoyy..highly recommended !"
yes,yes,yes,"amazing phone. great speed. great camera (best that samsung has made so far), good performance cpu gpu wise. samsung has always been the best with cpu gpu performance. i do not know how people manage to get their phones to hang. i have never had a problem with samsung."
yes,yes,yes,"Yes, i am a proud owner of the product finally getting my hands over the beast phone. Don't know much why people are giving -ve reviews guess they don't have it otherwise they won't review that bad, i m a Apple lover and currently having all models of the iPhone whether 4,4s,5,5s have used all of..."
yes,yes,yes,"It is a nice mobile, but i m totally happy with it. First of all, it hangs when i play games. Even subway suffer don't run nicely. Secondly, it get heated up easily, while charging and playing games. And battery runs around 12-14 hours. Its camera is superb, other functions are also very nice."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought samsung galaxy s 5 about 20 days ago and it is working pretty well, i still dnt get it why people criticize this phn soo much......if u ask me this phn is among top 5 phns in the market with best in class display and 2nd best camera after z2..."
yes,no,yes,"Bought it for 34.5k. Worth it. Better than any flagship at the moment. Loudspeaker sound could have been better, might because of water proofing. Less junk preferable."
yes,no,yes,jst d bst ph which i had seen ol through my lyf bst feature is dis dt it conatins 16 mp camera nd heart rate sensor and olso its blue colour i jst luv it :)
yes,yes,yes,It has severe heating and hang issue... my canvss 4 had been better than this when comes to gaming experience.. 50k seems very hyped price however 36k seems to be ok ... I did not anything WOW in this mobile its very same like other galaxy predecessors...
yes,yes,yes,Using it for last 2 months. I bought it for much higher price but no problem i am gonna use it till S6 comes in market. Loved everything on this phone. Gorgeous display and awesome camera. The best thing of this phone is the camera. True iPhone camera killer.
yes,yes,yes,mobile was good i like the copper gold colour. mobile was better to view processer speed is nice slim and weight less samsung good product and apllication is good to have product and very comfort able camera was not good
no,no,no,This phone has lot of sensors and all advancements but the problem is it gets heated if it is operated in a non AC atmosphere even at 27 degree. While surfing internet even on 2g or only whatsapp..it starts heating abnormally...and the battery goes down very fast.
yes,yes,yes,"My previous phone was a S2 which lasted over 2 years. it finally died on me, hence had to buy a new phone urgently without a chance to wait. being from Mumbai I wanted a water resistant phone since that according to me is a very big Plus. So my only options were S5 vs Song Z1 and Z2."
yes,yes,yes,"i used this device almost two weaks the phone is great decent battery good performance and it is also a water proof phone and i used in a rainy days phone works well and the display is awesome watching movies,videos in full HD without any lag and you will play all games available in play store but..."
yes,yes,yes,"Those cribbing against it are non users, ask me I have 3 of these and happy with all. Only thing that bothers is Samsung does not make available full accessories at same time as these flagship models are released."
no,yes,yes,Pros best screen good software voice recognition is good many usefull software overall good cons worst speaker worst head phones instead of 3.0 usb 2.0 usb cable many useless softwares for 36k it is costly
yes,yes,yes,I am using Samsung Galaxy series phones for last 3 years. Previous one was S4. This S5 is the best of its series. Lots of advance features of the phone makes it worthy. Gifted to my sister. My advice to new buyers is go by genuine buyer's comments as well as genuine user's advice.
yes,yes,yes,"I have this product,there is nothing wrong in this i don't know why people are blaming.Heating is not a big problem its normal for a electronic device. for me its good one for following reason 1 battery backup for average use 1.5 days 2 camera 13 mega pixel is v good 3 super amoled full hd screen is..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great smartphone, ultimate camera, S Finder is awesome, Fingerprint Scanner thumbs up, in all excellent at around 36k Rs Additionally, eye catching features of samsung."
yes,yes,yes,"Very nice phone with all features.Nice build, nice battery backup. Features are awesome. Carmera are excellent. Value for money."
yes,yes,yes,"Did a lot of review reading before buying a Samsung S5. The one's considered were HTC one, Apple and Google.. Found HTC looks amazing only thing which didnt let me buy it was bad camera reviews.. When i am buying a 50k phone I wanted everything in it.."
yes,no,yes,"Although it was initially priced very high, the price depreciated well in a very short period. Bought it for 39k and felt that it was worthy phone than it's counterparts which are currently priced at higher levels at this point of time!"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone Dont go on bogus review i use iphone 5s and Galaxy s5 No match for performance ! Buy with ease!
yes,yes,yes,"Disclaimer: I brought this phone as I am a developer and geek. Main Pros: - Slightly Bigger screen and battery. - Fingerprint scanner. (Not as good as on iPhone 5S) - IP67 Certified - dust and water resistant. - USB 3.0 port. (BUT, No USB 3 Cable in the box!!!) - User replaceable battery."

yes,yes,yes,"I've had the S5 before, and when I broke mine I wanted the same model. The trouble was choosing the right seller! I researched thoroughly and then decided on this one. The reason I haven't posted a review before now is because I wanted to use it for a few months first."
yes,yes,yes,Oneplus2 and Samsung galaxy S5 are two flagship smartphones by their respective companies. The reason I have posted this review is because as on this date (31st Oct) these two phones are priced at approximately the same price range.(s5-22k and oneplus2-25k).

yes,yes,yes,Premium phone at the best possible price now. I got mine for 14.5k. Upgraded to Marshmallow 6.0.1. Great battery and rear camera quality. The hardware is old but still better than Moto G4 or G4 Plus. The phone has an IR blaster to control all appliances from the phone itself.

yes,yes,yes,"Pros: -Comes with memory card slot, IR, good motion sensor. - Good options provided in camera Cons: - Battery drains really fast - There is a closed cover for charging socket, that means every time you want to charge you need open the cover. This is bit annoying."

yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone... great crystal clear display.. 16mp camera crystal clear images nd video recording is 4k but uses lot of space so I prefer 1080@60fps... And 432ppi outstanding pixels for watching videos... Overall awesome phone.. and got marshmallow update. ..

yes,no,yes,Been using it for bout a month and it started make me regret my decision. Pros. •Camera is only good thing in this phone (rear) Cons •It doesn't support touch fingerprint you have to swipe down to make it recognise your finger! It doesn't recognise your finger 70% of the time.
no,no,no,Should have taken the moto x expensive even with 70 % off.. the front camera is pathetic
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone with awesome camera..... But the thing is we can't use Jio in it. Worth buying s6 and s7

yes,yes,yes,"Worth at its performance. S5 Indial model Galaxy_S5_SM-G900HZWA. Snapdragon processor mainly supports 4G. If people hate phone just because of Snapdragon, then they need to fight with Government to bring 4G across india."

yes,no,yes,Its really bad that you make your flagship with such a low quality and like to grab the market share.....i am not a follower of any brand here but the bloatware in the o.s and delicate hardware are not people are expecting from a flagship series...
no,yes,no,"Please don't buy any Samsung Smartphone Series. I faced lots of problem while using Samsung Galaxy Grand 19082GT. Automatically restart, Hanged, All applications won't work properly. I filed complaints in perherdar, all Indian consumer courts, I mailed to all shopping carts sites."
yes,yes,yes,"- Camera Features are excellent. - Screen quality is the best one. You can see each pixel and each color very clear. - Value for money now, as now the price gets reduced to 36K. - Faster performance compared to S4"
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone at 34k.....yes there is no 4g....but do u remember this the 3g is not successful in india

yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone for a little under 2 years now, and I'm reviewing this phone as it stands compared to current new phones.

yes,no,yes,I have been using this new s5 for almost a month. Like the vibrancy of the screen and the speed of the processor. Don't like the volume settings as they are too low for me. Had to find an app that fixed this problem.

yes,yes,yes,Awesome very good phone i recommended for everybody

yes,yes,yes,"Only my first day with it but so easy to figure out, the camera is great."

no,yes,yes,"Hardware-wise this phone was excellent for its time. Software-wise, it weighs down otherwise outstanding hardware. TouchWhiz is slow and laggy. That's easy to fix by downloading a third party launcher. It has too much bloatware."

yes,no,yes,"This phone is so much more than a phone. I have personalized this phone, it's so much more than a phone. I have all my contacts including family, favorites, doctors and so many more. My calendar holds all mine & my family's appts. Sending messages is a breeze."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone and I love the Samsung company.i have had great service.over the years I have had other brand phones but always seem to come back to samsung

yes,yes,yes,Not super fast or inexpensive but a very solid phone
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone overall, the features are great, speed is very nice. I wish the battery life was a little better than what I experience, but not enough to make me not like the phone"
yes,yes,yes,Easy to use. More power than I need. Cheeper than I phone and does more
no,no,yes,The biggest and most important problem with my S5 is when using it to take photos outside is the dark screen. It is impossible to see what I am taking a photo of. It doesn't matter if I am in the shade or complete sun.
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy S5 is a great phone. Had good volume. Games are on point. And the features are amazing. Also I love how it keeps track of your steps daily. You can measure and keep track of your heart rate.
yes,no,yes,I like the s5 I am very dedicated note 4 user and the s5 is very similar just no s pen
yes,no,yes,I previously had a Note 2 and thought it was awesome I'm not getting that same feeling from the S5. I switched carriers from Verizon to AT&T so it may be a combination of the phone and the carrier. However I am going to upgrade to a newer note product either the Note 5 or the Note 6.
yes,yes,yes,Love my new Samsung 5. I only have a Nook tablet and would dearly love to own a Samsung tablet. I can't even take pictures on my tablet. Maybe I will get lucky and win one. One can dream!!!
yes,yes,yes,The only thing wrong us I have an S5 not S7. So hopefully I can get one of those soon.
yes,yes,yes,"It's a great device. It is faster and smoother than the Galaxy S4 but it could be better. But overall, water resistance, micro SD lot, and USB 3.0 are all great features. The display is great and the heart rate monitor seems very accurate. The swipe fingerprint could've been better."
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from the S4...This phone takes awesome pictures and holds a charge .
yes,yes,yes,"I love samung products, I have always been a fan. Cant wait for the S8!"
yes,yes,yes,"It is really a great phone but as always. They are some issues that could be better, but all in all I would buy it again"
yes,yes,yes,I've had my S5 for over 1 and half years.. I love everything about it. I bought the S5 because it is the ONLY good phone out there with SD card slot and removable battery. But... I have found that battery life is so good I haven't needed to buy an extra battery.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is leaps and bounds faster than my s4 was... and I was in love with my s4!!! Better performance, better speed, etc. I love the Shealth app tracking for my workout, love the battery life, expandable memory, phone is great."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone was planning to get the S7 but I have to.try this first and I'm not disappointed by its performance and.features.
yes,yes,yes,Love the feature where you hit the home button twice and it will give you the Svoice feature.Really miss that on my new phone S6 Edge Plus. I am tempted to go back to this one.
yes,yes,yes,I tried other brands of mobile and it has it fixtures but samsung been updating their fixtures pretty good.
yes,yes,yes,Very easy to use even I can navigate around it easily
yes,yes,yes,The removable battery is a great plus. It last for a long time unless you drop it. There are some overheating issues but overall it's a good phone. Samsung's are great phones in general.
yes,yes,yes,Fashionable and functional. Easy to learn and use for this Baby Boomer.
yes,yes,yes,Everyone should have Samsung smartphones. I've had no problems whatsoever. Easy to use and worth the money.
yes,yes,yes,"Overall, the Galaxy S5 is great! It was the last galaxy phone to have both a removable battery and SD card slot. Speed is good, performance is good, and quality is good. It features a nice HD display. The camera is also great in good lighting, but not so well in dark lighting."
yes,yes,yes,"Good graphics, colors and preformance. Recommend this product."
no,no,no,Mine stopped working in less than a week. The screen would turn black and you could hear that it was responding but you couldn't see anything. When restarting IF you could see the screen it would try to boot 5 times before successfully booting.
yes,yes,yes,It's nice and very easy to use. Just has a few little errors like doesn't hold much storage.
yes,yes,yes,"This product is quite functional. I like the fact that all the apps I need are always at hand, are easy to use. And the view is amazing."
yes,yes,yes,It's ok but no fr shatter proof 100 % like I believe it should be

yes,yes,yes,I have been a long standing fan of Samsung phones. Been having since S3. All features are great except for the battery life. It heats up fast and drains quick as the usage progresses.
yes,yes,yes,"I really do love this phone, it does everything I need it to do. The only reason I am switching to another Samsung is the size of the screen. It is just a little bigger than the S5. If this phone had not come out, I would still be with the S5."
yes,no,yes,Have dropped several times and my youngest son isn't the nicest when he plays and not one Crack or dent
yes,yes,yes,I fell in love with Samsung galaxy and have never looked back. I'd recommend it to the world if the company has not done so already.

I have to keep pressing the back button to get to the home page."
yes,yes,yes,Does samsung look 5s combines both a unique design with high quality based performance functionality. I have I am use many phones in my life and the galaxy has no problem stomping out the competition.

no,no,yes,"I bought this phone from ATT. It is Blue. When I try to register it, there is no Blue color listed. It will not let me register it. Funny Samsung don't know they make it in Blue."

yes,yes,yes,This galaxy s5 is attractive because the super amoled display is very colorful and looks alive. The back facing camera is very hi-def and takes breath taking pictures. This phone also offers blazing speeds and snappy responses. This phone is also water resistant and its just a great feature to have.
yes,yes,yes,"This is my very first Smart Phone... The other phones I have had were just a cell phone, then I moved up and got one that could do some online stuff, I called it my ""semi smart"" phone... When I saw my sister with the Samsung Galaxy S5 phone I knew I had to have it..."
yes,yes,yes,I was a little worried about whether I would like the Samsung Galaxy S5 because of all the iPhone 6 hype. I am so glad I made this purchase and look forward to enjoying the phone in the years to come. I enjoy the functionality and easy application.My favorite feature is my music. Thank you Samsung!
yes,yes,yes,This product is easy to use and has great features

yes,yes,yes,Samsung is and will only be my favorite device brand.
yes,yes,yes,"AMAZINGLY EASY-TO-USE, SEVERAL CUSTOMIZABLE LAYOUT OPTIONS. OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, Plus you get great access to the Galaxy Apps, which you can also customize to any of the several tab pages!?"
yes,yes,yes,I think this is a very good phone. Way better than the last phone I had. It's way faster & more reliable & doesn't crash @ all. Anyone should get this phone
yes,yes,yes,"First Android, always had an iPhone. I'm now s can of droid. My only complaint is the two levels of volume. It's a pain to not be able to raise volume all the way in first push. Other than that. I love it."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone I've owned. I started using Samsung phones/tablets a little over a year ago and they've managed to keep my business since, and I have no plans on changing that."
yes,yes,yes,Very Nice Phone alot of great features.I really like the finger print unlock missed this on my S4 that I upgraded from and from an Iphone 6 plus before.Decent battery life and great feel.

yes,yes,yes,"I've been a galaxy fan since the s3, and honestly the s5 is amazing and has surpassed all m6 expectations."
yes,yes,yes,The phone is great. I switched from an iphone and I like the ability to customize with widgets. The camera is great and the phone has a lot of cool features. However there are a few of things I'm a little disappointed about.The first and the biggest is you can't assign a specific vibration to a...
yes,yes,yes,"I really enjoy having the S5, the phones design is very nice easy to hold. I enjoy the features that come with the phone and the options for settings. The only thing I have noticed about mine is sometimes the phone can be a bit laggy, this could just be my phone though."
yes,yes,yes,"I love everything about this phone. Speed clarity, quality, features, ease of use. My only issue is with Samsung itself. I had the Galaxy S5 before upgrading and I had so many pop ups that started after the latest update, I've had the Note 5 for 3 weeks and the stupid pop ups started again."
yes,yes,yes,I would always be in the Samsung family forever!!!
yes,no,yes,I love the camera how clear it is! A big win on the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"The camera on this phone will give you nice and clear photos. The picture quality is just great.. Google maps is awesome and, web surfing is lightning fast!"
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy 5S is quite the phone! I had been a Samsung user before and switched to the iphone when the 4S came out. From day one I missed my Galaxy! I find that the Galaxy is much more user friendly and has many, many more apps available."
no,yes,yes,It's a good phone. Just freezes up sometimes. Had to reset my wallpaper a few times because of glitches.
yes,yes,yes,This is a phone with lots of features and very easy to use.
no,no,yes,"I will start with what I dislike first. I do a lot of surveys for companies and products. The address auto fill only works half the time. When it does not work and I have to type in my own email , it always gives me an error saying my email is invalid."
yes,yes,yes,Phone gets hot and screen doesn't shut off. Seems a little complicated to program once you get it. Picture are good quality but needs to be a bit faster.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is very light weight, holding it in one hand is comfortable; the camera Is amazing! The battery lasts me a day and a half. I do gotta say it's better than the iPhone's and I had a iPhone for five years. I'm loving it! Plus I can take the back part out to switch out the battery."
yes,yes,yes,Everything is so easy to use and understand. I love the options and how simple this phone is. It has everything you need and more. Love love my Samsung.
no,yes,no,"This phone (Samsung galaxy s5) is absolute junk. I am on my third one in a year because of technical issues this thing has had. First it just wouldn't work, would constantly shut down, the keyboard would randomly stop working, multiple issues."
yes,yes,yes,Buy this phone literally the best fam. Everyon has one and its better and cheaper than the 6 so I mean.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is blazing fast compared to my old S3. I wish I could have afforded to buy it sooner or buy a S6 now. The added battery capacity is awesome. I can't believe that there isn't a Micro SD slot. Clouds are nice but hardware is better.
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely love this phone! Its sleek, lightweight, and the touch screen is just the right size. Has a ton of wonderful apps and features all which are very easy to use. Everything is fast and convienant! Takes wonderful pictures. So happy I chose this phone!!!"

yes,yes,yes,Have been an (OTHER) user for years. Recently my phone had an accident and had to use my insurance to get a new phone. When the Samsung s5 came up as my trade option I was hesitant.like I said always had been a (OTHER)user and loved them.
yes,yes,yes,I bought my new Samsung about a month ago and I have hardly put it down ever since!!! I never knew there was SO much to check out on this phone. I have enjoyed so far and will continue to I'm sure. Thanks for a great product as usual Samsung!!!
no,yes,no,This phone is good but it occasionally crashes and I have to turn it on and off. In the future I would get 32 gigs because 16 isn't enough. When I want to do something it would say insufficient space on device
yes,yes,yes,Always was an non android user Got 2 Galaxy S5.....love them!!!!! Then also added the Note 4 to my collection and love it too!!! Convinced my sister (an avid non android user) to switch and her and my bro in law now have the 6 edge!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has excellent features such as water resistance, amazing graphics and color, fingerprint scanning, and it is really easy to use once you get used to it. The only thing is that the fingerprint scanner requires you to swipe your finger which is a bit annoying."
no,no,yes,Feature that is available on Galaxy S4 (Alarm Voice Control) is no longer available on S5
yes,yes,yes,"I have to admit, this is my first smartphone, and I am happy that I chose the Galaxy S5. It's very easy to use, The screen size is a plus, and without the bulk, like some others. The sound is also great. No complaints yet!"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has been wonderful, like everything about it nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
yes,yes,yes,I am very happy with the galaxy line. I don't however like that owning a micro-sd card is pretty much pointless.
yes,yes,yes,"It has great features, takes awesome pictures, and I love that you can add memory. It also charges quickly and I can use it for two days without having to charge it."
yes,yes,yes,"I am so happy with this phone. It has all the features I could want, a great camera and zoom, the speakers are loud and amplified and the best thing of all is that it is water resistant which for us mom's translates to baby drool proof (:"
yes,yes,yes,I have always owned iphones until this August. My husband and I decided to try our new Samsung phones. We chose our Galaxy s5 because of the value and ease of system apps we had seen on our friends' phones.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought the Galaxy S5 to use on a ""bring your own phone"" service plan. Set up on the plan went very smoothly. The phone itself is a pleasure to use. Very simple to learn. It's a speedy little demon, too. Just love it."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone has an easy to use mode which is perfect for me because I am not tech savvy. Still getting use to it but overall a good phone. Has a camera, alot of apps (which i don't like), the phone works (my iphone wasn't working), and texting."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. We upgraded from the S3, and my favorite app is Milk music."
yes,yes,yes,Have really enjoyed my S5 since the day I purchased it! Pleased with everything... No Complaints!!!

yes,yes,yes,Great product love it so much been a Samsung user for a long time
yes,yes,yes,I love my Galaxy S5. I love that I can see the screen clearly even if I am out side. It is easy to use. I like that the battery lasts a long time. It also recharges quickly.
yes,yes,yes,This product has one of the best camera in the market. The only problem with the camera is in lowlight for some reason the pictures in lowlights don't look that good. Overall the camera is great I'll give it a 9.5.
yes,yes,yes,I would recommend this product to all my friends and family members
yes,yes,yes,Updated from a galaxy s3 to a galaxy s5 and couldnt be happier.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone. I switched from iPhone to galaxy and I love it. It is great quality and functions great. I've never had any issues with it. It's thin and has a big screen, even in my back pocket it doesn't bend or catch fire. (Lol) the privacy mode is a bonus!!"
yes,yes,yes,I received this phone as a gift and it was the best gift I've ever received. I would recommend it to anyone. Love the kids mode app and the security app (lookout)
yes,yes,yes,Was skeptical about changing over from iPhone too Android but had a trial period and ready like it! I work in I.T.and enjoy a little more of a challenge. But really like some of the features and apps offered. Most of my stuff I found have transferred over as as well. You know the saying.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is a really good design, i like the ability to put in an SD card and change the battery. I also like the slim design that is also water resistant with out the phone being big and bulky."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new s5 itsperfect
no,yes,yes,I was guite happy with my phone till it started overheating and now it echos when I'm on the phone.
yes,no,yes,I like the samsung galexy s5 for one because of the built in finger print scanner that is a great way to secure your phone with peace of mind that no body else can mess with it. As well as the bright vivid screen. Everything looks sharp and clear.
yes,yes,yes,"Unless some features I missed from the S5 (sd card, water proof) the Note 5 is faster. Screen size meets my needs and the pen is becoming my best friend. No lags so far with my normal load (open apps around 7). The quality of the calls (carrier + device) is amazing clear when using LTE."
yes,no,yes,I had this since its release and love it I had no problems with it except battery over heating witch I fixed by getting a new battery.
yes,yes,yes,I love my s5. Its very easy to use. The camera is awesome. I love it.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has the best camera and lots of cool settings to switch to. Definitely love this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Pros-1. Beautiful display.Cons-1. The interface still feels cluttered.
yes,yes,yes,This is my third Samsung phone. I am an avid consumer with them. Samsung is for self-thinkers that appreciate the care and concern for the consumer in the design & manufacturing of the product.
yes,yes,yes,I originaly had the Samsung S2 and loved it. But after it had a few falls i had to replace it. So i decided to get the Samsung S5. I love it its functions are simular but there are so many extra features that are easy to use.
yes,no,yes,I don't know how to do a lot of the functions but there is so much going on. It plays music well too
yes,yes,yes,This is a really good phone. The more I get used to how it operates the more I like it.
yes,no,yes,Voice Search really outperforms the competition. The voice recognition is superior with flawless intrrpretition.
yes,yes,yes,This product has great font features and i love the filter option when taking pics. Its great for me to use with work and school!! I love Samsung!!
no,no,yes,"I had the LG3 before the Galaxy 5, was slow compared to the G5 took forever to come on and load up , sent it back 4x for the mic not working and still couldn't get a different phone so I bought the G5 out right and love it"
yes,yes,yes,The keyboard and app interface could have better functionationality but overall it is an amazing device.
yes,yes,yes,"I currently own several Samsung devices, a galaxy s5, a galaxy tab style and a chrome book 2. I also have a Samsung TV and a few other household appliances. These have all been great products. Easy to use. Full of great features. Very durable. And they all look great too."
yes,no,yes,"I am very glad that I bought this phone, this phone is excellent in its performance, just perfect display and phone size."
yes,yes,yes,"This product has great features because I can multitask. I can be in a call and be sending an email, or be on social media and be checking my email. I like the features because it gives me more liberty and flexibility to do more than one thing at a time."
yes,yes,yes,purchased this phone after owning the galaxy s3 for years. great upgrade. the phones performance was excellent for my needs. i did not like the speaker at the bottom . camera is great.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, its amazing with a great running percentage and all apps run great!"
yes,yes,yes,I have owned an s3 and an s4. Samsung is my favorite brand of electronics. They are easy to use and in my opinion the most durable.
yes,yes,yes,I love the new Samsung S5. My only complaint is with the automatic downloading of apps that I really don't want on my phone and the inability to uninstall those apps. As the owner of the phone the choice of what apps I want and don't want should be up to me and not Samsung.
no,yes,no,I cannot get the 4G to go off when I only need WIFI. I am at home most of the time and the 4G keeps popping up. What can I do to stop it?
yes,yes,yes,"If you are looking for an android with a great durable screen, snappy processor, and reliable battery then this phone will not let you down. I would recommend this phone to anyone who enjoys an android experience with some Samsung perks."
yes,yes,yes,I have really enjoyed this phone. I upgraded from an S4 when the screen died and the bigger brighter display is great!
yes,yes,yes,The thing I always like in Samsung Galaxy is the way you take pictures and it looks always perfect
yes,yes,yes,I have this phone and my dad has the iphone 6. It's a great phone but I like the design of the iphone better than this one. Otherwise it's great.
yes,yes,yes,This smart phone does all it is supposed to very functionally. Slim and easy to use. Decent battery life.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung galaxy 5. I'm 68 years young and had no trouble adapting to this phone. It has great features, the photos are so clear. I love the louder ring. I would recommend this phone to everyone."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the ease of browsing the web with the phone. I love the photo app and the contact/phone apps. these are essentially why I have the phone, anyway (for business). However, I am having trouble accessing various things, such as ""play books."
yes,yes,yes,Not a bad phone. Good for college students. Nice display and fast processor.
no,yes,yes,"These phones can be completely customized, from individual volume levels, to ringtones, to widgets. It takes some time to figure it all out, but it's worth the work."
yes,yes,yes,I switched to this phone from a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 which I love also. This phone has so many cool features one of my favorites being the fingerprint swipe to open your phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I had my phone for about a couple of years and I love samsung products. I also recently just purchased a samsung edge 6 which is a beautiful phone. Got it on gold, very sleek and the features are wonderful. The pictures and the videos and really nice quality☺."
yes,yes,yes,I was switching from an older phone of a different brand. I was unsure about the decision but have been pleasantly surprised at the ease of use and features.

yes,yes,yes,"This is one of the best products I have ever used. Fast, reliable, and easy to use"
yes,yes,yes,"Easy to use, GREAT screen and resolution. Picture taking is easy."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first ""smart phone"" and it was rather daunting getting it set up to suit me. I do have an android tablet, that helped somewhat. I have now had the phone about 3 weeks, and am still learning. A better instruction manual would have speeded up the process, especially for a first time user."
yes,yes,yes,I bought my son and myself a samsung galaxy s5 and we love them.
yes,yes,yes,"Battery life is great, Phone is very durable, Charging port is backward compatible, Interface is easily navigable with enough room for both widgets and app shortcuts. Only real issue is completely closing applications/internet is a bit confusing."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely luv my s5. Every single thing about it makes me smile. It has the most beautiful color. It's extremely fast. The camera is outta this world. I have all Samsung products my ultra high Def t.v is samsung. My 4k blue ray player is Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,This is by far the best phone I've had. I've recently went from the s3 and it's is wayyyyy better. The galaxy just has to reposition the speakers.
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung has always been reliable and dependable! Love the great design and how it fits in my hand, purse, or pocket. There are so many great features to choose from. Love my Samsung phone!"
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. Is very fast ! I like the app for fingerprints.
yes,yes,yes,When using the product the fast and easy navigation. Helps when you need something and quick.
no,no,no,My phone is always lagging super slow... even with no applications running. And the camera is Horribly slow.
yes,yes,yes,I have a lot of cell phones on my 32 years on planet earth but I have never had any with everything I need in one phone the s5 is all thatand more.
no,yes,yes,The main issue is that when I plug in auxiliary cable to vehicle it doesn't register anything & just plays thru phone. Only registers if actual earphones of some sort are plugged in.
yes,yes,yes,Good reliable phone. Fast and has great features to it.
yes,no,yes,"It's super easy to work with, especially since we have the ability to work with the S5 even with gloves on. Using Iphones, it's really hard to get it to respond while wearing a glove, however the S5 allows us to do just that."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung S5 is proving to be a solid phone, with nice display."
yes,yes,yes,Really like the s5. Fits my life style and my needs prefect.
yes,yes,yes,It is amazing. has everything I need and want! :) really happy with it.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone just did not live up to expectations. I like the fingerprint scanner and the heart rate monitor are a plus. The phone has improved since it first came out, but it just failed to be impressive. The phone is a little sluggish and the more you use it, the slower it goes."
yes,yes,yes,This phone has many great features and is well worth the money. Way better than iPhones!
yes,yes,yes,"I have had flip phones for years, this is my first smart phone and I am loving it. The features and possibilities are endless. I am learning more and more about its capabilities and it is helping me prepare to be up-to-date with technology and communicating with other people as I begin to prepare to..."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a really good phone, has good camera quality, the speed of the phone is good, the amount of space on the phone is just wonderful. I love the way it feels in my hand perfectly. The way the phone is structured, it's most likely not to fall out of my hand."
yes,yes,yes,This is a very good and fast phone! The battery does tend to die pretty quickly.
yes,yes,yes,Best decision ever! I have been using a windows phone for at least the past six years. Decided that it was time for a change and upgraded to the Samsung Galaxy S5 Android and have not looked back.
no,yes,no,I received this phone after my Samsung Galaxy s3 stopped charging.
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned about 6 different Android phones in the last 7 years, and this phone is easily the best one.The power this phone has is incredible. So far nothing hangs it up. The screen is clear and crisp. The radio for AT&T is fast. Being able to add a micro SD card to expand memory is another plus."
yes,yes,yes,The s5 was the best phone purchase I could have made. It does everything I need it to do and then some.I would definitely recommend this device to everyone.
yes,yes,yes,I was waiting to see if there was going to be a better product than the Samsung Galaxy S5. I waited two years and I found the S5 had the features I needed. It comes pre-loaded with so many apps. You have to decide the ones that best suits you.
yes,yes,yes,"It's great. Much better than my last phone. There have been a few bumps but nothing too major. Sometimes alarms don't sound, texts used to arrive in this odd order and I can't customize my call log but I'm overall passed with my device."
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone but I don't see a big difference from the galaxy s4 besides that it takes better pictures
no,no,no,"The only bad thing I've noticed is that when putting a call on speakerphone, if it's at the highest volume, or with the extra volume on, the sound cracks. My S4 never did this and this is very annoying becasue I use speakerphone a lot."
yes,yes,yes,I love my galaxy s5. It is everything I was looking for in a phone and love the features.
yes,yes,yes,"I have never had a Samsung of any sort and I was thinking that it was going to be kind of hard to get used to using it, but it was really really simple to use. Since I have had it I have had no problems with it. I have already recommended this to all my family and friends."
yes,yes,yes,The phone takes the best pictures then any other phone hands down! Easy to use!
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first android phone after Blackberries and one iPhone. Best decision I ever made as the functions in the phone as delivered are very useful, and the speed of the phone's processor is as quick as I have had."
yes,yes,yes,"I love how it fits in one hand. So easy to use, whether I need to listen to music or snap a few photos. My screen and graphics are very clear and the feature are amazing. I love my Samsung. I'm an Android baby lol."
yes,yes,yes,"I love it! I have not figured it all out yet but I am getting there. The camera is really great , clear picture. I like the larger screen. Easy to hold and fit into pockets."
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone but I really miss my note 4 so this review is a bit biased. I traded my note 4 when I switched carriers and received the S5. The phone is packed with features and can handle most things you throw at it.
yes,yes,yes,"I really like this phone. My first phone I actually ever got by myself. I like the features on the phone, such as the heartbeat sensor and even the fingerprint scanner. It really is amazing, the design of the phone is sleek. It can fit in tight spaces because it is rather thin."
yes,yes,yes,I am completely in love with the camera on this phone.
yes,yes,yes,This phone was easy to use and set up I really enjoyed it
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! And its features!! Tones could be a little louder but over all good
yes,yes,yes,"It's good phone, I most like is big screen and camera."

yes,yes,no,The phone is 7 weeks old & I have to do a factory reset. I had 10/20 3rd party apps installed in the phone. My wife has 30 more apps (including all the apps installed) in her Galaxy S4.
no,no,no,This has to be the absolute worst phone I have ever owned. The amount of glitches is ridiculous. I am a constant texter and this phone simply cannot keep up. It will send my texts two to four times which is extremely annoying to the person that I am texting.
yes,yes,yes,For the first time ever I was disappointed in a Samsung product.
yes,yes,yes,Received the Galaxy S5 because Samsung couldn't fix my ten day old Note 3. It's smaller but overall a pretty suitable replacement. The power cord attachment at the base of the phone is a nightmare.
yes,yes,yes,"I just bought my Tab S and so far I love it. I have a samsung S5 phone and love the app, side sync . As I use my Tablet more I will learn all the amazing things it can do. Bright screen, beautiful resolution of pictures, etc."
yes,yes,yes,Its a great products with all the features I need.
yes,no,yes,"Samsung's Galaxy S5 excels at everything that matters -- Android 4.4 KitKat OS; a bright, beautiful display; blistering quad-core processor; and an excellent camera experience."
yes,yes,yes,Pretty average phone loved it since I switched from the iPhone 4s seeing there's more u can do but I believe android in general has work to do or maybe that's what the lollipop update was but I couldn't tell u since for some reason the newest phones can't even get the latest updates smh
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung has the best technology, the best look and the best support for its users."
yes,no,yes,"The heart rate monitor can be better, finger print scanner not up to expectations yet."
yes,yes,yes,I will never stop buying Samsung products because they are the best bar none. I have had 4 smartphones in my life and 3 have been made by Samsung and I have yet to be let down by the quality of their products. I ordered my S5 last week and it just got here last night and I have yet to put it down...
yes,yes,yes,"i love my Samsung. of all the phones I have had, this one by far is the best."

yes,yes,yes,I just love this phone!! I think it's better than the I - phone! ! I can put it in my pocket & it won't bend!!
no,yes,yes,Cons: The Calander on the S5 does not have a task/to do category nor does it have an option to preview said tasks/to do lists for one day at a time. The left touch screen button pulls up the last items that you have had opened up on your phone instead of pulling up the settings for whatever site or...
no,no,yes,I love my galaxy s5.. It got ran over 5 times the front screen was shattered it wouldnt come on right away. But when my son came down to visit he plugged it in to see if it would work and the lights came on.. We took to repair shop they replaced the front screen and LCD..
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone!!! I would buy it again if I needed to.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been a fan of samsung for a long time now all starting with the Samsung fascinate s1. Few years later I upgrade to the s3 and I was loving it. Now I see that the s5 is out and I upgrade, expecting that this phone will be the perfect phone for me. Boy was I wrong."
yes,yes,yes,"I had the Samsung S3 but had problems with it, so went back to the iphone 4 and then upgraded to the iphone 5, although improvements have been made with the iphone, i missed the galaxy due to the ability to personalize it and do more with it."
yes,yes,yes,"I just upgraded from the galaxy sIII to the s5 and what a difference. Faster, brighter, better screen resolution, sleek design. I could on and on, you just have to see and use it to believe it."
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy my phone. It takes great pictures and has great functions. I really enjoy the preloaded apps especially the s-health.
yes,yes,yes,do not get a cheap case like SPECK because its not safe for your phone.. Because I did and now I'm paying the price for another phone because it hit the corner of the case and cracked the screen and lucky I have ins. on my galaxy S 5 phone.
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy s5 it is a wonderfully functioning phone with advanced settings and options which make it all the more fun to use.
yes,yes,yes,"i must say that when i opened this thing from the box, i was in love, it was beautiful and durable yet easy to use. however because i accidentally dented the rim, does that make it not waterproof, or is it still ok to use?"
yes,yes,yes,Very user-friendly! I love everything about my new Samsung S5! I'm a happy user!
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone, easy to use, has some good features. Love the transfer feature from phone to phone. Takes really good photos. Good music features. Works well with mydlink lite. Nice that it's dust proof and semi water proof. Like the Samsung gear and Samsung s note. I have other Samsung products."
yes,yes,yes,I loved my S4 and this was the perfect upgrade for me. The camera isn't as top of the line as I expected but an all around fabulous smart phone.
yes,yes,yes,just got my new S5 and so far its amazing. I didnt think that the newer galaxys were much better than my S3 but man was I wrong. The S5 is way more powerful and faster at everything when compared to my S3. I should have upgraded a long time ago. Loving my S5 go Samsung
no,yes,yes,I stood in line for over three hours to get the Galaxy S5 and I'd do it again!The iPhone is gone forever!
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love this phone. My only problem is that the email on it is very difficult for me. I am signed on to my google email in the provided email app that comes with the phone. For some reason when I delete any emails and then refresh my inbox, the emails re-appear."
yes,no,yes,I have been anti apple my whole life and I finally bought the Samsung galaxy as my first samsung phone and I have yet to regret it! I am constantly bragging to all of my iphone friends about the great features it has.
yes,yes,yes,This is by far the best Android device I have owned. The screen is bright and clear. I thought the size my be an issue but reading text on it is awesome.
yes,yes,yes,My first smart phone. I enjoy using this phone and like most of the features. I don't like that apps that I will never use download themselves. I am gentle on phones and have never had to have one fixed. I can not afford to run out to get a new one when the next big thing hits the market.
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone. Been using it for over a week now. No flaws that I can see in the operating system. The only thing is when I turn on power saving mode the performance drastically reduces other than that a really solid phone overall.
yes,yes,yes,I like the way the phone works and that there are apps for anything you can think of. I also like that the battery life is great.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung again lives up to its reputation for delivering yet another high quality phone. Speed and reliability along with other features are great. I have still yet to learn about even more features to make this phone even more productive. Looking forward the the next.
yes,yes,yes,I have had an Iphone since i can remember like when they came out with the Iphone 3. All my friends had a Samsung phone and could not be happier with it. So i switched. I could honestly not be happier with my choice. I love the way it feels in my hand.
no,no,no,"I purchased the Galaxy 5S 3 or 4 months ago and my phone stopped working out of the blue due to no fault of my own (phone hasn't been dropped and never been in water#. I could use the phone on Wi-Fi but not make or receive calls and texts. I called AT&T, they recommended a new SIM card."
yes,yes,yes,Heart rate features keeping track of your food intake. Plus setting up your phone so you can't text while driving is a great and different feature. I like how my work calendar sync with my calendar on the phone so I can stay organized. I love Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung S5 is THE BEST! I've always had phones which had 'issues'. But this one is super perfect! I love, love, love the Samsung S5!!!! And you can't beat the value! It is well worth the price!!"
yes,yes,yes,Samsung decided to let Google take over all the apps. Google decided in August not to allow syncing with Outlook calendars. I can see the Outlook calendar but cannot enter anything into it. Android phones should not be taken over by Google.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great but for some reason the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 is more to my taste
yes,yes,yes,"This product is great , I would recommend it to anyone , it has amazing features . I was a little lenient on buying it at first because I've always been a iphone user but it was worth my purchase and I'm so glad I chose to switch !"

yes,yes,yes,the galaxy 5s is my first foray into smartphones and so far I've been very pleased with its performance. its very fast 99% of the time and the other 1% i'm not sure what happens but its not common and it doesn't last long so it hasn't been a bother to me.
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy S5 is fantastic! Love this phone! Color is amazing, very easy to use"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is amazing with capabilities that cannot be found on apple products, my favorite thing about it is the fact that I can put an sd card in it for more space, when I had an iPhone the a amount of times I ran out of space and couldn't download a needed update was ridiculous."
yes,yes,yes,"Where to begin ... I was a former iPhone user and thought I would never try another phone model ... enter the Galaxy S3 ... and that changed everything ... From the S3 to the S4 and now to the S5, the Galaxy S Line of Smartphones is by far, without a doubt, hands down, the absolute best phones..."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the features to this phone, especially the camera. I thought this phone might be hard to get used to after having an Iphone, but it was really a lot easier."
yes,yes,yes,"When I need my email the most i can depend on my Galaxy S5 to work on demand. Applications I use for my work place have to be accessible on the spot, and they are, every time. Fits good in my hand with weight distribution in the right areas. Just a great device."
yes,yes,yes,"The product has incredible features, especially the camera! I'm in love with the clarity of my pictures. Also in love with the screen and the battery life. It does run slow and get frustrating every now and then, but it's overall the best phone I've ever had."
yes,no,yes,Everything response real fast when you either open an app or tell s voice to do something I use s voice all the time and it always has an answer. I love some of the answers it gives when you ask s voice certain questions. Its almost a game in its own.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new Galaxy S5, love everything about it. Would buy another one."

yes,no,yes,"I have to admit this phone is tough and durable, I have a problem with dropping my phones and I have dropped this one I would say about 20 times to say the least, well unfortunatly it finally did shatter the screen but it still works thankfully, I guess I will have to get it fixed now,"

yes,yes,yes,Couldn't be more satisfied. I'm glad I stayed with Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,"Have had this phone for several weeks now and am very pleased with it. I've had a Galaxy Tab-3 for about a year and the Galaxy S-5 is almost identical, except for the size.The phone was very easy to set up and begin using. All my apps were restored automatically."
yes,yes,yes,Love not only the way it looks but internet is fast and it has a lot of nice features. And it connects to wifi way better. Also the perfect size. Nothing bad to say.
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone I have ever had. I switched from the iPhone 4 which I pretty much hated from day 1. I endured 2 years with it and now, I feel so liberated.

yes,yes,yes,Has great picture quality and it just needs some fine tuning.

yes,yes,yes,"about yet another step up for me, from the Galaxy S2 to the S3, to the S4 and now the S5 and each time the excitement grows because each phone gets better!While many features strongly resemble the S4, features like fingerprint recognition, health monitoring and many other upgrades, both subtle and..."

yes,yes,yes,Been a part of the galaxy brand from the start. Love samsung electronics.
yes,yes,yes,"Samsungs online registration page does more to discourage future puchasing of Samsung products than the products themselves. Product registration is a fundamental part of product selection, but I may never purchase Samsung products again if I continue to have such negative results as I have had..."
yes,yes,yes,"I had been a iPhone user since day one and update every time they come out with a new one. I gave up my iPhone 5S for a Galaxy S5 and loving it and purchases one for my wife. We both shared calendar, contract, memo and each have a different email addresses."
no,no,no,"I have already had to replace the S5 and the replacement is having problems. I must turn my mobile data on when I want to access the internet and immediately turn it off. Otherwise it is sucking my data. I normally use between 2-6 gigs of data a month. Last month 11 gigs, this month over 21 gigs."
yes,yes,yes,"There are so many great features with this phone, but who would ever have time or a need to use them all? It would be great for a business person who works 24/7. Warning! It will use your data very quickly if you do not turn it off."

yes,yes,yes,"I think the camera is amazing, It takes beautiful pictures clear, sharp"

yes,yes,yes,"Love my Galaxy S 5!!! Simple to learn how to use but has everything on it I need!! I own my own essential oil business, co-own a tanning salon with my fiance, plus manage my fiance's plumbing business, so saying I need a smart phone with access to everything in an understatement!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"It's refreshing to find a product that has great features at the right price point... without feeling like all of my devices need to be from the same company or running the same software. Our home has 3 PCs, 2 tablets, 2 cell phones, and multiple set top boxes."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had all the Galaxy phones...mesmerize, galaxy s2, s3, s4, note2, and now the galaxy s5...out of all of them, the s5 has proved to be the best!! Great battery life, not overloaded with preloaded apps, and clear, brilliant display. DEFINITLEY RECOMMEND!"
yes,yes,yes,"I have been using the iphone for 5 years and I got a new one each year. October 2013 when the Galaxy Note 3 came out, so I thought I make a switch and give it a try. I love it, and the Galaxy S5 came out so I upgraded and now I won't see myself going back to the iphone."
yes,yes,yes,I love the camera. I have a iphone 4s before the galaxy S5 and I compare...obviously the galaxy camera is better than iphone a hundred porcent.
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone I've ever had. It's light. You can adjust color, contrast., and font to make it easier for old eyes with rotten vision. I really like the pedometer too. I use it every day. Calls are clear. The big screen is great for games and video calls."
yes,yes,yes,I would lost with out my galaxy s5. There are so many features that you wouldn't even expect in a phone. The s voice has came along way! I have had all the galaxy up to this one . Samsung nailed it this time. It's so much more than phone.
yes,yes,yes,It's an awesome phone. I have all 5 of the galaxy's and this one by far is the best!!!!
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! Was easy to switch from my old phone and still keep all my stuff. Love having a waterproof phone without having to pay extra for a case. Would definitely recommend to friends and already have! Was also cheaper than the other smartphones that also recently come out.
yes,yes,yes,The only t thing I don't l like is the size it has excellent battery life
yes,yes,yes,I am a previous note 2 and GS4 owner. The GS5 is amazing. Love it and all the features. Now I'm ready for the Note Edge to be released so I can get it. I am a Samsung customer for life.
yes,yes,yes,While this phone has many great features - including a camera that is second to none - the best thing I like about this phone is that I don't have to charge it during the day to make it through.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been ""Pro iphone"" for years, I've had every model since the original but when I saw the camera quality on the Samsung Galaxy 5 I was immediately sold. When I got it and have seen ALL the features it has I know my money was well spent. I have recommended this phone to all of my friends."
no,yes,no,On my third S5 but I won't give up...having minor issues with the phone coming out of sleep mode after I have locked it. I also hate that I can't turn off the red eye flash when taking pictures.
yes,yes,yes,I love almost everything about this phone. The only thing that needs improvement is the speakers. When talking to someone at times they can't hear or understand you very well. Also when switching to speaker during a call it is not as clear or loud as my S3 was.
yes,yes,yes,"After having a iPhone for so long I was afraid to switch. After working out the issue with all my imessages going to the cloud, I must say I love my galaxy s5."
no,yes,no,At first I loved it..... the clarity and vibrance and how quickly it functioned. Then after only a couple of months of having it the charging cover came off after I was disconnecting it from the charger. I took it to where I purchased it and they told me I had to call Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has great features and so many apps to enhance your experience. I've had my phone over a month and still finding great features, I absolutely love my galaxy 5."

yes,yes,yes,"My family is a Galaxy family! My son has the Galaxy S3, my fiance has the Galaxy S4 and I have the Galaxy S5! We absolutely love these phones and think that anyone who goes with any iPhone is completely, 100% , missing out! I am just missing the Samsung Tablet!"
yes,yes,yes,"I've had a few other brands, but I love Samsung products of all types especially the S5. Very fast, great screen, great camera and beats the other front runner on the market hands down! Best smart phone on the market today."
yes,yes,yes,"My gs5 is the best phone I've ever owned. It is waterproof to the point I felt comfortable taking it into the pool to take candid shots of my kids swimming. I conduct all my business on my phone too. It is not always convenient to take out my laptop, but with this phone I don't have to."
yes,yes,yes,I like the s5 and think it is a fantastic phone and it is practically near perfect. Samsung has accounted for everything in a phone user's daily life.
yes,yes,yes,It has come a long way from the flip phones!
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I have ever had. I had an iPhone before I got this phone. Samsung 5 has great features and a lot better than the iPhone 5

yes,yes,yes,I love the phone I just wish it had the briefing option for the alarm clock.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. Water proof, tv remote which works on older TVs as well. Very fast processor. I have nothing to say bad about this phone."

yes,yes,yes,"Great phone easy to use, great features, camera is awesome."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a high quality phone. It has a great camera, a nice screen size, and a fast processor."
yes,yes,yes,I switched to the Galaxy S5 from my Iphone 4 and I couldn't be happier. It runs faster and the battery life is amazing. I only wish that the colors of the menus were more cutomizable.
yes,no,yes,really like the phone only downfall is that the battery life is short
yes,yes,yes,"Chances are, you'll be happy with the Galaxy S5 if you choose to buy it. It's a solid upgrade to the Galaxy S4, with reasonable improvements to the design, software and camera. I can't say this is your most visually appealing option, especially compared to the all-metal HTC One M8, but the dimpled..."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome! I converted to a Galaxy S5 from an iPhone and the battery life just amazes me. When I had my iPhone I had to charge me phone 1-2 times everyday...sometimes more, but with the Galaxy S5 a full charge lasts me 2 days. I have no complaints!"
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about my phone it has everything I want on it
yes,yes,yes,I took video with my s5 sy Niagara Falls and it got soaked. I wasn't worried because it's waterproof. Amazing feature. I love my new phone. It's user friendly as well.
yes,yes,yes,One thing I am always on the look out for is a good battery life; the S5 has that along with many other features that are just a must with phones today. The feature that tipped me over the buying edge was the word waterproof.

yes,no,yes,"I'm a new convert to Samsung Galaxy S5 from the iPhone 5, after using generations of iPhone. I'm so glad I did it. The Galaxy does everything for me that I wish my iPhone could have done. Plus it's got a WAY bigger screen."

Most of the apps that I've downloaded take a second or less. Great for streaming videos. I haven't had any lag at all.
yes,yes,yes,"The new Galaxy S5 is pretty sweet. The speed is pretty good, but not as fast as the Note 3. The built in heart rate sensor needs some work. That is one feature that could be better."
yes,yes,yes,Do not like the open market on apps. Privacy like iPhone provides is a top notch service. No reason for any one to have access to my data etc if it's not necessary to run the application. I don't like that the phone can have this game running on it that I didn't open in the 1st place.

yes,yes,yes,"So I like the speed of the Galaxy s5, but the design is not "" fancy"" enough. If it was maybe slimmer like the s4, but with a more metallic feel and look to it. I think that alone would make the phone more balanced. The inside would fit the outside. The amount of space could also be worked on."
no,no,no,"NotRecommended,waste of money until issues resolve"
yes,yes,yes,I love my Galaxy S5. It does more than I could imagine
yes,yes,yes,This product has some awesome features. I have no regrets in making a change from another product I had utilized for many years.

yes,yes,yes,I thought long and hard before giving up my beloved iPhone. It wasn't an easy decision ... but I was seduced by the S5 ' s display. Samsung apps helped tremendously with the transition and now I can't believe I even hesitated!My only real issue is the position of the microphone/speaker ...

yes,yes,yes,Checked out a lot of reviews on different phones before purchasing the Galaxy S5. The first night I had the phone I stayed up till 1am discovering what it could do....and I'm still discovering new things. As I recently started a walking and exercise program I love the health options.
yes,yes,yes,I really love the style of this phone. It's slim yet big enough to operate. I love many of the features. It does tend to get hot when multiple apps run. It's vibrant colors reminds me of how your SmartTVs show.
yes,yes,yes,"I was a bit nervous, but soon found this extremely easy to use. I love this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first smartphone, didnt want one but once i got this phone i love it"
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, battery life is excellent, Apps are awesome, the phone is easy to use and with the built in fingerprint scanner makes this a top choice. I would recommend this to anyone."

yes,yes,yes,"I am so happy with my S5. It has every app I ever could want, has a great camera, and a nice large keyboard for making phone calls. Texting is simple as can be, too!"

yes,yes,yes,"Most people say this phone is a disappointment from the S4, but it most definitely is not! I'm coming from a Galaxy S4 Active which is even more like the S5 with the water resistance, but it is such a step up in design and performance from the last generation!"
yes,yes,yes,I switch over from an IPhone to an android and I love it! I will not be going back to an iPhone. I have read some of the reviews where people said that they are having issues with the fingerprint scanner. I have not had any issues with that whatsoever.
yes,no,yes,"I am loving this Galaxy S 5. It does a lot of things that I have yet to explore. Picture quality is great. lot of additional apps included on your phone. Apps that can help you keep up your health, weather and a whole lot of other things."
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about this phone. EXCEPT the sound volume. I can barely hear it unless I'm right on top of it and if there are no other ambient sounds. I NEVER hear it ring when it is in my purse. All volume levels are up as high as they will go (15).
yes,yes,yes,Samsung outdoing themselves AGAIN!! Keep up the awesome work guys!!
yes,yes,yes,It took me three years to finally switch from my old phone to something new. I am so happy I chose the Samsung Galaxy S5.
no,no,yes,The S5 speaker quality is terrible! When the speaker is turned on the back of the phone has too much vibration. Voice quality is not that great.
yes,no,yes,Had a SIII and like it so went to S5 when time to renew contract.
yes,yes,yes,"At first didn't seem confident about this product, but after use it for a while, i can say this is the best phone i ever use. Except for the speaker, everything about this phone is very perfect"

yes,yes,yes,I'm so happy with my new galaxy 5 all the new options are great for me feels like they designed it just for me
yes,yes,yes,It is truly amazing as to how the team of Samsung has found a way to create a fully packaged phone !
yes,yes,yes,I've owned a couple of Galaxy phones. This is by far the best (GS5). I really like the ultra power saving mode. Built in task killer. All around awesome phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I fell in love with this phone from the first time I held it. I love the features and overall performance a little large from past phones, but other than that I would not trade it for the world."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! Has all I need to do what I need to get done!
yes,yes,yes,"I had to return my device twice for issues. It was a brand new phone and the insides had to be replaced each time. I really love this phone, I think it is great and has what I was looking for."
yes,yes,yes,"Switched over to galaxy from iPhone, it's amazing although it's slightly more complicated to figure out it is still a beautiful phone."
yes,yes,yes,Phone is just the right size for me. I can see things easier and still not too big for my pocket.
yes,yes,yes,"I never thought i would like a smartphone other than my i-Phone, but I do!"
yes,yes,yes,Very easy to operate and navigate. Camera takes awesome pictures.

yes,yes,yes,I went from being a tech afraid guy to I can't wait to pick up my S-5 and see what's next. Very cool. Let's see if it will stand up over the long haul.
yes,no,yes,"I am enjoying and getting use to my new phone, there is still lots to learn about the phone. The only down fall about this phone is that it needs charging more than my prior windows phone."
yes,yes,yes,"This beastly machine does everything you want! The battery lasts throughout the whole day, the ram gives it that little boost which makes it great for games and videos, and its camera is very handy for good quality shots! I just love it!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new Galaxy S5!!! The internet is super fast, the phone holds a charge for about two days, the only downfall I see is the fingerprint scanner is a little difficult to work. You have to have your thumb just right for it to recognize it's you."
yes,yes,yes,I had the Galaxy 3 and it was good. I had the Galaxy 4 and it was great. Now I have the 5 and WOW - I LOVE THIS THING. Samsung ROCKS!The only thing my 4 had that was slightly better was the speakers. They could be a little louder on the 5 - but still this phone is a super winner.
yes,yes,yes,I love my new s5. I have never had a galaxy phone before but I know and trust in the samsung brand and I wasn't disappointed with my latest purchase.
yes,yes,yes,I have been through a lot of phone's and this one is by far the best. I absolutely Love everything about it. I work outside in the elements all day everyday and it stands up to everything nature throws at it from rain to all kind of dust to direct sunlight and heat.
yes,yes,yes,The battery life is extremely awesome. And has a great camera.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been using my new S5 for a couple of weeks now. I am very pleased with its speed, the battery life and other things. The only thing I don't like is the lock screen. If you put in a password you can't slide the top to read your notifications. Very comparable to my last Motorola which I loved."
yes,yes,yes,"Everyday, I find something new to try and use. Really am enjoying it."
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned every galaxy phone at one point or another, and the s5 is a culmination of years of experience. This phone is the best galaxy yet! There are classic features, and a few new ones that are unique to smartphones. The main reason I purchased the s5 was the fact that it is water resistant."
yes,yes,yes,"Really like this phone. Had a S4 this one has a much faster processor, better camera and the one on the s4 was good. Love the features too of the S5. Great job Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,I just got my s5 and is amazing thanks samsung keep making device's like the galaxy s
yes,yes,yes,I fell in love with Samsung products after I had my Galaxy S3. I love how they operate and just the overall design. I will never go back to another kind of phone. I was so excited to get the S5 and it lived up to all the excitement.
yes,yes,yes,I like the change to the UI it looks so much better
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 offers any array of features to meet users leisure, entertainment, business, and social media needs.

yes,yes,yes,"Good design and features, especially for the camera. i like the messaging aspects. The games are awesome. it could be more easier to use in a way."
yes,yes,yes,"This product is beautiful! And, it has a great design and peforms quickly. I have encountered a few problems. First, the e-mail function - Galaxy S5 is not marking read emails. The gmail app works fine, this is a problem with the built in standard email app.If an unread message is received by the..."
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy S5 is miles better than my last phone. I love the long battery life and the easy to use features. There are some apps that I decided that I did not want so I deleted them with no problems. I have just had the phone for a couple weeks and I love it.
yes,yes,yes,I love the new s5 still finding new features daily
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone its making me concerned buying a tablet
yes,no,yes,I have had an iphone since the first one came out and I swore that I would not have anything other than an iphone. I have fallen in love with the galaxy S5. It has so many more features than my iphone 5. I promise you won't be disappointed if you get the galaxy S5.
yes,yes,yes,I have had the s5 about 3 weeks now and it is a great upgrade from the s3 which i loved. The features on the s5 are amazing i have gone 36 hours on a single charge! Nowhere near the life of my s3 and when i get around a certain percentage of battery i just turn on ultra power saving mode and...
no,yes,yes,I had a WINDOWS phone prior to obtaining this phone. Biggest problem with WINDOWS phone is lack of apps.
yes,yes,yes,I LOVE my new Galaxy S5! It's 4:15am and I'm STILL playing with it!
yes,yes,yes,I got me and my daughter 1 and we both absolutely love this phone. The only dislike is the recent app button I click it when I text once in a while but u learn to hold your phone different it's no a problem! !! Would not be able to go back to the iPhone or switch to anything else.
yes,yes,yes,I never thought that I would find a phone that hands down beats apple until this phone came out
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has a large screen which makes reading easy,,,, the fonts also increase without having to go to settings while you are in text mode. It is a breeze to navigate. You don't have to have a PHD in cellphones to use. There are many great free apps. The camera takes the most awesome pics."
yes,yes,yes,this is a great phone its just a ugly design and is water resistant
yes,yes,yes,So happy I finally jumped off the Iphone bandwagon! Still learning the differences but love it so far! Only problem is a lot of my friends and family still have Iphones so the software is not compatible.
yes,yes,yes,"Have used this for about 3 weeks without any major problems. It will occasionally freeze in games, but I think that is likely a problem with the game. I love the intuitive texting feature and Galaxy...Samsung's response to Siri."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this new phone!!! I had the samsung infuse before and really liked it. I have always used samsung phones I the past too. My husband talked me into going over to the iPhone, and I just didn't like it as much. I am an android person. I love all of the cool stuff this phone has to offer."
no,yes,no,You can look anywhere and get the features . But the kinks Only in a review; Some times I get a call and it says it's someone else sometimes I click to open a link and it takes me to device help page .
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from an iPhone 4s to a Samsung Galaxy S4 and have not regretted it since then. Shortly after the Samsung Galaxy S5 came out, I hopped on the train and upgraded again. What attracted me the most was the ""waterproof"" feature which allows up to 3ft of being submerged under water without..."
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded to the Samsung 5 the day it was released. I debated between the iPhone and Galaxy. I ultimately went with the Galaxy due to superior camera and bigger/clearer screen. I'm very pleased but honestly am still learning.
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased this S5 to replace my S4, just like I replace S2 with S4. it's as good, powerful and perfect as it says in Samsung's website. Very excellent operational experience. Samsung always gave us surprise which is beyond our expectation."
yes,yes,yes,"Love the samsung galaxy s5. Great features, super fast and takes awesome pictures"
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy S5 has so many cool features and i'm still trying to learn how to use it. So far I'm enjoying it and i'm glad that I decided to upgrade to this.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S 5 is amazing. My last phone was the Galaxy S 3 . I had no idea what i was missing!
yes,yes,yes,I just got this phone about a month ago but I have had other ones and love them. The size was hard for me to get used to but once I did I love everything about it. It also accidentally was dropped in the toilet not even a month old.
yes,yes,yes,I had the Galaxy S2 for a long time and was happy with it. Then I got this one and it is so much more. Very happy with it and would highly recommend it to anyone.
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone because one of my freinds at school showed it to me. I always turned my head to some other phone other than a i phone but once i seen the galaxy s5 i had to have one.
yes,yes,yes,The gs5 is an awesome phone I'm coming from a note 3. I've onlyrics had this phone for a about a week and a half and from the first day I got it I noticed the difference between the gs5 and note 3. I love the water resistant has to be the best feature I've found so far.
no,yes,yes,"The Usb cover broke when I open it to charge my phone ,I don't think is IPS approved mostly the water resistant part"
yes,yes,yes,"The new s5 is such a great phone. Fast downloads, kitkat, Im on a weightloss program and the fitness app preinstalled works well. pedometer and beats per minute on heart rate. Lightning fast processor and Bigger screen than my old s3....You womt be disappointed if you buy this phone."
yes,yes,yes,I have a s3 for about 1 1/2 year and I love it and now I have s5 now and I love the phone with it
yes,yes,yes,"The simple unimaginative features of the iPhone is why continue to use Samsung as my phone. I have an iPad, and this simple seeming interface of this phone, reminds me too much of it. Too many doors that lead to nowhere and categories that could all grouped together for a much better use of space."
yes,yes,yes,"I owned the S3 for a couple years, my friends all purchased the S4, and of course I was jealous, but lucky me... just picked up my S5 yesterday. Stayed up much of the night playing around with it, seeing its features and testing all it had to offer."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone I had before the S5 was the Note (the first one). The S5 kicks my Note's butt! The performance is fast, the screen is beautiful, the pictures that I have taken are VERY crisp, the application management is wonderful (I don't have to be stuck with stock apps)..."
yes,yes,yes,"Guys this galaxy s5 really sets the bar high, sleek design, immaculate camera and speedy performance should make this a no brainer. Love the new look to touchwiz htc and apple are no competition for this device"
yes,yes,yes,"Lightweight, love the back, easy to use lots of great features and good call quality."
yes,yes,yes,"I don't understand all of the reviewers who question if upgrading from Samsung's Galaxy S4 to S5 is worth it...or call it a ""minor upgrade"". All I can say is those reviewers either have an anti-Samsung bias, haven't tried the phone for any length of time, or are just plain idiots!"
yes,yes,yes,"I had been an iPhone user for almost 7 years since the 3G in 2007. I didn't think I'd ever switch to a new phone, but my husband talked me into getting this one, and if I didn't like it, I could go back to my iPhone. Well after having it just a few days, I'm NOT going back to my iPhone!"
yes,yes,yes,SO MUCH BETTER THAN ANY OTHER PHONE. IM IN LOVE! Valued Customer!
yes,no,yes,"Samsung continues to amaze me. I know you've heard that it's really like a Galaxy S4s, but I'm coming off a Galaxy S3 ...skipped the 4 and now I have the s5! I pre-ordered this and had it my hands April 10th 2014. It's faster...bigger...brighter and just way cooler!"
yes,yes,yes,"I had a Galaxy S3 and actually have a Galaxy S4, for me it's the great device in all of senses, I pretty love the camera features and the big screen. I'm excited about the new Galaxy S5, I can't wait for it"
yes,yes,yes,My first Samsung cell phone and i love it. I would definitely recommend this to friends.
yes,yes,yes,This is the 1st time that I've loved everything about a phone. I've never had any problems with my phone or my Boost service. I highly recommend Galaxy S5's to anybody not happy with their current phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Hello,this is dennis.and let me start off by saying,I truly love this phone.I really appreciate your way of making life easier.this phone is like having a v8 in a world of 4 cylinders lol.you ladies and gentlemen are awsome,so dont stop perfecting the items we love.thanks again"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the camera, and finger print scanner. It is great for if your trying to stay or get fit with the extra add ons. Plus its a Samsung, you cant beat the quality, always has great products. Wish it was a little less expensive but i do think its worth it!"
yes,yes,yes,"Very great phone with good features ,easy to use ,sound good ,waterproof"
yes,yes,yes,My first smart phone was a Samsung. When I was ready for an upgrade my kids talked me into an iPhone. I absolutely hated the iPhone. For me it wasn't nearly as easy to use and didn't perform nearly as well as my Samsung. I returned to Samsung as quickly as possible and love mt S5.
yes,yes,yes,This product allows me to go one more than one site at a time takes great pictures it also has a lot of features that most phones do not have overall is just great
yes,yes,yes,great speed fast access to any application i use fast and good download speed from the google play app and store.i love the screen how vivid it looks too many good functions to mentioned i need more time and space for real lol..
yes,no,yes,Received the S5 as a replacement for my S4 and it's just too large. The old size was perfect. Now I have to carry an extra bag just to carry my phone around. Not pleased.
yes,no,yes,"I love Samsung products, but I would like to see a failsafe function for when you damage the screen you could still use most functions of the phone via voice commands. For instance voice could open downloaded programs on the phone. And the speaker could be louder."
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone and all of its features but there are a lot of samsung apps that i do not use that i cant get off my phone. I also think the battery could be better but that could also have to do with all those apps
yes,yes,yes,For some reason it continues to hurt sd cards no matter which one I've used. The phone is a battery burner. Not more than 1 hour use under heavy use.
yes,yes,yes,"Always bought new budget phones and seen thes one for the same price and it being already a few years old blows all the new budget phones out of the water,my last samsung was a gs2 which i loves and missed until i picked this baby up."
yes,yes,yes,"This product has speed, durability, and many great features that are helpful to your everyday life. I recommend everyone get this phone or another one of the Samsung phones because they are great and desirable."
yes,yes,yes,"I recently purchased this phone & happy that I did so.Nice screen size,lightweight, beautiful design and takes great quality pictures.I highly recommended this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Unlimited apps that can be downloaded compared to an iphone . It has a good camera and good sound, as well as a big screen,it worth having one"

yes,yes,yes,No problems with it so far. I would tell everyone about this phone
yes,yes,yes,"The ohone has been working very good, I've had it for 2 years now and no problems yet. The price was expensive since I bought it from Boost and I would've liked it if it would've been at least unlocked"
yes,yes,yes,"After years of using the lower end smart phones, I upgraded. My Galaxy S5 is my first high end smart phone & I absolutely love it. Does everything I need it to do, it's fast, lots of storage, awesome camera & the price was perfect."
yes,yes,yes,"Had no choice but 2 switch 2 the s5, dont lik the fact i still cnt erase apps i dnt use! Pretty much the same as the s3 n s4, the camaras much better! Hate that i could only find it in white, battery drains so much faster then my s3, there's not 2 many full protection cases for s5."
no,yes,no,"The only problem is when I try to get to the internet, I get a message about my battery damaging my phone and it tell me to add apps.As will ALL cell phones the battery life is horrible."
yes,yes,yes,This device has a great design and it is really lightweight.
yes,yes,yes,"I had bought many cellphones with another brand. But they always made me regret fetting that phone, but then i finally decide to go with a samsung brand phone and it was the best decision ever."
yes,yes,yes,Its very lightweight and easy to use. With the different apps and health apps its essential. Unlike other phones you can switch between phone storage or your sd card.
yes,yes,yes,I have on my Galaxy S5 for 2 years now when I first got it it was exceptional after two years so it lags freezes up display doesn't work the back is falling off the performance is still good love the amount of memory that it will hold overall a good phone much better than any other phone I've ever...
yes,yes,yes,5 stars its a great phone and I highly recommend it
yes,no,no,Never had a problem with this phone. I have had it for 2 years and going.
no,no,no,the only problem I have with this phone is my phone screen have green lines flickering on the screen when I put the display brightness all the way down.... and goes away when I put the brightness back up....... I think it was caused by 1 of the lollipop Updates.

yes,yes,yes,"Over all this is a great phone, just some minor flaws. But it has great features"

yes,yes,yes,Meeting my expectations and so far very happy i have purchased this particular Samsung product.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is everything that I wanted, from the design to the features. It has quality performance and speed. I use it to do homework and even write some of my papers. The best phone I have owned in a very long time."
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I've owned by far.It's going to be hard for me to switch to the S6 because how awesome this S5 is.
yes,yes,yes,"I think Samsung cellphones are very easy to learn how to use. S5 is my personal phone and also the company that i work gave me a iphone 5S, I hate it. It's difficult, complex. I already bought i watch to use with my samsung and my driving time became easier, i don't need to reach my cellphone to see..."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had the S5 since Christmas ans it has been the best phone i have ever had. I have used the Iphone 6 and wasnt a fan of it,so i got the s5. With myslef being in school the s5 allows me to contact friends and teachers for help. I am style my phone in my own personality."

yes,yes,yes,I had better cell phone usage with my S2. I have trouble getting on the Internet with this phone and I've paying for unlimited data usage for over 4years now. I didn't change my plan either for that purpose. My apps keep disappearing off of my shortcut pages.

yes,yes,yes,"The phone has very few to negativities to it, with it's insanely fast 4g lte, incredible performance, and overall appeal. Only negative aspect is that the WiFi will force itself on, but a small burden when it doesn't affect battery life. I do not regret the decision to upgrade."

yes,yes,yes,"I had been using a Samsung S3 for a long time and finally chose to upgrade- a little late, I know, to an S5.

no,no,no,My S5 have been a solid work horse from day one. Only issue I've had was the headphone jack shorted out.
yes,yes,yes,"I love everything about this phone, it is fast, slim, easy to grip, and the battery life is AMAZING."
no,no,no,"It doesn't run as well as it should! With all its supposed to handle, it can't keep up and freezes and starts to glitch, too often than not."

yes,yes,yes,Love the phone. Was everything I needed but really didnt.
yes,yes,yes,Before purchasing the S5 I had an S3. I love the S5. I get good battery life. Great features. Easy to use.
no,yes,yes,"This is a great phone. My issue is that i have had to warranty this phone 3 times in 12 months. Lcd went bad on one, the antenna went out on the other, one wouldnt work at all."
yes,yes,yes,Love the galaxy series but the only negative is the price
yes,yes,yes,This phone is so sleek and innovative! The screen is very responsive and I never have issues with it. Learing how to use it isn't hard and the tutorials are very easy to understand. All in all it's a great phone and I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in buying.
yes,yes,yes,The product is good. Dependability is another issue. I spent to much time going back and forth to your Samsung professionals.
no,no,yes,I cant figure out how to transfer my pictures and videos to sd card. And there are too many pre installed apps I dont know how to use and dont want. Also these apps can not be deleted.
yes,yes,yes,its so far so good and it is durable i like the fingerprint sensor
yes,yes,yes,Have had this for a couple weeks and so far I love it.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone.. it's like having a mini computer in your pocket...
no,yes,no,"I have had to replace this phone because it would click on random things and not let me click anything. I went to the sprint store and they said they had no idea what was wrong with it, they said they would send me a brand new one for free."
yes,no,yes,The screen is very bright and the colors kind of jump out at you.
yes,yes,yes,I only recently got the Galaxy S5 shimmer and I absolutely love it. I had the S3 and figured id b forced to have to learn a whole new system. This was not the case. It was literally an upgrade with more functions and its easy to learn too. This has made life so much simpler and easier.
yes,yes,yes,Let me just start off by saying there is absolutely enough room on this page to even begin to tell you how much I love and enjoy this phone this phone is by far the best phone ever made I love the design of it to its nice sounding speakers and beautiful pictures Ive gotten few of my friends to...
yes,yes,yes,Every masterpiece is made up of small parts that all together make it great just like the samsung s5 is a small part of all the other great products samsung has made. Samsung has no competition with other products because its just so effortlessly good.
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone I have ever owned. I love everything about this phone. If I had to do it all over, I would choose the Samsung Galaxy S5. I love all the features. They are too many to name. But I would like to the highlight the feature that allows me to check my heart rate and stress level."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, had it since it was released. Great performance and hardware. Screen is a good size and display looks great. Pictures are normally crisp and clear, and the camera has plenty of settings. Onlu thing I disliked about the phone was the My Magazine feature."
yes,yes,yes,We have had great service and excellent reception data and call quality.
yes,yes,yes,Take this phone everywhere. Especially around water. Great phone. They should of added the water feature to all their phones.
yes,no,yes,The battery life is outstanding. Way better than any other phone I have owned. Features and choices are top shelf. One complaint is I am not able to use my phone due to it not being compatible with straight talk. I think that maybe a straight talk issue. I still use my galaxy s5 for everything.
yes,yes,yes,"This is the first phone i've ever had and it's great. I was looking on getting an ipone,but I am glad I choose this phone."
yes,no,yes,This was was average upon the first release and was soon replaced by the S6 models. It lagged in speed and ate up the battery. With the last software upgrade it has improved incredibly. Faster to execute apps and significant battery life increase.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has lasted over a year, it has been dropped, it has been wet and Ive even sat on it. Im well please with my features and benefits."
yes,yes,yes,"I've always liked Samsung because the screen is logical and it's fairly easy to master the use of it. However, I traded in my S3 mini for a Galaxy 5. This phone is so much faster, has more neat features, and I see much better with the large screen. I also like being able to use Google features."
yes,yes,yes,I love it I would recommend this phone to all of the people .. cool stuff to do in there. Great apps.
yes,yes,yes,Everything about this phone is great. I previously had a Windows Phone and after switching to this oh my gosh I could never go back. You can have up so many tabs and different apps.
yes,yes,yes,I had this phone on launch day and loved every min of it I have now upgraded to the note 5 and love that just as much
yes,yes,yes,This product is pretty good. Its much better than my last one and is more sufficient
yes,yes,yes,Fairly easy to learn features. Have owned for 1 year.
yes,yes,yes,It really is a quality product. Just wish it didn't have apps like beaming service and ant radio which I will never need added on.
yes,yes,yes,"I enjoy this phone, its nice and easy to use. Its not to big nor is it to heavy. I would buy it again if i could."
no,yes,no,I hate how I have had 5 phones in 16 months. Constantly getting issues that requires me to get a new phone. Very disappointed
no,no,yes,This my forth S5 since end of November 2014 I experienced two similar and on going issue with the same model. I am very unpleasant with the Samsung S5. I am in the process of talking with the service provider to replace or remove me from the leasing and also downgrade to my old phone S3.
yes,yes,yes,"So, I had a s3 and a Blackberry before that. Gave the s3 to my wife.As I get older I have a hard time with the typing. This s5 is much better. I know you aim your products at younger folks but older adults need a simple large keyboard and ease of use.Its light and fits in my shirt pocket."
yes,yes,yes,A QUICK NOTE TO TELL YOU THIS IS A WONDERFUL
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S5 is by far the best phone I've had yet. So much storage space and memory. Keep up the good work, Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,I love galaxy phones and I had the galaxy 3 before and the five is a good upgrade.
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone close to a year now. I'm not that good at using different features on smartphones. Samsung makes it a lot easier to navigate through all of the features offered.

yes,yes,yes,Good phone for the value. Does what you need in a smart phone.
yes,yes,yes,This phone can do anything you want and i love it!
no,no,no,I am not able to send picture messages. I do not have service anywhere. When i send text messages it just sits and spins so i never know if my message was sent or not. even if i am connected to wifi i still cant use the internet some times.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy 5 is the best smartphone I've ever had. It has all the features anyone could need.
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased a LG 4 and was not happy I took it back to Sprint and a friend told me about the Galaxy s 5 so i tried it and I love it, the more I search around on it the better in love. I would recommend anyone to purchase it."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the leather back, it's something different from the other galaxies. The camera is amazing, best phone so far!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"Overall a very good phone, not too big but not too small either. I don't use a lot of the Apps but it's nice that they are there."
yes,yes,yes,the picture quality could be a little better and it could be a little faster but all in all pretty good
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone its great, fast, And waterproof."
yes,yes,yes,Very good phone i like dis one better then any others
yes,no,yes,I love my Samsung galaxy s5!!! easy to use with great new features for all types of people. The only problem was connectivity. Whenever I tried to plug it into my computer it wouldn't connect saying it couldn't identify my phone :( that was the only problem.
yes,yes,yes,Many great features and very easy to use. I will recommend to everyone.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone it is easy to use. Has great features. Just watch out what you download because some apps will freeze up this phone easy.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had my Samsung Galaxy S5 since 3-13-15 from sprint. I love the phone and all the features that come with it. The only thing sometimes is the reception when your talking could b improved alot better and as far as the speed 4 the data, it could improve considerably."
yes,yes,yes,"I am still learning the phone, but I really like it. I love the messages--so easy to read & so easy to add contacts I like the variety of apps, but there are many I will never use."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone has awesome features and works very well had a s4 and update my phone to an s5 and am glad i did. Love all samsung products have no problem with any of them .whatever yoguys are doing keep it up working out great for u and the customer thank you so much.
yes,yes,yes,I have had my Galaxy S5 for about a year now so I hope that is enough time to give it a fair review. I loved my s5 from the moment I got it...then the honeymoon phase started to dwindle. My phone does great for the most part. The bad part tho...
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love my phone. Having to come from an IPhone to an android, it is by far the best phone I have had so far. It is very efficient, light on my hands and easy to conceal. I have yet to have any issues with my phone. I have dropped it many times and have seen how durable it is."
yes,yes,yes,"nice phone love it just got it in june and have had no issues, battery life is great"
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely love this phone it is very up to date and has a lot of great features

yes,yes,yes,Has the best of everything you would want in a phone
yes,yes,yes,The clarity on this phone's screen is unbelievablely vibrant!
yes,yes,yes,"I recently had to upgrade my phone-since my Samsung Galaxy S 3 died, I had it for 2 years and really liked it. I am not happy with my new phone at all. It is big and awkward. I do like the S5 better then the 6 though. The phone randomly dials people."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had several other phones; brands, models, styles, etc, and overall the Samsung Galaxy phones are by far the best. They are easy to set up, easy to operate, not too small or too large, but fits one's hand just right."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this phone for almost a month and so far I can find nothing to complain about. It has great ease of use, one handed opetation and lots of great features. I am vefy happy with my choice of this phone."
yes,yes,yes,i love having the galaxy 5. i love the s health and theres an app that turns your phone into a remote for your tv and it didn't even need to be a smart tv. it's easy to use after a small learning curve.
yes,yes,yes,"When my flip phone died, I just wanted a new flip phone. I was not interested in a smart phone. I did not need to get emails, search the internet, play games, take pictures, etc. I searched for a new flip phone, but the only one available had bad reviews, especially that it dialed 911 all by itself!"
yes,yes,yes,"Great speed, and an awesome camera it also has a awesome size screen for watching media. I would recommend this product to anyone that is inquiring about its features. A great buy at a great value."
yes,yes,yes,still getting used to the phone as I switched from IPhone to Galaxy but I really like everything that I do have figured out. the only con so far is the battery life isn't as long as I thought it would be and I can't control my Apple TV with my phone anymore
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy S5! The speed of the phone along with the pixels of the rear facing camera are amazing only thing i woild have to say negatively about it is that the screens break too easily
yes,yes,yes,"Love my Galaxy s5 cell, its water resistant, the sound quality is great and it charges extremely fast, can't go wrong with that!!!"
yes,yes,yes,I know i can live without this phone but i prefer not to. Its very Simple and seamless for my life. Love the camera too.
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely fell in love with my Samsung S5! This phone can do everything and more. The high definition is beautiful. It's smooth and sleek, yet has a screen just big enough to enjoy all of its features. I love to stream movies and shows when I want to just relax without being in front of the TV."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has great storage space. The quality you get streaming music, shows and movies awesome. I must say I have never seen so many options with a phone camera my personal favorite is using the double sided camera my two year old thinks its cool."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone. I can organize family event with ease. I highly recommend this phone
yes,yes,yes,This phone has all the features I was looking for.
yes,yes,yes,Best part about the phone is having that extra security of knowing is waterproof if I get caught out in the rain or I accidently drop it in the bathtub. I don't like putting the heavy waterproof cars on it so this phone is perfect. Love the big screen as well.
no,yes,yes,This phone is great except that is goes slow on certain apps
yes,yes,yes,Has everything you need battery time last.... quick connection
yes,yes,yes,I have used Samsung Galaxy phones for 3 years. The Galaxy 5 is my office on the go. Easy to use. No problem downloading apps. I would recommend it
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. Call quality is great. Picture quality is amazing
no,yes,yes,This phone does the job of a cell phone nothing more and nothing less
yes,yes,yes,"The new features are fantastic. The Wi-Fi calling is a great new feature. It comes with many preloaded apps. The display is great and I enjoy the speakers. My only complaint is that it shuts down too quickly if you don't immediately open after pressing the side button,"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome. I really like the fell and size. The layout is great. The apps that come with it are really cool.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is so incredible... Super user friendly. Amazing pictures. The sound is incredible. Absolutely everything about this phone is amazing, I honestly can not say enough about it. the speed in mind blowing, security is top notch. I do everything on it from games to banking. Love it!!"

yes,yes,yes,"I like my phone, theres just a few things i dont like about it but other than that its a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,"It does everything I need and more, works good and fast"
yes,yes,yes,"As a previous owner of galaxy S4, I had to get the updated S5 once It came out. I don't regret it one bit! Battery last way longer, charges faster also. I use my phone A LOT and this phone can last me all day. I love it!"

yes,yes,yes,"I have had no problem with this phone whatsoever, it is the best phone I have ever had"
no,no,yes,loved the phone--loved. The screen doesnt shatter like previous generations of smart phone when dropped...THE ENTIRE SCREEN JUST STOPS WORKING ALL TOGETHER!!!! There isnt even a crack in the screen. everything looks perfectly fine except the screen wont come on at all.
yes,no,yes,"Very impressed with the S5. Literally, the only downside to this phone is the battery life after updating to lollipop. If Samsung gets this foxed it would be a 5☆ device easily."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the picture and video quality my Samsung Galaxy 5 takes, when compared to Apple iPhones. I also love the health built-in features of the phone and GPS tracking using Google Maps."
yes,yes,yes,"I love Samsung 100%. I would love for ""I"" anything to be ran over by a bus. I really think the Samsung note edge topped it off. I don't own one but I CANNOT wait to get one! My cons are they are a little too expensive. Chemotherapy and medications take most of my budget!"
no,yes,no,"I'm not impressed or satisfied at all with this phone. It shuta off all the time. My screen will go black in the middle of doing stuff. I've reset it, deleted all my apps turned it off and on numerous times. I hate it."
yes,yes,yes,Everything is perfect I'm in love with my phone my boyfriend bought it for me and he plans on getting one aswell
yes,no,yes,"It's a good phone. Not much of an upgrade over the s4. Decided on this phone essentially because of the water resistant design. Would be a better review if I was still on Verizon. Sprint is horrible, don't switch."
yes,yes,yes,I had a samsung galaxy s5 after having a note 3. I have a preference of the note so i exchanged for a samsung galaxy note 4. The s5 is a great phone for someone who has never had a note but overall it is a great phone. Also the waterproof is an awesome thing. That phone will last people a long time.
no,no,no,"S5 has slow performance, and looks not much of different from s4. Thus, I have upgraded to s5 just 1 month for now and yet my camera keeps ""warning: camera failed."""
yes,yes,yes,I made the switch from an Iphone to Samsung and it's been great! It's really easy to use and doesn't give me the issues I had with my old phone.
yes,no,yes,Better than my III. Chews through the battery. Have to charge twice a day at least unless I leave it on battery saver mode. Got ads for apps constantly until I figured it out. Sound quality is good. Better than the III. Go for the 6 if you can.
yes,yes,yes,"I wil be 75 on May 20, 2015 and have never used a smart phone. A friend showed my husband his new smart phone of a different brand and my husband convinced me that I should get one."
no,yes,no,"I would have given this phone a higher rating however, the phone seems to have an ongoing issue with the camera, and other embedded feature repeatedly shut down when i try ti use them, like the camera, clock, alarm the calendar etc, i have to then re start the phone to get them to work, i even tried..."
no,yes,yes,"I like the phone, just make sure you buy a case for it. Screen and sides are fragile."
yes,yes,yes,"I used to love this phone until after the update. I have had ghost dialing and text. It freezes, has errors and no one seems to know exactly why. I have reset it but still having issues. I need a reliable phone. Samsung has disappointed."
yes,yes,yes,Went from the 3 to the 5 and LOVE LOVE LOVE. SPEED LOOKS CAMERA EVERYTHING IS FANTASTIC
yes,yes,yes,Samsung has great products. I have had 4 Galaxy phones and they were all great. Can't wait 4 the S6 to come out!!!
yes,yes,yes,"Screen is great. The accuracy when tapping is perfect. Screen not as big as I want it to be, but the screen is pretty awesome! Features are sweet and amazing. Love all the customizable things when using this phone. Works great camera is one of the best and pretty much flawless. Top 5 phones to me."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, excellent camera, fast, fluid, fingerprint scanner, heart rate scanner, all in all super! :-)"
yes,yes,yes,"I like the Samsung Galaxy S5. Its has great photo quality. Great display and nice speakers. However, there was a recent update, and that update makes absolute no sense. I don't mind the change to the notification bar or that we can see our notifications on the lock screen."
yes,yes,yes,"I love Samsung and this phone. This is my 2nd s5. I was going to switch, but naaawww"
yes,yes,yes,"This was a fantastic phone until the new software Lollipop was launched ahead of time and completely killed the battery power. The number one reason I purchased the Galaxy instead of HTC was the battery longevity, had to hardset my phone back to factory setting and KitKat software to ensure battery..."

yes,yes,yes,I really like how easy this phone is to ise. Everything at your fingertips. Not difficult.
yes,no,yes,I needed a phone that could handle both personal and business tasks. Throughout the day I'm constantly replying to emails and messages and talking on the phone. I needed a phone that could handle all the tasks I throw at it and can work as hard as I do. Samsung really hit it out of the park.
yes,no,yes,"this phone has everything you need , I use my galaxy 5 for work ,making appointments, taking pictures of job progress, and my clients are just one button away.my phone and my 60 inch flat screen tv are Samsung and work excellent."
no,yes,no,"The phone looks good and have a great interface. However, it started acting up two weeks after I bought it. First it lost activation and I had to call my carrier to get it reactivated. After another week, it lost activation again! Did it three more times!"
yes,no,yes,The Galaxy S 5 is the consummate phone. It can handle my work life and my home life keeping things separate and keeping me in the know.Performance is unmatched. I compare this phone continuously to my wife's iPhone and there is nothing the iPhone offers that the S5 cannot match.

yes,yes,yes,"I'm a super user and tough on phones -- I went through two Nexxus phones in 9 months. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is sleek but sturdy, provides lightning fast speed and terrific performance."
yes,yes,no,"The Galaxy S5 was the obvious upgrade for me after loving my Galaxy S3. Unfortunately, the phone is setup to use Sprint Spark, a network that likely won't be online until after I upgrade again. Hence, as soon as you make a call, it turns off all of your data. No more searching while you talk."
yes,yes,yes,"This cell phone has been one of the most excellent Phones i have had. I have jumped around from Iphone6 to Nexus 5 Back to Iphone and i Always Land back to My S5. Its Fast, Slim, Vibrant Screen, Great Battery Life. No complains whatsoever"

yes,yes,yes,great phone to help get the job done. Sleek and all the extras are great. The water resistance is so helpful.
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S5 is one of the greatest phones I've ever had. I love the speed, the display, and the user interface which is so easy to learn and user friendly. I like the fingerprint screen lock feature to protect my information. I love ""OK GOOGLE"" as well."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. Its everything that I thought it would be, and more. Only problem that I have is that I killed the battery. I made the mistake of charging it over night a few times, and now it doesn't hold its charge well. The battery seems a little swollen."
yes,yes,yes,Everything that you need and more in this phone!!!
yes,no,yes,"Once again Samsung has proven to be the best in the industry. I wouldnt trade my S5 for a box of iphones. Graphics are beautiful, and I can run multiple applications without lag. Forget about purchasing the new bendable(defect) iphone!"
yes,yes,yes,"I received this phone from Samsung as a tester, i did not plan on upgrading from my S4. Battery life is great, screen is great and Sprint has finally opened WIFI calling, love it all."
yes,yes,yes,I was an iphone user for 7 years until i got my galaxy S5. It was my first android device and i can say that it lives up to its reputation and delivers everything that my iphone could not.
yes,yes,yes,First off let me say simply amazing. Brilliant schemes light weight design and very responsive. From the 16mp camera to the slim light weight interface. Having this phone is virtually like owning a high end portable computer.
yes,yes,yes,"Screen size excellent, color excellent, included S Health app excellent, camera options excellent"
yes,yes,yes,"This is by far one of the best Samsung phones I've ever owned. Great battery life, amazing camera, super nice screen size, and lightweight. I barely use my laptop PC anymore. I got everything I need in this baby."

yes,yes,yes,"Waoo my cell phone is good I'm so happy every time, every day,"
yes,yes,yes,"Okay, it has a much better (not to mention bigger) screen than the very old Nexus One it replaces, but a couple of things smack of poorly thought-out design, including the power key, which is almost impossible to activate without changing the ringer volume by pushing the keys on the opposite side of..."

yes,yes,yes,"I have been a user of the ""other"" phone since phones were developed. I found it difficult to switch between the two. Having only a month trial to get used to this phone, I decided that my brain would be better served by going back to the one I was more accustomed to using, however, I have been sorry..."
yes,yes,yes,This galaxy s5 is amazing! It is fast and intuitive.
yes,yes,yes,This is not my first Samsung phone but it is certainly the best phone I have ever had. I have persuaded Iphone users to switch because of this awesome phone! I love it would not trade it for the world.
no,yes,no,I like this new galaxy however I dont like the pulg in for the charger as it can be easily broken and you have to be careful in placement.
yes,no,yes,"The finger print recognition is awesome. And when someone calls you and you are using your phone, there is small box appears, if u pick up, silence or hang up. Last but not least the camera, its amazing."
yes,yes,yes,I like my new Galaxy S5. The battery life is what attracted me in the first place. It charges very quickly with the included charger so even if it does get low you aren't attached to an outlet. The processor is quick and I haven't had it crash once yet. Very good quality.
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung Galaxy s5. This phone has a lot of features and the camera takes great pictures. I like the big screen and would recommend it to my friends and family.
yes,yes,yes,"Although it basically has all the features and performance that I want, the only problem I had was the latch broke off where the USB port is!"
yes,no,yes,i love the phone but could improve battery life. and improve the samsung keyboard to be better at next word predictions. and its hard to unlock the phone while driving using the finger print scanner so please make it easier for it to read my finger print in any angle i place my finger would be very...
yes,no,yes,"The features are great, a definite step-up from my old HTC. I don't like that my battery dies down too quickly, even when I turn on the ""power saving"" feature. And the design has this really quirky and fragile charging cover."

yes,no,yes,"I had the Samsung Galaxy sIII for the last year and a half and I just upgraded to the Galaxy s5 today, and I absolutely love it so far. There are so many new options and different things I can now do on my phone. I am so excited to see what else this thing can do!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone and features. Just one complaint....gave up the Droid Razr Maxx for the Galaxy S5, and was disappointed to find that unlike the Razr Maxx, I have to purchase special accessories to be able to connect my phone to my television. I used the razr Maxx to watch ALOT on my television."
yes,yes,yes,The galaxy s5 has everything I could ever want in a phone. Its just the right size and very light weight. The touchscreen is not sensitive at all as in some phones are. Very easy to use and understand all of its functions.
yes,yes,yes,I love the new USB 3.0. I haven't used it for transferring data but I can charge the phone in an hour. The battery lasts me a day no problem. I'm used to charging my phone overnight but I could go another 1/2 day or maybe a how day.The colors are bright and so it the screen.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I have EVER had! Love all the features except the magazine section when you scroll to the left only complaint I have!
yes,yes,no,EVERY THING IS REMARKABLEPLEASE CHECK THIS INFORMATION OR ASK PEOPLE ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND I AM SHORE IT WILL BE FIX.
yes,yes,yes,"Love, love, love it. So happy I went with this phone suggested by my son. Easy to operate, great pictures and lots of free easy app.s."
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. I was very unhappy with my iPhone 4 as it was just so small. I shopped a lot for this and made the switch. I do miss playing Mermaids and would like to see it on the larger screen.
yes,no,yes,"I love the S5 a lot. The ONLY complaint that I have is the flimsy port cover that covers the charging port. Within a few months of having the phone with normal wear and tear, the port cover fell off of my phone causing the phone to no longer have the water resistant feature."
yes,yes,yes,"I used to be Iphone user, until I had the galaxy s3 and then my wife asked me the galaxy s4 that impressed but with the galaxy s5 started my love for Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm getting old and little screens do nothing for me. Was going to wait for the Note 4.0, but decided this was a better fit for my lifestyle and pocket size. Only glitch I hit was the phone came set to""easy"" which disabled a lot of the camera function."
yes,yes,yes,I was hesitant to choose the S5 due to a couple of annoyances with my previous Samsung phone. Samsung must have listened to customer feedback because the details that had annoyed me were fixed. The charging port design is now sturdy and adapts to using old Samsung chargers as well.

yes,yes,yes,"I had a Galaxy S3 which was a great phone. I upgraded the the S5 and once again I am please. My only complaint is that the email app has trouble deleting emails. I delete a message, and then whenever the phone syncs up to retrieve new emails the ones I deleted come right back."
yes,yes,yes,"I had the Galaxy SIII and then decided to upgrade my phone, i got the Galaxy S5 and I'm very happy with it."

yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy S II was my first dive into the smartphone world. I immediately fell in love. It was a beast of a phone until about two years in when it started malfunctioning. No big deal I guess. I swore I'd stay with Samsung for life until purchasing the S5.
yes,yes,yes,The S5 has been the best phone i have had to date! All of the features make it a super easy phone to use but also make things in life so much easier. The fact that it is water resistant is just an extra plus because as y'all know most of tend to drop our phones occasionally!
yes,yes,yes,"I have used a verity of mobile phones but this seems to be top notch! After a few minutes/hours most people learn all functionally of a new cell. With my new Samsung, I am still finding out new functions. It's great! This is my backup phone and I will upgrade my main phone with Samsung."

yes,yes,yes,"I updated my S2 to the S5 and i could not have been more happy, im not sure about the models in between but the addition of the little things like being able to group message with Iphone users, as well as use emojis, and even up to the bigger things like the s health application and the use of a..."
yes,yes,yes,Love the Features!Can wait for was next :)
yes,yes,yes,It is the fastest phone I've ever owned. The features of privacy are outstanding. Speed and overall performance blows away all others in the field. I would be lost without my G5. I've own the G3 and my son has a G4 and the difference is like night and day.The design of the G5 works well for me also.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had several different phones thru the years, but I must say this one (Galaxy S5) is the best of the best. My son has tried every phone in the Galaxy line and recommended that I try it. At that time the S4 was being released. Of course I was reluctant and didn't try."

yes,yes,yes,"The resolution of this phone is awesome, the richness of the pictures are unbeatable. Is fast smart phone"
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, not a fan of the design it could be a little slimmer and less heavy. The touch pad is a pain, when you slide your finger across the skin rubs off on the mettalic lip on the ridge of the phone. Also having to slide your finger is not only inaccurate but also time consuming."
no,no,yes,"This phone has it all, from the 16mp camera to the fingerprint scanner, etc. I mostly purchased this phone because it's a Samsung product and for the IP67 certification making it water resistant and dust proof."

yes,yes,yes,I love my phone and the features. the picture quality is great. I am looking forward to when my network area gets 4g lte. I am looking forward to faster speed and downloads. this is a great phone overall. I have had others and this one is better
yes,yes,yes,"I love the feature that my phone becomes a pedometer, and even checks my pulse."

yes,yes,yes,I never used a cell phone as a computer or camera before but I am sure glad I do now! I have had this phone for a few months and I still cannot believe all I can do with it. It makes accessibility to whatever I need so much easier than before.

yes,yes,yes,I love my new Samsung Galaxy S 5 . Love the camera!!
yes,yes,yes,Switched from the S 3 to the S 5 and so far I am loving it! The camera takes amazing pictures and the phone is extremely faster than my S 3. It is also the lightest phone I've ever had. Only had it for a week so far and can't wait to see what it can do.
yes,no,yes,"At first, there were a few hiccups in that I needed to learn how to ""talk"" to my new Samsung Galaxy. That is understandable.With a little help from the techs, I learned how to navigate around the S5 (had a S2 before). Great! I thought I was ""in""."
yes,yes,yes,"My only complaint is the battery runs down quickly. It takes great pictures, easy to move from one screen to the next."

yes,yes,yes,Best phone ive had yet lots of standard features
no,yes,no,I reviewed the specs on this device before getting one and I am happy to say that this Phone does not disappoint. . Call clarity is second to none and even in places that were crowded and noisy I was able to hear the person calling me.
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love this phone! The camera, the software, and sleek style. I couldnt wait to get my hands on it and now im in love."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone with all the features, it's easier for me to listen to my music and tv shows and the GPS is awesome"
yes,yes,yes,"So far, I cant find anything I don't like about this phone. I upgraded from a Galaxy S3, which i also loved. I skipped the S4 because my S3 was pretty new when it came out and it wasn't worth the cost for me. This S5 has so many new features. The screen is amazing. The camera....wow."
yes,yes,yes,The reception and the ease of use is more than expected.
yes,yes,yes,I just wish they had more color option when I bought it. They just got the white and gray at that time. Now they have the gold one. I wanted that one.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has all of the features I need, and more! When my husband and I went out to breakfast shortly after I got the S5 we ordered and he pulled out his older phone to read the paper. I took out the S5 and opened the FlipBook and he was instantly jealous!"

yes,yes,yes,The gs5 is a stellar phone with more pros than cons. The super amoled display is amazing and the 5.1 inch screen is in my opinion the perfect size. The camera is great and I really like the water and dust resistance features. The only cons would be the lackluster speakers and the plastic build.
yes,yes,yes,"I love to take pictures, so with all the space and different options, it makes it so much better. The bright display and vibrant colors are great as well. So many great things about this phone."
yes,no,yes,"Wow! I can see the stuff on the screen. . .and the battery lasts many times longer than the phone it replaced, It's so cool that it takes my blood pressure, I can play games, and stay in touch with my Facebook friends, too. It has so so many features."

yes,yes,yes,"I love the look of the phone, the clarity of the screen and the sound although I wish the speaker would be louder for work and outdoors, it is perfectly loud enough for the house I love this product and the fact I don't have to be so careful around liquids since I work around water every day love..."
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung Galaxy S5 is everything I hoped it would be. After being an iPhone user for 10 years, I swithched to the galaxy S5 after a 10 minute product demo! This phone is eveything I hoped for, and never ceases to amaze me. It suits and enhances my lifestyle."
yes,yes,yes,We got to admit that iPhone is a very friendly phone. I learned how to use it really fast. I have the Galaxy S5 since 3 weeks ago (aprox) and.....I'm still learning myself. I went to a lot of web pages about tutorials and stuff. But I like the Galaxy a lot....I will dominate it...
yes,yes,yes,Very good connection. .. very good apps ... very good camera + display. ......
yes,yes,yes,"At first I wasn't a big android phone just from using my dad's for s bit of time and got an iPhone as soon as I could. But as time had gone by, I started to notice that iPhones weren't really changing much, and they seem to lack a major change, so I decided to try it android, namely the Samsung S5."
yes,yes,yes,I'm not really good at understanding electronics but my galaxy 5 is so user friendly that my 5 year old grandson can use it. I really enjoy it and wouldn't want any other phone. Never seen a phone that focuses so much on health it's great.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone by samsung I ever had. This is how to improve a phone. It has gotten better and better each time but this is by far the best...... this is coming from a person that every appliance in my house is by Samsung. .... its money well spent!!!!
yes,yes,yes,There are so many things that this phone can do. I went on youtube and found out even more features.
yes,yes,yes,"This cell phone seems to be light years ahead of my previous one from last year, and I could go on and on about its great features.

yes,yes,yes,Battery life great
yes,yes,yes,This phone is easy to learn and runs fast.

yes,yes,yes,I like my Galaxy s5 still learning how to use everything. Not getting much 4G on mydevise.
yes,yes,yes,The size is what drew me to this phone - it is larger and easier for me to read - the screens are so responsive to touch and the camera takes fantastic pictures.
yes,yes,yes,I'm sorry but it is 2014 and if you still think iPhone or any other android can out do the Galaxy phones you are wrong! The Galaxy S5 has the best design and is the most user friendly!
yes,yes,yes,Enjoying my new phone. I would recommend this product.
yes,no,no,I previously had the S3 and It was so far and beyond any phone I had prior so after I passed on the s4 and the s5 was coming out I decided to upgrade because my phone was cracked and the battery died 3 times a day so It was either always on the charger or I was replacing the battery every couple...
yes,yes,yes,Great battery life. Amazing sound quality. I'd highly recommend it!
no,yes,no,"After 5 weeks of problems with my brand new phone, I took it to the sprint store and I had a ""bad antennae""-----it's brand new, how??? Sprint replaced it and since I have had so many problems, I don't know if it was worth the $$$$ spent. Haven't learned all the new features b/c it didn't work."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the Samsung Galaxy S5!! It's perfect for everything. I upgraded from an iPhone 5, I'll never look back. Great battery life, awesome apps. I absolutely love the MILK music app among all the others."
yes,yes,yes,Best phone iv'e ever had. Still trying to figure out how to take great photos with the new camera features. Great design and feel. I need a Smart Watch now!
yes,yes,yes,"Let me be clear, the two things I value most when it comes to a cell phone is battery life and talk time. Because first and foremost I use this as a phone for emergencies, memories, business transactions, and random conversations."
yes,yes,yes,"I am so glad that I switched back to Samsung. I thought I wanted to be on the iPhone bandwagon. No way! This phone does everything I need. Work, school, social. It's all wrapped up into one. I like the slim design and the bigger screen. The screen is so bright. I don't know why I ever left."
yes,yes,yes,I got my new S5 less than 24 hrs ago and I am loving it! Blazing speed and i love the S Heath app and the heart rate monitor. I am glad that I waited until the S5 to upgrade.
no,yes,no,This phone needs 32 gb! I only have 5 more gb to go because of apps that are pre-installed & other apps that are downloaded on my phone. I even have a 64 gb memory card installed but because the pre-installed apps won't go onto my mem card it's useless.
yes,yes,yes,Love it! Everything is great! Thanks for making it waterproof and giving the guerrilla glass standard! looks great works great. I've had t since debut day and no issues yet! it was a great upgrade from the S3.
yes,yes,yes,"If you want the greatest cell phone that has reinvented technology, the Galaxy S5 is the game changer. Basically a super computer in the palm of your hand, there isn't very much this device can't do. Nothing shy of simply amazing!"
yes,yes,yes,"As an upgrade from an older iPhone 4S, I was looking for numerous improvements on whatever phone I upgraded to. An improved camera was near the top of my list, and the Galaxy S5's camera has proven to be a great step forward."
yes,yes,yes,"I have heard about the S5 and my daughter is very happy with her S3, so I thought I would splurge and upgrade my phone. I am very happy with it so far. It is big but the screen is so clear and I love all the features."
yes,yes,yes,"I have been a Galaxy user since galaxy 2 I loved it!! I also have a Note 3 but my glaxay s5 is AMAZING!!! My camera, the features the pixels im so in love with my phone!!!!! Great job Samsung!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from a Galaxy S3 about a month ago. Battery life is a very good (sometimes I get 3 days) Camera is awesome, speed with spark rocks. Overall if I to buy another phone today this would be the phone I bought."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is fast,reliable, awesome battery life and all the features you need."

yes,yes,yes,"After having the phone for about a month now, I am adjusted from the S4. One of the greatest features is you don't have to worry about getting it wet and you don't have to have a bulky case to keep it protected. It is fast, has the best camera and I can do everything on this phone."
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I've ever used by far. I used to have an i phone and switched over.
yes,no,yes,"Finger Print Scanner really works, faster, brighter, and I haven't even explored all the new features. I also have the pleasure of adding a Gear 2 and they were made for each other. I haven't found a single negative thing to date."
yes,no,yes,This is a solid handset with some innovative features (things like the heart monitor and fingerprint sensor). The main problem for Sprint customers is that some advanced features like the download booster and Wi-Fi calling have been disabled. It's a shame to cripple a powerful device.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S III and I have to say that the Galaxy S5 is a major step forward! The phone has a beautiful 1080P display that's super power efficient when being used. The phone moves quickly and is very responsive and a lot of bloatware has been removed.
no,no,no,I'm seeing some problems when I'm on a call/or not(I have the s-view case) and the phone will not come from out of sleep mode. The two buttons on the bottom will light up but the screen will not come on when I hit the power button or home button.
no,yes,yes,"I was so excited to land the S5, however, that excitement quickly turned to disappointment. First, the ability to surf the internet while talking on the phone is gone, The signal on this phone is worthless. I rarely move past one bar while my Motorola photons bars are full."
yes,yes,yes,I just got my new Galaxy S5 today and I am already in LOVE with it! It has some great new features that I can't wait to get into. I will update my review in a couple of weeks after I have had a chance to really check it out but I have no doubt it will be a great review.

no,yes,yes,I would rather have a touch screen but had to get this as upgrade. I hate the camera & messagin cause there's too many steps to get threw. I can't even use text on short codes. Never would buy one.

yes,yes,yes,"I recently upgraded to a Samsung S5 16GB, and have nothing but great things to say! This was a budget-friendly purchase, as my mobile carrier only keeps the Certified Pre-Owned models in stock. As a mother, my biggest priorities are staying connected and keeping my family safe and organized."
yes,yes,yes,I have enjoyed my phone so far and found it to be easy to operate and maintain the apps I need. It charges quickly the built in speaker is great.

yes,yes,yes,"This phone has been a great phone for me. I dont need the latest technology but it still does everything the big phones do. The screen is big but not huge.

yes,yes,yes,Love galaxy products especially the cameras.
yes,yes,yes,"Until this latest software update, my Galaxy S5 WAS tolerable*, NOW, I'm ready to smash the thing with a sledgehammer and get something else!This latest update is junk!

yes,yes,yes,I use my phone for work and personal applications. It feels intuitive and uncomplicated to use. It's easy to upload and save all the different documents I have to review and I can share it with ease
yes,yes,yes,"This phone seems to work reasonably well most of the time. It has a few really nice features like the 16MP camera, pulse monitor, pedometer, and water resistance. It's thin, lightweight, pretty easy to use. It seems to get bogged down quicker than it should when a few apps are open at once."
yes,yes,yes,"Nothing much new here, I'm not a techy so what's important to to me (calls, music, storage, etc) this phone does exactly as I want it to. Found the perfect case and the phone fits great in my hand. Still getting used to all the features but I'm sure it's as user friendly as everything else"

yes,yes,yes,I got a Samsung phone for my wife (which Samsung model hardly matters) and she fell in love. My brand new phone from my company was supposedly the flagship phone for a major manufacturer and it was great - or so I thought until I sat side-by-side with my wife and her Samsung!

no,yes,no,Liked this set up for a phone as could add memory and change battery. Not bothered about it being plastic as always put in a high tec case so the only part you saw was the screen. Is still going strong with all original parts and had no repairs. Keeping as spare in case my S7E goes bad.

yes,yes,yes,Phenomenal phone great screen awesome display and nice design with Quad-core processor able to carry out all necessary functions running lollipop.
yes,no,yes,I Love All Galaxy Phones Especially Notes The Only Reason Why I Give The Performance A 4/5 Is That At Some Points In Time It Gets Really Slow And Requires A Restart Of The Phone...I Also Wish It Was Running The Newest Version Of The Operating System ( Right Now It Would Be Marshmallow )
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely loved my S5 (still do!). It had a great camera with plenty of modes, a pretty loud little built-in speaker, and lots of customizability. Plus, that thing was built like a tank (several drops and not a scratch) and with a replaceable battery, it was probably the best phone I've owned to..."
yes,yes,yes,"After owing an S1, S3, S5, and having hands on experience with the S6, and S7, I still feel that Samsung hit the nail on the head with the S5. While the screen definition isn't as good as my wife's S7, it fully meets my expectations, and is more than adequate for Netflix, and Youtube while I'm..."

no,no,yes,The size of the unit takes some getting used to.Sending messages is easy as the letters seem to change as necessary. If you use the sameAll of the corrections are readily available. You do not have to search screen after screen
yes,yes,yes,"Since I got it I fell in love with it, I always recommend to my friends but unfortunately there so hook on the Iphone, but for me there is nothing like Samsung Galaxy."
no,no,no,I have had to exchange it twice do to it freezing all the time. It had gotten to the point that I can't even make emergency calls because it's frozen. I have had this one for a week and already it freezes and I can feel it vibrating while the system crashes.
yes,yes,yes,This device is far better than any Apple device I have ever used. It has a large variety of apps to have fun with and enjoy with your friends. I'm never going back to the ios devices ever this phone changed my view on cellular devices just with its overall functionality.
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone. Once I learned all the features it was a breeze to operate. Love Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,One of my favorite features with my Samsung Galaxy 5 is the water protection. With this winter around the corner it's nice to know I'll be able to talk on the phone in the rain need be with no worries. Another favorite feature of mine is the finger print security lock.
yes,yes,yes,"Really liked my Galaxy S, and the S5 is so much better. More power, faster, and more capabilities. Especially like how it tracks my steps (no need for a fitbit). Also like the ability to block sounds at night like phone calls except from specific numbers."
yes,no,yes,If it had a stylus pen that would make it even better.
yes,yes,yes,"Bright color, sharp images, and easy to use!!!! The screen is just the right size (not too big or too small). Just love the fact that I'm able to download a lot my favorite music into this phone....Really awesome!!!"

yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great, I have it, most of my friends as well or they have a new model of it, it does everything I need it for, I don't have any problems with it just the usual like the charger giving out, it not small or too big,I've dropped multiple times time and time again, never bought a case for..."
yes,yes,yes,"overview: A very solid phone that is light, thin, and has features that everyone can tailor to their own experience and needs. It has a sleek design with some neat features and compatibility with thousands of handy apps."
yes,yes,yes,"With the new updates on the S5 this phone is working great,and does a good job of what I need it to do.Games,music through Bluetooth, photos everything u need a phone to do,and have a slight hearing problem yet the phone is clear and sounds great."
no,yes,no,Received a faulty replacement phone that's worse then the phone being replaced.
yes,yes,yes,Product has great features and they are easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,It takes great pictures. I have more space on this phone. I love Samsung phones.
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love my SG5!!! The performance,price,design,and value are all above satisfaction! I recommend the SG5 to all my friends,family,and coworkers."
yes,yes,yes,This is a good product for the money. I like the support from Samsung.
yes,no,yes,I like being able to use a micro SD memory card. I like the ability to be able to swap batteries. I also like the dust/water resistant features.I think that the camera would be nicer if it had a larger aperture because exposure = the product of the f-stop (aperture) and the amount of time for light...
yes,yes,yes,"Finally, Samsung has truly made a HUGE improvement over their prior galaxy phones. The design is sleeker, the features are more robust and the colors are vibrant. What I like the most is the ability to connect your S5 to the computer, tv or any other device in the household."
no,yes,no,"I am pretty disappointed in this phone. I originally purchased a Galaxy 5s last April. Since then I've had 4 handset exchanges. My new problem is freezing. The last phone, the aux port stopped working, prior to that another issue that was attributed to the latest software update."
yes,yes,yes,Easy to use and fast great pictures. Haven't had any problems.
yes,yes,yes,the pictures are great the phone is so easy to use. It would have been nice if they would have gave more ring tone options. i was worried about how thin it is but i got an otter box for it that salved that. it`s alittle pricey shop around thats what i did.
yes,yes,yes,I love the fact that I can take it underwater and take great pics and videos
yes,yes,yes,This phone has revolutionized the way I feel about android. I cannot have an device without touchwiz. It enhances everything and makes it simple to use for all types of users. S Voice is the feature I love the most because it makes reminders hard to miss.
yes,yes,yes,Great specs. Great price range. Great tab size. Love It
yes,yes,yes,Good product. Reliable & Consistent! It is a laptop in your pocket.
yes,no,yes,"I was ready to upgrade my S3 and I looked around at other phones, but since I was on my third Samsung phone with no issues and didn't feel the need to spend the extra money on the S6 (and had wanted the S5 for awhile now) it was an easy decision."
yes,yes,yes,Thids devicewas great i wish they would have continued the water safe feature to the note 5 and 6 edge +
yes,yes,yes,"The phone has a lot of great features. It also has a removal battery, a must have in my book. It also has micro SD card expansion. The only complaint I have is the upgrade process to Android 5 is not as smooth as I like. It took me a while to iron out all the upgrade problems."
yes,yes,yes,Good solid phone that does what a phone can do at this time.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has lived up to it name! I have enjoyed it and feel like I am still using the best technology. The phone has been rained on, and dropped in a pool and no water damage whatsoever. I am just waiting for the Samsung 7!"
yes,no,yes,"As I have stated before Samsung does it again. I own a Galaxy S5 (AT&T), Tab2, Tab4, Galaxy 2, and this one a S5 (T-mobile). I plan on getting a note 4 soon (as soon as I get the money) the quality of the display is amazing."
yes,yes,yes,I previously had the SII and it was very slow compared to this model. I do own the S6 Edge and it's the best phone I've ever had. The S5 certainly comes in 2nd place. It's easy to use and was please it came with the finger print scanner.
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone only for the exception of the front camera, it should definitely be improved. Besides that everything works great."
yes,yes,yes,"The longer I have my Samsung Galaxy S5, the more I like it. In fact it has become my pretty constant and reliable companion, which isn't necessarily a good thing for a piece of technology to be but it is what it is."
yes,yes,yes,no complains as of yet. keep up the good work. and thank you.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has everything I could possibly want in a cell phone. Great features and exceptionally durable considering I put it through a lot at work as well as play. Thank you an d I can't wait to be able to afford the 6.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Gs5, I think my Gs5 is better than any other phone out, especially the Iphone.."
yes,yes,yes,I really like the S5 it is a very good phone that is reliable
yes,yes,yes,great phone like the features the camera takes great pictures went with samsung because I had a galaxy s2 never had a problems with it had to switch carriers so time to up grade so there was no question I wanted another samsung
yes,yes,yes,Out of all the phones I have had over the years this is my ultimate favorite. I couldn't have fine or purchase a better phone then this. I LOVE MY SAMSUNG GALAXY S5.
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a great phone, with outstanding features. My only complaint would be that when there are apps running, it tends to get very warm, and it shortens the battery life."
yes,no,yes,I own a Samsung Galaxy S5 and I have enjoyed using it without a problem. I needed a new phone and the Galaxy 5 was the perfect match. Both operate the same and I can use the new phone to tether the tablet. I switch between the two a lot. The phone seems to be just a smaller version of the tablet.
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely Love this phone. The camera is awesome along with all of its features. It is the only smartphone I have ever owned that was actually smart! I am 100% satisfied with this product! Great job Samsung! I look forward to owning more of your awesome products in the future!
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing. I am so much more productive with it then the other phones i have had.
yes,yes,yes,"Fast and easy to use, cool new features such as S-health."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone I especially like the fact that its water tight and durable!
yes,yes,yes,"I am a social media junky and with this awesome phone I can have all my apps; Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, Snapchat, Pinterest. It's really great that they're not third party apps. I'm also a music freak so I enjoy being able to have all the cool music apps."
no,yes,yes,"Great phone for the first 2 months ,now shuts off randomly several times a day and reboots itself.I see online many people have this issue.What's the problem Samsung ?"
yes,yes,yes,Bought this phone as a refurb. Works well with no problems.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone ever. Had 3 iphones before and thought I would never change . This phone is so much better . The iPhone has too many limits this phone is limitless. The reason I haven't gone to the s6 is because it has some limits like the iPhone such as you can't add memory and the battery isn't easily...
no,yes,no,I have never had any issues with this phone and it is built really well. I have a terrible habit of dropping my phone and I only ever cracked the screen once when it dropped face down onto a rock.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone that does everything I need and more. I love the heart rate monitor and all that s health has to offer. I've owned other brand phones and other Samsung phones in the past and out of all the phones I've used or checked out Samsung has the best
no,yes,yes,This product had me very excited at first. but after a year and a half of usage my viewpoints have changed I was sad to see after just a couple of months a significant drop in speed and smoothness throughout the ui and I believe the reason is touch wiz because if you look at the specs the phone...
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung is great and I plan on getting everything samsung. A smart TV, an NX1 camera, the next new phone, and if they have computers. 10/10 would reccomend!! And am definitely glad I made the switch from iPhone they're dank"
yes,yes,yes,"i love the phone, i have been an galaxy owner since the s2 and this is the best one so far. i just wish samsung would not have changed the usb input."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is excellent for all your school needs, especially if u want inexpensive phone with lots of features"
no,no,no,Most of the features are fine but have a major problem with connectivity. Going from dead zones to 4 bars I get a message that says not registered in network. Would drop calls while using wi-fi. Hoping to get new phone from t-mobile. If this is a problem with the s5 not sure what I'll do next
yes,yes,yes,"Personally, I like this phone better than an iPhone. Also, this phone is water resistant so I don't have to spend money for a waterproof case. Some improvements would be allowing all apps to be stored into the SD card to save space as well as improving battery life."
yes,yes,yes,"One of the best phones I've ever had. Samasung is my favorite brand I've owned a Galaxy S3, Samsung 32', Samsung Led TV, 51' Led TV, 50' Samsung Smart TV, Galaxy Tab 2, Samsung Galaxy S5 white and blue, and Samsung Galaxy Note 4, and soon Galaxy S6 Edge."
yes,yes,yes,"I have jumped along from the galaxy s lineup as soon as a new phone is released. I had an s2, s3, s4, and s5. The S5 was awesome. I don't understand why people complained about the material build being plastic when they all eventually put a plastic case to their phone as well."
yes,yes,yes,"Good, in fact excellent over all experience. camera results are out standing."
yes,yes,yes,"Has everything I need/want. Easy to use, keeps it's charge even after all day use, handles all the apps I need/want, love that it is water resistant and that I can add a chip for extra memory. I wish the camera was faster and that it came in less standard colors as far as design."
yes,no,yes,"I like the stile,colors and the most part the functions"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Only issue is charging port is hinkey.
yes,yes,yes,"Great features, love the fact that you can add a storage card to extend the storage size."

yes,yes,yes,this phone has everything that I could ask for in a device. by far the best yet. all my gadgets are made by Samsung. Nothing but the best.
yes,yes,yes,"I like how clear and easy the screen is, the camera is really good too it's got great features. I like that it doesn't have too much apps that you don't need. What I don't really like is that it's a little slow for me, and the battery drains really quickly and the over all design could have been a..."
yes,yes,yes,I'm really satisfied with the vivid colors and fast performance at the palm of your hand.
yes,yes,yes,The waterproof feature is great love it. Please bring this feature back
yes,yes,yes,This phone is excellent. And T-Mobile is an excellent carrier to provide this model.
no,yes,yes,"The S5 is the phone I would have designed if given the chance. The screen is bright, crisp and the colors are a sight for sore eyes. The battery outlasts any I have tried in the past. Storage, come on, the S5 will accept a 128Gig SD card. Just try and fill that card up."
yes,yes,yes,Made it to the top. I started long ago using the original galaxy then moved to the galaxy 2 then 3 then 4 now i have arrived. The galaxy s5 is a very nice phone and i wish i could get the 6 edge but in due time this shall happen.
no,yes,yes,The lollipop software took a good phone and turned it into junk. The update to fix the issues did nothing.
yes,yes,yes,its my first samdung phone but its my favourite. Its so fast and battery life is great. Premium design
yes,no,yes,I can't put things were I want them and some of the things on the home screen you can't remove. I liked my Galaxy 3 better.

yes,yes,yes,I switched out from the iphone and completely love the galaxy .... Much useer friendly.

yes,yes,yes,I love everything about this phone. Please buy this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely love this phone. It has everything I need and so much more. It is super easy to use and all the functions are great. Plus you can get samsung apps at your figure tips. I use it as my computer for all my business.

yes,yes,yes,"In the galaxy of galaxy devices, the S5 is truly the pinnacle of perfection. So much so that I chose it over the S6."
yes,yes,yes,This phone made my life so much easier. I used to be aN iPhone user but not anymore. I convinced my partner to switch to Samsung too. And he loves it
yes,yes,yes,"It does what I need, stands up to everyday use without issue and the battery lasts a good long time. I like this phone a LOT."
yes,yes,yes,"The camera, if your moving it says still & best pic"
no,yes,yes,For the price I would think it would mess up less. Seems to need update to fix bugs.
yes,yes,yes,"I've never owned a Samsung. Love the crisp photos it takes. Overall the Samsung apps are great. It took some getting used to since I have always owned a Sony. Overall, a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,Now the galaxy s5 the screen size is perfect for ome handed texting. There are great quality cases available for it as well. It can handle a 128gb micro SD card. Its processor is great. My favorite feature is the fingerprint scanner security without a doubt.

yes,yes,yes,I just got into the smartphone binge 2 years ago. I started with a ZTE Concord through T-Mobile. I was impressed with how it operated but I knew it had limitations. Then I got the Samsung Galaxy S4 and really was impressed with how that model worked and really got me hooked on having a smartphone.
yes,yes,yes,My Samsung is the best phone I have ever had. I much prefer this over any other android or even Iphone. The features blow my mind and just the over all build quality makes my life that much better. Whenever my friends and I talk about phones I show them mine and I become the talk of the town
yes,yes,yes,"My Galaxy is perfect, runs very smooth, has great features, amazing camera, and is easily modded. I am so excited to learn more!"
no,yes,no,sometimes when i want to call its shows i need to register.
yes,yes,yes,I love my GS5! This is my second one my first one over heated and blew the screen internally. It was a sad day. Lucky I had my Galaxy gear or else I would have been without a phone at all. One week later my replacement phone came in. Once my upgrade is available I'll be switching to the S6.
yes,yes,yes,"For the necessities like Email, Messaging, phone calls and using the Internet this phone is great!! Comes with the needed features... I haven't downloaded anything extra except for my apps."
no,yes,yes,Replaced this product 5x. Not sure if getting any phone when it first comes out is advisable. Each time I try it doesn't work out well for me. Would be an excellent phone if it would have stopped turning itself on and off randomly.
yes,yes,yes,This phone would be great if there weren't so many updates. Everything you update this phone the updates mess with the performance of the phone.
yes,no,yes,"Just about everything about the phone is great the design,the camera,and all the features it has the only problem i had with it was the the battery life it did not last long enough as other phones would but is great in my opinion."
yes,yes,yes,"Is it the sleek and sexy design?It is hard say. It is not just one, but all of these things. When you factor in the micro USB storage, removable (read replaceable) battery, and slim profile, this phone gives you no reason to upgrade.The 16 megapixel cameras enable the user to take clean, clear..."

yes,yes,yes,I'd just switch from a s4 to a s5 way better than a s4 faster phone takes great pictures would recommend to anybody
yes,yes,yes,Good phone...I think the only bad thing is it is too expensive...other than that its great
yes,yes,no,"The Galaxy S5 is my eighth cell phone and my second Galaxy (S2). The most important, as a senior, is the dependability, my call goes through everytime. It is reassuring to know that I can get help if I need it. A second important issue is using the phone."
yes,yes,yes,My husband and I have always had Samsung phone's but the galaxy s5 has done more than I could have imagined. The galaxy s5 is so comfortable and user friendly I even recommended it to my dad who ended up switching from the Iphone. I have never had a phone I loved more.

no,yes,yes,I recently traded in my iPhone 5c for the Galaxy S5 and I am very happy with my decision. I love the multi-tasking window. My only issue is group texting and emojis. Maybe I'm doing something wrong but when I try to send a group text it doesn't send properly which causes a lot of mixup.
yes,yes,yes,"I personally think that the Samsung Galaxy S5 is an amazing phone. I've owned this phone for over a year and have dropped it plenty of times and left it in bad conditions, but am yet to have a problem with any aspect of the phone!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,I currently own 4 Samsung phones and 2 tablets. Of my many phone;Galaxy S3
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, it's very fast. Easy to download and do pretty much anything on it. Lots of space. Really like the water resistant feature because it saved my phone a couple times. I love the finger scanner lock I can put on the screen, keeps everyone out of my phone."

yes,yes,yes,This phone is great. It's easy to navigate through the pages.

yes,no,yes,I have nothing but good things to say about this phone. In fact I'm very impressed with all its features and options. Major advantages (for my use) include:Some features that could use more improvement:I cannot see how one would be dissapointed from this phone.

yes,yes,yes,"S5 is a great phone that helps you do a lot in a good sized, compact phone."

yes,yes,yes,The galaxy S5 I own is amazing. It revolutionizes the phone industry. There is not way that this phone is better than any iPhone. I've tried iphone it doesn't even compare to the greatness of this phone. I would recommend this phone to anybody and everybody.

no,yes,no,I have to say that I do like the phone. The only disappointment is that the small cover for the charging port broke fairly quickly. I believe that there was a problem with it from the start since it didn't seem to close completely.
yes,yes,yes,My new phone works better than the s3 I had before. I love the speed and picture quality. The fingerprint security feature is so cool. This phone is my new best peripheral brain.
yes,yes,yes,"I've owned a lot of Samsung phones, it is my goto brand to own. The Galaxy S5 is by far the best one I've owned so far. The design is great, the value is great, the performance is great, the only thing wrong with it so far is the camera mode and the fact that everytime I move apps onto my SD card..."
yes,yes,yes,"Before I had gotten this phone I had done a ton of research on the specs, design, reviews, and overall quality of the Galaxy S5. I have to say, they were all true! I absolutely love this phone. It is an easy to use, user friendly phone which is great."
yes,yes,yes,"Simple, fast fun, easy displays great notifications"
yes,no,no,"My S 4 was a pretty beat... I liked it quite a bit, but it never made the grade for me compared to some other os options. . However, after returning a note 4 before I used it...(too big) . I had the chance to use a friend's galaxy 5. I knew I had to have one. First of all its a major speed increase."
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone for a person who has a very active/sporty lifestyle, like myself. Great processor paired with waterproofing and really great drop protection."
yes,yes,yes,"I find the Samsung galaxy S5 a good phone, with lots of good features, better than its predecessors. Performance is good, but internal memory continues to be limited. Another thing that needs work is the phone speaker. At higher volume, the phone speaker tends to rattle a little bit."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone most of the time, but sometimes i lose service, or a call and even text. and i don't get them for hours and sometimes days if at all. and the price of the phone is WAY to much for it."

yes,yes,yes,"I don't know why people buy iPhones! This phone is a really good phone for people to have because it has a great display, good battery life, and good performance. I would recommend this phone over the Galaxy S6 (even though it has a better version of android than the S5)."
no,no,yes,"This is my second S5, and it outperforms my first one by a mile! After the screen on my first S5 died (less than one year after purchasing it), and T-mobile quickly replaced it with a new S5."

yes,yes,yes,"I have watched friends get the iPhone. But I don't ever want to go without my Samsung Galaxy. It's fast, you can easily move between multiple screens. I love the fact that you get a small box for incoming calls versus taking up the entire screen."
yes,yes,yes,"Having a motorola flip-phone for the past eight years, diving into the world of widgets and apps with a smartphone was a challenge, sometimes frustrating. Although the customization options make the galaxy challenging to get hold of, the ability to personalize and be creative with the configurations..."
yes,yes,yes,The layout and design is beautifully done and everything is functional and practical
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is really fast, much improved battery life, and has a few new nifty features from my old Galaxy 5. I've had the phone for a week and still finding my through all the features and hidden features."
yes,yes,yes,Everything I can need in a phone is right here in my Samsung Galaxy S5. It offers me anything that I may need with a simple touch.
yes,yes,yes,I love samsung products because they have so much took to play around. They don't have to stick to the same design or shape and has so many features you can't get on other phones. The private mode is one of my favorite features and the awesome thing about this phone is that I've had it for almost a...
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great. I love all the features and it works really well. Just wish the screen was a little bigger. But overall I am 100% satisfied with my phone.

yes,yes,yes,"It's about time, finally I have a phone that I can say meets my needs. Not too much fluff but just enough to adequately keep me connected. It's just enough and works great not complicated to use."
yes,yes,yes,"To start, the performance of the phone is indeed optimal and very impressive, as most all higher end phones are today. Multitasking is very smooth and I never notice any freezing or lagging when running several apps at once. Playing games is also very impressive and the display is stunning."

yes,yes,yes,"This smartphone has all the features you need for casual novice to a power user business user. I was able to utilize KNOX to separate my Work life and Personal life. With the new OS Lollipop, I am able to take advantage of the new features it offers and a better lit Touchwiz UI."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought the s5 as soon as I came out and love the phone for all of its features. Now the drawbacks I have had to warranty 3 of them already for the typical overheating issue, constant crashing of apps, freezing in middle of everything but besides that phone works great."
yes,yes,yes,I was holding onto my HTC because I thought the new phones were overrated.
yes,yes,yes,I love my S5!!! It was an easy transition from my Blaze which I loved!!
yes,yes,yes,"I thought I wouldn't find a phone that liked more than my S-5 but I did. The Galaxy S-6 edge is beautiful, fast, slim and my new love. You know how you hate changing phones because you have to get it all ""set-up""."

yes,yes,yes,"I love my new Galaxy S5. The big screen makes watching videos very enjoyable, the camera is amazing, the fact that it's waterproof is a huge plus, and it's fast. It makes my life so much easier, my old phone was getting slow and glitchy and it was hard to do anything on it."
yes,yes,yes,"Received this phone as a mother's day gift. I really like this phone. The one thing I don't like about this phone is the ""My Magazine"" page. I don't use it or need it, but can't seem to get it off my phone."
yes,yes,yes,Fast powerful full of features and game's. Great pictures
yes,yes,yes,I originally didn't want an S5 I wanted the Note 4. But my parents got me the S5 on their own. I was disappointed at first but the features on the S5 made up for it completely. So I would recommend the S5 to anyone because Galaxies are better than Iphones. I give the S5 10/10 stars.
yes,yes,yes,"If you are not ready for it, it will have you discovering new features every single day. I love that its waterproof, I don't have to worry about my 2 year old dropping stuff on it."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone because it has a better camera than the phone I was using and because it was highly recommended by my nephew. The camera's quick auto-focus feature and the variety of shot modes are great--I get clear, sharp photos that I can easily text or email to friends or post on social..."

yes,yes,yes,This is it if you are looking for a tablet.. Awesome product.
yes,yes,yes,"Everything about this phone I love. The fact I can replace my battery and me or is tops. The camera has awesome quality and resolution and the built in features are powerful and in abundance. I don't need a digital cam any more. The phone itself is highly customisable with no ""jail breaking"" needed."
yes,yes,yes,It's great. With school in stuff the battery is super great. It keeps going. Also it's durable. I dropped (accidentally) it from my car at 25mph it some how didn't crack. It's tough. For the speed of the phone its excellent fast and it keeps me on track and up to date with things happening.
yes,yes,yes,the phone features are beyond my expectations. I would recommend it to all my family and friends.

yes,yes,yes,Love this phone its just the perfect size for all my kneeds
yes,yes,yes,My upgrade from a galaxy 3 to a galaxy 5 was a great choice.
yes,yes,yes,I love you this phone its been the best one so far especially the features
yes,yes,yes,"I've run through several cells over the years but the S5 wit KitKat is the best so far. I can see it in daylight, it works well with my Pebble, it's waterproof (which you don't want to need but may). Just the right size - any larger and it wouldn't work for men who put them into their front pockets."
yes,yes,yes,"Is very fast in the menus and taken pictures, the quality of photos is great. The width is fantastic. The battery life most be enhance. Is a great product"

yes,yes,yes,Its an overall great phone easy to use and navigate through. I would recommend this phone to everyone who loves to watch tv videos and can flip from page to page.
yes,yes,yes,"My S5 isn't really growing with me. It IS rather, leading me into contemporary techno-GUI awakenings as quickly as I can grasp each application. And before I can comprehend fully the useful potential of a feature, I was literally stumbling across new ones."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is amazing. I used another popular brand for years, and then tried this one and am hooked.The program features. large screen, free apps, etc. are unbeatable.My daughter and the sales clerk were right when they recommended it to me."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung always makes great product . Each generation of galaxy phones keeps getting better and better.
yes,no,yes,"I loved the s5 when i had Verizon and when we switched to T-Mobile we decided to get it again even though we could have gotten the s6 the s5 was in our price range and offered features that related to us more like a removable battery, expandable memory, and being water resistant( with a child at..."

yes,yes,yes,I have no complaints about my S5. I'm very happy with it. Samsung is the only brand phone I prefer!
yes,yes,yes,"Well, first off I must say I am quite impressed with the design improvements and quality of this edition of the galaxy. This edition of the galaxy is guite an upgrade from the S4 and leaps and bounds up from my s3."
yes,yes,yes,The only problem is that it sticks sometimes. Not enough to get another phone just annoying. Don't like the charger. It's flatter and long so none of my other charger work. Other than that.....great phone.
yes,yes,yes,Ive had an issue with the Multi window option not having an access tab to drag features back and forth. I have to select multi window off and on every single time I want to use it. But I like the phone over all. I will always use Samsung!
yes,yes,yes,This is one of the best phones I have ever owned. Now all I do is swear by Samsung products
yes,no,yes,"IF you own an S5 DO NOT UPGRADE TO lollipop OS, it will break everything. My S5 used to take great photos now, the camera crashes all the time. My wife has an S4 and its taking better photos than the S5. The contacts keeps on crashing. Calling Tmobile to see if i can go back to the old OS."
yes,yes,yes,Operates pretty swiftly. Videos and pics very clear! Satisfied!. Nice size too
yes,yes,yes,"I'm not super techy but my husband and son are. I told them I needed something easy to use with a good camera. This is what they, more soy son came up with & as a mom, I went for it."

no,no,no,"I have to dial a 1 for each of my contacts, my hotspot and tether don't work well at all and cuts me off when I just finally hook up and it wasn't the phone that I had stolen from my van , because I had a note 3 and they sent me this phone which is smaller so my terrible eyesight don't go well with..."

yes,yes,yes,I love this phone and wish I had gotten it A LOT sooner than I did.
no,no,no,"I bought this phone to replace a Samsung Galaxy Discover. It routinely made me so upset that I wanted to throw it. The call quality was awful, with people often not understanding what I was saying and apps, including apps to access the internet, were unusable slow when they didn't crash outright."
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone that has all the options that I need. The screen is just big enough without being too large to carry in my pocket. Great graphics and functionality. I love the Health option. It's nice to see how many steps I take in a day. I have no complaints with this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"This being the first smart phone I've owned. It's been great. I've learned a lot. This phone has done everything that I wanted, and I am learning more. Great phone."
yes,no,yes,"I bought this phone because i got everything in it specially health management and Camera as good as a DSLR camera.Very light weight, excellent battery power management, hardware performance etc."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, love it fantastic new features recommend."
yes,yes,yes,Love it!!!! The heart monitor and the daily step count has really helped improve my health.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is overall good. Great apps, easy to install and setup, good grouping and allows you to group your preference. Battery too weak however as it runs down quickly if you use all the bells and whistles. It's a little too big for my liking though others may find that a plus."
yes,yes,yes,Wonderful phone. Best I've had so far. Love it. I recommend it.
yes,yes,yes,The phone has great features. I like that it is waterproof.
yes,no,yes,"I always buy galaxy smartphones (this is my 3rd) because I'm just used to them, but every time I upgrade I keep hoping they'll be better only to find out its much of the same."
yes,yes,yes,"In one sentence; as always the right choice, excellent!"
yes,yes,yes,"Battery last longer than other Samsung phones. It's easy to use, fast and durable. Love the smart case with the screen view."

yes,yes,yes,I love this phone sorry I didn't get it sooner but I have it now
yes,yes,yes,This is my 2nd Samsung phone and I have not been disappointed. I have found the Samsung phones to be very well built and reliable. My older phone was passed on but still working good. I have been very pleased with this purchase.
yes,no,yes,"Excellent Poone, overall. Great design, performance, and user-frendliness. Battery life is good to start with. Durability yet to be tested."
yes,yes,yes,I like my galaxy s5 its the best phone I ever had.
yes,yes,yes,Love Samsung products but I have found problems with overheating on the G4 & G5.
yes,no,yes,"I cannot say how disappointed I am that Samsung chose not to take advantage of camera2 in android 5. I am a photographer and was planning on using the Galaxy S5 as a backup camera. I only shoot in raw... again, I am EXTREMELY disappointed with Samsung"
yes,yes,yes,This phone has great features and is easy to use. The camera takes great pics. It's easy to connect to other devices.
yes,yes,yes,The samsung galaxy s 5 is one of the best phones I've ever had with features and performance it is really great
no,no,yes,overall I like the phone and the features. But my battery does not last very long anymore and the charger door will not stay shut. Battery will not charge on my mobile charger.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung is always on top of game.....Ive always owned a s as msung phone \u2026
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased a cover for peace of mind. The phone overheated.Most times , I have Wi-fi, location, sync, and bluetooth off in an attempt to prolong the battery life. That shouldn't have to be.I have had better Samsung products in the past. This one, I didn't buy at first.."
yes,yes,yes,The Camara is not that good. I think the galaxy 3 had THE BEST CAMARA
no,no,no,My S5 is much slower then my S3 and freezes way more. It seems like the entire experience is choppier from typing text to browsing Im still with the same carrier so it's unlikely that it's the network and I doubt there's any damages to the phone because its been this way since the first day I bought...
yes,yes,yes,Definitely love the phone works great many features and durable ;)
yes,yes,yes,"I couldn't WAIT to get the S5 and I'm still glad I did!! Great phone, plenty of space, and it's light!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I've personally never kept interest in a phone for so long without wanting a new one. Even when I begin flirting with the idea of trying an iPhone (I've never had one), I always realize how easier I have it with Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I ever owned I don't even want to upgrade for the 6.. I mean I do but I want to stay with this one for ever.... words can't explain how much this phone can do for you...
yes,yes,yes,"There is a lot on this phone for people, like me, who uses there phone for every thing. There is only one or two things I wish it had and that is the extra volume button and noise reduction that the 4 had."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone so far.the more you use it, the more you see it can do."
yes,yes,yes,"The wife and I needed new phones, she wanted a bigger screen and better camera, so we decided to leave the fruit behind and move back to Android. Our choice of the S5 was a good one. The camera is great, she loves it and the screen is bigger, clearer and everything just looks great on it."
yes,yes,yes,"I am not an apple person, so I do not wait for the latest iphone to come out and go crazy for it. But this galaxy is a different story. I had the S3 and gave it to my son so I could get the S5. I have enjoyed this phone more and still find stuff on it all the time."
yes,yes,yes,"Well thank you Samsung, I was late for work this morning. This new update ( Lollipop ) has really messed me up with the Alarm, Interruptions and Priority. It has gotten far more confusing than it needs to be. Let me just ask you a simple question."
yes,no,yes,"After having iPhones for a while, I'm so glad to have the s5 now. Better technology, better performance, better experience. The only improvement I would request is for a fingerprint scanner that doesn't require a swipe."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm still learning the features of my phone, but so far I love it."
yes,yes,yes,The S5 is a great device. I love the display and camera. The battery and performance could be a bit better though. The design would be much better if the frame wasn't plastic and ruffled. Other than those minor flaws it's a great device.
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone. There is an App I had to give up up. I got the 16 GB phone, and space is a little tight. It is fast and works great. Has been dropped in water and still keeps ticking. That is the reason I go the phone. I wanted durability. Got to love it."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome !!! Love this product !!! I really enjoy all the features !! And have told my family and friends as well !!
yes,yes,yes,I went from a galaxy 2 to a 5s and I love it. And I would recommend this phone to anyone. Thanks
yes,yes,yes,"When I first got this phone i loved it, but I did a recent update to the lollipop software and was very upset, some of the features are great but to make the silent option something like all or nothing is not fair to the consumer."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung S 5 has great coverage and capacity to take all the Apps I frequently use. The screen resolution is the best I have had yet and the S 5's camera capabilities are great.
yes,yes,yes,I can't believe how easy my tv computer and phone link easily
no,yes,no,I really like this phone. But if used for some time it starts to heat up. Screen gets extremely hot. Also with that then battery timing start to decrease. I sometime have to charge more than 3 times in a day. Software need to be modified.
yes,yes,yes,"As a former diehard BlackBerry user, I wasn't sure how things would work out on a totally new OS. Needless to say, I am very happy with my T-Mobile service using this Galaxy S5. The device is very responsive and easy to navigate. Hopefully the new Lollipop OS will bring an even better experience."
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from a SIII to the S5 and i love it, from the bigger screen, to the water proof covering and it has a great camera. The smart switch was a plus also so i didnt lose any of my data!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. It has in internal remote control, 4k camera, fingerprint security, nfc, screen mirroring, multi-windows for multitasking two apps simultaneously, and is pretty fast. The battery life isn't as great as I've read about, but maybe that's because my battery might be defective."
yes,no,no,"I rarely get this excited about anything that deals with electronics. But I must admit from the first time is saw the screen turn on to now, the resolution is beyond anything I have seen out there. Even with its' size, it is surprisingly lightweight."
yes,yes,yes,I just love the thrill before each coming up .... and I don't get discouraged. This Samsung is nothing but great! Nothing to do with the limited device of iphone!!!!
yes,yes,yes,Helps with business life and more great phone. Excellent for apps and keeping up with everything even use my to process payments and do invoicing for my personal business.
yes,yes,yes,i had da galaxy s4. n dan I upgraded to da s5 which was amazing choice I made. I went into the lake with it and took vedio underwater dat came out clear. that's one of the features I luv about the phone
yes,yes,yes,"I had iphones, but nothing Compares to the s5. The design the freedom you can do. I would trade any other phones to get and keep the s5"
yes,yes,yes,"Had the S4, but due to my carelessness, needed an upgrade. Went with the s5. Love it. Everything I loved about my S4, plus some. Def the best phone on the market IMHO."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone as expected from Samsung, lots of great features and connectivity to other Samsung products."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone does it all, just got to learn all the features."
yes,no,yes,"the only problem I had is the cover for the charging port. I noticed when I first got it that it's kind of flimsy. Well, despite trying to be careful whenever I charged the phone, it finally broke off. Needless to say it negates the ""water resistance"" feature of the phone. Minor problem though."
yes,no,yes,"I have had the Samsung Galaxy S5 for the last 6 months, and I am thoroughly impressed! Waterproof and dustproof, all I added was a simple case and screen protector, and it's pretty much indestructible now. The performance is wonderful, experiencing no lag when I am running multiple apps."
yes,yes,yes,Better than iPhone 6. Bought iPhone aand returNed it after week not as good as this phone . This phone is eas to work with
yes,yes,yes,I had Prism 2 phone before. Switched to Galaxy S5. HUGE difference.

yes,yes,yes,Cant wait till the 6 edition comes out. Thanks for the great products Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,"This is the first Galaxy I have ever owned and it is by far my favorite phone I have ever had! I have had several different Samsung cell phones in the past and the have always been a good quality phone, but my S5 has blown my mind at how well it was made."
yes,yes,yes,S5 IS JUST AN AWESOME phone.
yes,yes,yes,Purchased for me and my son. Love the Galaxy S5. Only issue that seems to not be able to be resolved is that my son's screen will shutoff (saving battery) but mine will not fade to black. It will stay on as if I am continuously using it. Other is the calendar doesn't sync
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy S5 Phone is a Very Good Product with Kitkat Android OS (4.4.2) upgradable to Android OS Lollipop (5.0). Rear End Camera is too good with 16 MP. The photos are awesome. Light Weight phone with great UI. Love this Phone!
yes,yes,yes,I just love this phone. Awesome features good deal.
yes,yes,yes,"Great touch interface, and battery life is excellent when idle and good when in use (large screen consumes most of the power).I wish the keyboard had arrow keys on it. Also, the built-in weather app needs an hourly and a 10-day view."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my second Samsung phone. I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S Blaze to the Galaxy S5, so of course there was a tremendous improvement. The speed is amazing and the quality is outstanding. I'm truly enjoying this phone."
no,yes,no,"over all the phone is a great product. unfortunately, the battery life is bad. had the phone 6 months and it will not last a day. reset to factory setting and will see if that helps. will let you know how it works."
yes,yes,yes,"BEST EVER PHONE, DOES IT ALL AND BLOWS APPLE OUT OF THE WATER FOR DESIGN AND UP TO DATE TECH."
yes,yes,yes,"When opening the box you can just tell you picked the right phone. Coming from a Nexus 5, I experienced some brilliant changes but unfortunately some very minor ones too. It's hard to start out with what I liked best about the phone because there is just too much."
yes,yes,yes,Couldn't be happier with this device .Many of my friends have I Phone 6 . this device seems to be better than IPhone .I'm still trying to use all of the features and it's awesome .
yes,no,yes,The restrictions on the SD card really needs to be addressed. It makes the extended memory worthless. I considered the amount memory to be one of the key attractions.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone make me trust in Samsung again. I almost change to iphone, because i have bad experience with Galaxy S3. But Galaxy S5 is awesome, very fast and very easy to use. Camera is very nice and clear, the wifi is tremendous. If a Galaxy S6 is on the way i will buy it."
yes,yes,yes,this is my third samsung phone in last 10 years and it's a big step from the Samsung Galaxy s3 that I had. I've tried other models from different makers none of them compare to the Samsung phones. I love this phone everything about it.
yes,yes,yes,Went from the S2 to the S5 big difference. I'm enjoying the change. I like that it's water proof to a degree. Like that you can add additional screens or tiles not sure proper name. Samsung makes a great product
no,yes,no,I've had this phone for 2 maybe 3 months now I absolutely loved it when I 1st got it but now its extremely slow I clear my memory and restart my phone daily and I will have either full service bars or full WiFi bars and my phone still won't load anything there's times I have to take my battery out...
yes,yes,yes,Had an iPhone before s5 is much better than the iPhone.

yes,yes,yes,"So far this phone is amazing I had the S4 and by comparison this is is great, the design the new features and everything that it offees. Of course al this is after you get used to it since it has different ways from the S4"
yes,yes,yes,Way better than the iphone. And not having to go through iTunes is awesome
yes,yes,yes,"I loved my s3 and avoided the upgrade until it fell and broke the third time....so I got a great case and the s5. Blows me away how well they improved a great phone without bloating it down with uselees features. Great phone, Great Design And Tons of fun To use. Battery is way better as well."
yes,yes,yes,"fantastic product, love all the features and specs, only some times it restarts by itself, and love the desing just wish they would of done a aluminum back version. LOVE IT!"
yes,no,yes,This phone is worth it just for the camera alone...its fantastic. But it also comes with other good stuff too!
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing. ..cool features, great style, awesome performance, all around great phone! I love the wi-fi calling features and the kids mode app. Give the lil one something to do while driving."
yes,yes,yes,"There is no way you can pry me away from my phone.The functionality of this phone is amazing! I thought the Galaxy S4 was awesome, however, this phone just blows me away!The battery life is great (I don't have to carry my charger to work anymore) and yes I run a ton of applications daily.The picture..."
no,no,yes,"I'm a Galaxy guy. This is my third from Samsung. I am a hair away from getting an iPhone 6 instead. The Car Mode function is the primary culprit. When I climb into my car, and the phone connects via bluetooth, I am able to play music and take calls through my car speakers, which is lovely."
yes,no,yes,I love this phone it is a power house my only complaint would be the initial battry life I would go from full charge to 50% just on my way to work but with a zerolemon 8500 mah battery and case I have no problem going an entire day on one charge hopefully in the future this might be a adressed I...
yes,yes,yes,Love the new 5. Have had the G3 and G4 and couple minis. I do miss the back bottom. Bad idea changing that on us. Second day I rooted my phone so got rid of a lot if bloat ware. Installed my own stuff and works great . Strong phonenough. Best on market I say..Mooney
yes,yes,yes,Has a lot of options and fetures. I have not figured out how to use everything but I'm learning everyday. Very glad I choose this phone.

no,no,yes,"The processor is able to execute multiple apps with ease, and no drag or hanging. Maybe a good improvement to play songs from YouTube with the screen off, it drains the battery fast. The GPS too drains fast. Overall, it's a good phone."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Love almost everything. The music widget on the lock screen is the best I've seen so far. I am coming from a Droid razor Maxx HD and an LG g2. But with that said two major drawbacks exist. One non major one the gallery of photos runs so slow.
yes,yes,yes,"Love th u s phone, best thing about it us the am bout of pics it holds the quality of pics it takes and the video, not to mention the collage studio, I I had to give as con it would be there us no three way calling but other wise a very solid product"

yes,yes,yes,I've had it for several months now and can't believe it. I learn something new each day. It's just great. I have people tell me I should get a new iphone. Why would I want to downgrade. This beats iPhone all to pieces.

yes,yes,yes,This phone is the best it's my second one the first is still working great just stepped up to s5 love it.
yes,yes,yes,First thanks to Samsung For always caring for their customers and putting our interest first.
yes,yes,yes,I discovered yesterday that I cannot save documents from my word processing app to my micro SD card. Who's idea is this? I'm on the verge of selling this device and going back to the new BlackBerry.

yes,yes,yes,"I love love love my s5! At this I love all the functionality and size of it, way to go Samsung! I rated the performance a 4 because in the last few days it seems like that battery runs out fast, but overall it's the most awesome phone I've had!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great I would definitely recommend it!
yes,yes,yes,"I can not rave about Samsung Galaxy phones enough. I use to have the 2 and recently upgraded to the 5, and am so happy with the results. Was so easy to connect existing accounts and apps to the phone because of being connected to Google."

yes,yes,yes,I'm still learning about my new phone. So far it's a great phone that allows me to do everything that I can do on my desktop computer.
yes,yes,yes,"This by far is the best phone I have ever owned. The battery life is out if this world, I can go 2 days if I wanted without charging.

yes,no,yes,In a world where you expect to get what you pay for the Galaxy S-5 definitely delivers. A large vibrant screen gives you plenty of space to view emails and browse the internet. The S-5 exterior speaker is finally loud enough to hear what is going on without the use of headphones.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is better than all 5 of the iPhone I've ever owen.
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone very fast, loving the fitness program and heart rate monitor. Very slim and esay to carry. Love that they added waterproof. Sound quality is outstanding and camera is the best quality."

yes,yes,yes,Takes very realistic color images and videos; features are user friendly; meets all my needs without any challenges.

no,yes,yes,"And the answer (drum roll please), Samsung is running away from the competition. Not that they can't hang, it's that the other guy is not able to stay on the same page. Maybe not even the same book. Yes Samsung, my hat is off to you, you just keep getting better. Thanks!"

yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy 5 is an awesome phone. Its sleek design is comfortable and light. The best feature to me is the power save mode. Heres a trick if you want your phone to charge faster, enable the power save mode, in no time you'll be at 100% battery."

yes,yes,yes,With all features that the Samsung Galaxy S 5 can offer you I wont ask much...

yes,yes,yes,Great phone. It lacks a spotlight like all app contact search. The speakers on the back not to crazy about that. Ringer is to low. Everything else is amazing.

yes,yes,yes,"I was very uneducated on the Android market topic up until Samsung released the s4. By this point I was exhausted of apple products and needed a change for the better. Now with my galaxy s5 and all of its easily featured technologies, I'm able do everything I need to do and want to do from just this..."
yes,yes,yes,I've had my phone for 3 months now and I'm still finding new things on it. I just wish the voice recognition work better
yes,yes,yes,Nice Product I love the camera. Seems faster than my last phone & I like that is water proof.
yes,yes,yes,"Light, waterproof, loaded with features. Overall the galaxy range has been about packing Ina lot of features. Some more attention could've been paid to builtin speakers (not loud enough), In call volume (some of the noise cancellation is impressive though), camera stabilization(need to hold it..."

yes,yes,yes,Awesome product love the screen size and resolution
yes,yes,yes,It's an awesome phone. The best thing I liked about the phone is the battery life. We went mountain biking last week. I used the RunKeeper apps and music at the same time and I'm still have 55% while my buddies IPhones are dead.

yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy S5 is great phone why because is easy to use and because is waterproof it been proven
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone a couple months ago. I haven't really had any problems with any of the software. It's just the phone itself could be better built. The cheap plastic chrome piece around the phone chips easily.
no,yes,yes,"I had a Samsung Galaxy S4 before this phone, and the S4 didn't bug and glitch half as often as this phone. The buttons seemed easier to locate and there was a lot more customization options on the S4 (such as Air view and the lockscreen)."
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S5 has been great so far. The camera is the best feature and has great resolution and color, but the features are not that user friendly. The letter buttons on the keyboard are smaller than I would like and it is difficult to type at times. However, this is an excellent phone overall."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great. Its probably the best phone I had in my whole life. I always had mid range to low ranged devices all my life & to go to this is a big upgrade. The screen is really good, the performance is seem less . It handles whatever I throw at it with out breaking a sweat."
yes,yes,yes,galaxy s5 is by far the best phone i've ever had i had iphones and androids and Samsung phones last longer they are more durable and preform better. they also have more cases and accessory such as life proof case and the watch. i don't plan on switching phones in awhile.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! There are many features I have yet to discover or use. That's what I love about it. My only complaint would be the new recent apps button. I don't care for it too much. Overall the phone is impressive. The camera is crystal clear. I love it!
no,yes,yes,Despite the quality of the design the touch wiz interface is lack luster and Troublesome to use on a day to day basis. It seems as though the UI has no pep in its step as the animations and even some applications fail to work as they should.
yes,yes,yes,"Love it, amazing camera. Picture quality is impeccable. I was completely amazed. Not to mention the tech. The fingerprint scanner amazing"
yes,yes,yes,S5 is the best phone it does everything I haven't touch my computer in months.I like it very much.
yes,yes,yes,The software runs great zero lag! Colors jump off the screen an you'll love how fast the phone is especially the great camera an apps!
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is everything I hoped the S4 was at the time of my purchase. I love the feel of it in my hand and I find myself using 90% of all functions, which are great. However, I do wish the build quality was still just slightly better."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone! The performance, apps and battery life all are so excellent. I'm new to using SHEALTH and love it. Love the feature of being able to unlock your phone with the scan of your finger print. Lookout Mobile Security came with my phone, works in the background and doesn't slow it down."
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had my SG5 since mid July, but I love it. Great features and fairly easy to use. I'm terrible about reading instructions, but this phone makes things easy to figure out. I love the Data Usage app. I told my sister so much about the phone, she decided to get one."

no,no,yes,"Let me start by saying that I am the kind of the person that keeps their phone for several years before switching it out with another. With that being said, a durable phone that will consistently deliver all necessary functions is of critical importance to me."

yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, hasnt failed me yet. Great quality!"

Once I got familiar with the new operating system and the workings of the Galaxy S5, I don't think there is anything that I..."
yes,yes,yes,Love my GS5. Always telling friends to get Samsung products. Ended up getting some of my friends to get Samsung for their new phones
yes,yes,yes,I am mainly happy with my phone & the features that it has...my only problem is that it tells me my battery is overheated if I'm on it for very long at a time...other than that I'm happy with it.
yes,yes,yes,"I really don't know what else you can make a phone do. I don't ever use my tablet anymore at all you store anything in this phone and still have room for more. I recently owned the note 3, and that is an awesome phone as well, but when I picked up the s5, it was perfect to the touch and I couldn't..."
yes,yes,yes,The only thing i didn't like about the phone was it didn't have a menu button i couldn't use some apps because if that reason other than that great phone
yes,yes,yes,"I have been using Samsung phone for the 2nd time, started off with the galaxy 4 and now with the best phone in the market s5."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung galaxy 5 was exactly how it was advertise. Durable and light weight. It has a great features compare other phone.
yes,yes,yes,I like it. I don't think it is perfect though. I like the big screen but I don't like to carry it around. It is a big phone with a big screen and it is what it is. Sometimes it seems a little jumpy about things but I think I can adjust that out of it in motion control.
yes,yes,yes,"As a former user of all things iPhone (Generation 1 to iPhone 5), I finally made 'the switch' last week (8/9/2014). In the matter of a few days I have realized 2 quintessential things:1. Samsung got it rightI simply can't put my Galaxy S5 down."

yes,yes,yes,the only problem with the phone is the battery life I wish I was a little bit longer
yes,no,yes,"The location of volume control keys is very easy to be pressed when I try to press the power key and using one hand.The USB cover is poor design too. It is so hard to open if I use my finger. I have to find something hard, flat and thin to open the USB cover."
yes,yes,yes,HDR mode and Smooth motion features are really useful
yes,yes,yes,"I been an iPhone guy for the last 5 years, was not to thrill about the Galaxy line, after using the S5 for the last month and half I am impress with the overall performance and quality of this device. I was considering change it when the new iPhone 6 comes out, I don't think I will."

yes,yes,yes,"I am Very Satisfied with the Galaxy S5. Does everything I need. Ultra power saving mode is great, I don't have to worry about being near a power outlet at all times."
yes,yes,yes,"I like my S5. The only reason I did not give a rating of 5 on the features is that they have removed the ""Menu"" button for the device. This was one of the reasons that I did not like I-Phone. The other 4 is for value, I feel it could have been priced slightly lower."

yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galazy S5 is a good highly featured phone. The battery last 2 to 3 days with moderate use. The phone connects well to memorized WiFi sources and the bluetooth works well. The only design flaw is the external ""Home"" button at the bottom of the screen."
yes,yes,yes,The features are great and respond really fast. It would be better if it came with an app to video chat instead of downloading other apps ourselves like something standard. The only bad thing is that it can be more impact resistant or made with a bit more heavy duty exterior.
yes,yes,yes,"For the couple of months that I have had this phone, I have been impressed over and over again by it performance. I love the fact that the phone does really well while running multiple applications. The screen size is perfect and has made reading books very enjoyable."
yes,yes,yes,"At first I was a bit skeptical about switching form the iPhone 5S, but I am very happy that I did.Main reasons why I switched:Dislikes:"
yes,yes,yes,This Devices is amazing. Light to hold in your hands and just enough power to pull through the day and all your apps. From its amazing quad core processor to its shimmering display this is anything but a normal tab.

yes,yes,yes,This is by far the best phone/mini computer I've ever had. I do a lot with this phone from paying bills to watching video's. The camera takes great pictures and the overall performance of the phone is great. I'm sure I have yet to use everything this phone had to offer. .
yes,yes,yes,"The picture and video quality are superior. I can't tell you how many compliments I've received on videos I've taken with my phone. My friends with iPhones always comment on how big my phone is, but then when they see the screen and video capability and quickly go silent."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung should know when they are making power full device it's gonna need more juice in battery I hate battery runs out because of same reason I moved from iPhone 5 to Samsung this wort experience I had with Samsung they do something about it.
yes,yes,yes,This is my 1st Samsung phone & I must say I'am enjoyn it to the fullest. it's everything my friends said it was.
yes,yes,yes,I really love Samsung products so I brought this phone because I saw the specs in it. Such as the 16mp camera. That actually works perfectly. The only minor problems that this phone has (which most Samsung phones have) is that the keyboard sometimes fixes to another app.

yes,yes,yes,This phone is fast and clear. I have no complaints at all and it is so much better than my last phone. I am amazed at how well it works with my apps and media.
yes,yes,yes,"I have had my new Samsung Galaxy S5 for about 4 weeks now. My main concern when purchasing a phone was space/memory. This phone is GREAT for space!! I love how I am able to have so many apps available and still be able to hold pictures, music, etc."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love the phone.Has great features. Easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,+ I like that the back (battery cover) is matte and a bit rubbery. It helps keep it where I put it and it feels good to hold. I also hated that the GS4 collected fingerprints back there.Two part:- It's unfortunate that it doesn't have a dedicated graphics
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, very practical but, I think Samsung app like the calendar, task could be improved,"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is everything you could want in a mobile device
yes,yes,yes,I like it is the best of all that other products thanks samsung.

yes,no,yes,"Words cant even describe how awesome this Samsung Galaxy S 5 gphone is, I've had it for only one month now and I was so impressed with it that I went out to the local T-mobile Kiosk store and purchased three more for my entire family."
yes,yes,yes,I've had such a great experience with this phone. It has way more than one person needs but why not. You only live once.
yes,yes,yes,"Before having this phone, I would have to deal with phones damaging from a single fall or just a little sprinkle of water, but not this phone. What really wowed me was the versatility of this phone (I can access many features and all in an breeze) with speed."
yes,yes,yes,I have had the Galaxy S5 for a few months now. I have had no issues. The phone is fast and allows me to do what I need to do when I need to do it. There are lots of features such as the fingerprint scanner that make the phone more secure and easier to use. I love the waterproof design and the size.

yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, extremely fast. I have a note 3 too, in as much as I love the note, I found the s5 to be at least 30% faster and better in the overall graphics. I love the battery saving option where your phone can stay days on a full charge..."

yes,yes,yes,I have had a lot of phones but this phone is unbelievable so many features and so easy to use
yes,yes,yes,"This phone allows me to do so much. The battery lasts a long time, it takes amazing pictures and videos, and I love the sleek design."

yes,yes,yes,"Great screen resolution, built strong, and the fastest phone I've ever had."
yes,yes,yes,I am a fan of Samsung. I started with the galaxy 3 then the 4 and now the 5 and each phone is better than the next although I wasn't real big on changing the buttons on the bottom of the 5. Other than that it is an awesome phone
yes,yes,yes,"I owned the Samsung Galaxy S 2 and used Samsung Galaxy 3 for work. I upgraded to the 5 this year. I love this phone. I am able to search the web, it is small enough to carry, and big enough to read books or articles. It has definitely been a good investment."
yes,yes,yes,I was worried about it being big but it has not been a problem. It has been incredible. I have had no issues. It does whatever you ask it pretty much flawlessly. If there was a mini with same specs I would probably get it but this has been the best electronic device I have ever owned.
yes,yes,yes,"Nothing can compare with samsung galaxy 5 for this time , samsung always have a briliant idea to create gadgets that any compititors can't beat you down , keep on your good work samsung!! ,"

yes,yes,yes,"The S5 has awesome features, easy to navigate and makes one stands out with beautiful picture qualities."
yes,yes,yes,"its water resistant, what other top phone on the market can say that?

yes,yes,yes,I really like samsung. It has a lot of great features that Iphone doesn't.
yes,yes,yes,The cost of a smart phone is CRAZY high...but what can one do???
yes,yes,yes,I have had all of the galaxy series phones and this s.5 is by far the best it works great the water proof feature is a must these days...only thing I don't like is when trying to make a call from a number you found online it says contacts had stopped but that is only problem I have had with it..
yes,yes,yes,"Easy to use, reliable and after a few months still discovering fun and interesting things about the phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"I really love my Galaxy s5. I was always an iPhone user until I got tired of the OS issues, so switching to the new Galaxy was a good thing. My issues with this phone are only with the provider (T-Mobile) and not the phone itself. I highly recommend this phone if you want ease of use & style."
yes,yes,yes,"After going kicking and screaming into the world of smart phones, I got one because it would lower the monthly cell phone bill for my son who pays it (promotions, credits, etc.). I am pretty computer savvy but find smart phones don't always follow my computer instincts."
yes,yes,yes,"I had the Galaxy S4 and now the S5 personally I like the S4 better. Is a great phone with lots of features, just wish they keep some of the old ones."
yes,yes,yes,The phone has great features from Ultra Power Saving Mode to Camera features. The camera is definitely an amazing improvement. I would highly recommend this phone as it has great battery life and almost no lag.
yes,yes,yes,"Couldn't ask for a better phone, exception being the keyboard.... keys are tiny! Big hands like mine confuse it constantly"
yes,yes,yes,"This is by far the best galaxy phone I have ever used!

yes,yes,yes,Has a lot of useful features. Runs processes fast and has a sleek design.
yes,yes,yes,"In very proud to say I own this phone, it is a very powerful phone though it May have some set backs nothing has ever been so bad that I had to take it back."
yes,no,yes,This phone was the second Samsung phone I have had. Surprised by the speed and capabilities of this phone. When I call someone I feel assured that my phone call is not going to cut off before I intended
no,no,no,This design is so bad because the cover can brakes so easily.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone overall but at times TouchWiz just lags too much and to get the most out of the phone it really needs rooted.
no,no,no,My only problem is that it doesn't hold a charge long.
yes,yes,yes,I love this product and a great camera security system
yes,yes,yes,The galaxy s5 is a great phone. I am able to do so much on it. And all the start up apps are excellent.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is a great phone and functions as advertised
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Easy to use. Large screen. Capabilities are endless. Does seem to freeze occasionally due to certain program incompatibilies.
yes,yes,yes,"It could have been better. Maybe s6 will be much better but for noe, I will give the s5 a 2.5 on a scale of 5."
no,yes,no,This phone is NOT water resistant so I'm not sure why it markets itself to be as that simply leads you to use as advertised and end up with a dead phone. Also disappointed in the charger cover... It broke within a week. I like the concept of the phone but simply doesn't measure up.
no,no,yes,So many wonderful features. There are a lot of pros that I can think of but I want to focus on the only con that is a big one to me. The Bluetooth sound/calling feature is really buggy and cuts out a lot. I guess google has a list of people needing help trying to fix it.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy s5 for the the best phone i ever owned!
yes,yes,yes,"I found this a great cell phone. I am able to read mYour Bible, as well as website searches, text and emails make calls without dropped calls. The camera takes lovely pictures also."

yes,yes,yes,"I love my GS5! The camera is AWESOME! Once I established my Samsung account, registering my product was a breeze. I called tech support only to confirm that I had completed my registration. I will be learning more about my phone in the next few days."
yes,no,yes,Seen i am a older person Its easy to see and read application.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone and it's performance. However, I HATE THAT FREAKING LITTLE DOOR!"
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone and everything it offers to a not so techy guy. Bright screen, able to handle sunlight without the blank screen you sometimes get on sunny days. Easy to grasp all the apps/functions in no time at all. Speakers work well for calls and music."
yes,yes,yes,I have only had to give my phone to my kid once and I use it now every day. It's great!
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has an amazing camera, touch screen, keyboard, and for the fact that it's water proof and dust proof with such a slim design. It slides in my pocket easy and it easily comes out instead of it being a hassle this phone has a steep price but I think it's worth it"
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, as an IT person I've used a number of phones over the years and this one is great. It's a decent size, takes nice pictures, performance is pretty good. Samsung installed a number of nice phones on top of the existing Android KitKat features.The only issue I've had is a program..."
yes,yes,yes,"great phone, poor external speaker, needs a bump from 2gb internal memory to 3+. always running at 90+ memory usage with under 10 extra apps installed. no games or memory hogs. aside from that, still one of the best phones on the market."
yes,yes,yes,"Love the Samsung 5 light, fast, slim nice camera love it"
yes,yes,yes,"Switched from a Galaxy S4 to a Galaxy S5. Love the new ultra battery mode, the camera and video options are so much better. can do so much more than before. Its a great phone to have."
yes,yes,yes,I have had my new Samsung for a few weeks now. I love it. Battery life is no longer an issue for me. The screen size is perfect for reading with out having to enlarge the text. I am very happy with the purchase except for the cost. Phone was way to expensive. Still the best phone so I paid the cost.
yes,yes,yes,This is by far the best phone that I have ever owned. I love the features and everything is so easy to use. The camera is second to none.
no,yes,no,"For the amount of $ this phone is a nice phone and is it worth the money? NO not by a long shot! The fact that the battery life is horrible, I just took my phone off the charger while it was off and at 100% I turn it on I do this and bam 95%."
no,yes,no,"My s5 restarted 3 times, after i bought it not enough 1 month"
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy S5 is such a amazing phone. Easy switch from iphone.
yes,yes,yes,"When I bought this phone, I didn't know that it would do everything my laptop does, and better. It's faster, and doesn't heat up. I'm still learning how to better use it. I find something new everyday. I love my phone."
yes,yes,yes,"My favorite feature in this phone is the water resistance up to a meter of water. Next is the active workout app which takes your steps, heart rate, and your diet (optinial) Lastly this phone has a durable feel to it and the display is crisp as can be. Overall I love this phone"
yes,yes,yes,"My first smart phone. I bought it for the camera, and boy am I impressed. I think the pix I get are as good as many professional cameras, and I have so much more versatility. My whole family loves this phone. I have only had it for two weeks, and there is much still to learn."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. Great screen , features, and camera. The battery is absolutely great. I use the phone a lot and still only charge it MAYBE once in a 24 hour period. Plus if you find yourself with really low battery life, you can use ultra battery saver mode - I forgot to charge one day and went..."
no,yes,yes,"Love everything about this phone except one issue which is the network keeps going off and on. It's upsetting when you're trying to work online and it keeps going out, especially for the price of the phone, this shouldn't be happening at all!"
yes,yes,yes,I really like it. The Galaxy S5 tops any phone I ever had. it's a computer in your pocket.
yes,no,no,The Gal S 5 is the first phone I have owned that truly is a computer and performs like one. No lag time. No buffer time. Resolution is spectacular. Most SLRs do not rival the 16 mpx camera on this bad boy !!!
yes,yes,yes,"GREAT phone. Easy to use, ( I am not a smart phone veteran), great sound and display, terrific features, solid build! I give this phone an unqualified recommendation!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone itself is great. The features and power of the phone make it a wonderful mobile communication device. The Samsung website, however, is non-responsive, uncooperative and basically very unpleasant."
yes,yes,yes,I have owned a few smart phones a d this is the best phone I have owned yet.
yes,yes,yes,ALL I COULD SAY THIS PHONE IS AWSOME AND I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT TO OTHERS!
yes,yes,yes,Samsung always builds good products. This phone is amazing. The size is awesome and the touchscreen is amazing as well. Never got glitches and the phone is really fast. Only thing that annoys me is the charging port since it has less room to open and I don't have long nails so i need to always find...
yes,yes,yes,"I was looking forward to the debut of this phone so that I could upgrade, Bought the phone and realized that the applications that I used the most on Galaxy S 2 were missing from this phone and that it does not communicate completely with any Bluetooth head sets."
yes,yes,yes,"Waterproofed would be a given.Great screen. Decent size, and feels nice in hand.The fact the TouchWiz interface dose a dark black or navy blue background, and white text for part of its interface is awesome. Why not all that way as an option?"
yes,yes,yes,"My Son owns one, I own one, now I am going to talk my daughter into upgrading from her IPhone 5 to a Galaxy 5."

yes,yes,yes,Galaxy s5 tops all phones. No flaws! Really recommend this phone!!
yes,no,yes,"I rated a lower value on the design only due to the way the phone is plugged in to charge. I hate the little piece you have to ""move"" out of the way in order to plug it in. I can see this falling off, breaking off or not closing at some point."
no,yes,no,"I loved my phone when I first got it now it gives me issues, the screen goes black when listening to Pandora and I have to turn the phone off to get it to work again. Also not able to receive MMS they come in saying download and when I try it never works!!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, great pics, easy to use. I do not like the fact that the menu button is now a ""recently used apps"" button, but once I got used to it, it isn't too bad."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. Very fast and responsive. The display is amazing. The camera is unreal. The only downfall is , as all smartphones, battery. Its a good battery but not great. However; having the ultra saving mode is a life saver."

yes,yes,yes,"As an old guy stepping into the 21st century with my first smart phone I was overwhelmed with the power and utility of the S5.

yes,yes,yes,"Surpasses Samsung Galaxy s4,"
no,yes,yes,"Great phone... Except... It won't stop flashing ""Unfortunately, Samsung Link has stopped."" which appeared during the setup process. I've tried several times to make this popup disappear to no avail. I just got the phone yesterday, so it's brand new."

yes,yes,yes,"Clear display, fingerprint lock, health apps are great (when they work). Unfortunately it also has a lot of bloatware, and the Samsung support information is sparse at best.Very high frustration factor if things aren't working as expected. Or even just to learn more about the features on the phone."

yes,yes,yes,"I've been waiting to get this phone for a long time and i got it the day it came out and it is amazing. When i got it shipped to my house it was the first time I held it or saw it in person, and i was a little sceptical about how the perferated back."
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned 4 samsung phones so far. S3, s4, note 3 and now S5. I have liked all of them. I changed the note 3 for the S5 because I gave it a try and even though I loved it I changed it for the S5 because I go exercising and I like to use the arm strap.

yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, contact is up and I see no reason to buy another phone. Battery life has weakened but that's to be expected I guess."

no,no,no,"I bought this phone a year and a half ago. At first the excitement of the features, ease of use and performance out weight the hefty price. Then as the phone gets older, the battery only last about 8 hours, the phone freezes and gets hot."
yes,yes,yes,I like the way that I can talk text. I like the way I can link up to my tablet which is also a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 8.1. My S5 is very handy when it comes to needing to look at something quickly and I don't have time to open up my tab. Love this phone!

no,yes,yes,Phone frequently quits and goes to home screen.

yes,yes,yes,"My Galaxy S5 gives access to phone, GPS, WiFi, and games almost all places and times."

yes,yes,yes,People can't hear me very clearly when I call them. And the camera is pixely. Overall it's a great phone with a good variety of things that it does. MUCH better than my galaxy s3 but there is still some needed improvement...
yes,yes,yes,I have enjoyed my new S5 immensely! The speed and performance is impressive and the battery life has been impressive thus far. My only complaint is that it isn't a world phone as my carrier has deleted the quad band capabilities... but while I'm in the States it works great!!
yes,yes,yes,"I was reluctant to try this phone because of the larger size, however it isn't that much bigger. I've had No problems with the phone thus far. I had the Galaxy & really liked that, but this phone is more asvanced. I'm not sure if I will use everything on the phone, but no complaints here."
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from the S4 to the S5 3 months ago. I gave my S4 to my daughter who was thrilled to have it. Before I upgraded, I noticed several people with S5s by the amazing screen that they were using. I would have to go over and get a closer look and sure enough, it was an S5."
yes,yes,yes,My favorite part about it is the camera :) my pictures turn out really great
yes,yes,yes,I work somewhere my old phone will die before lunch I love that I can turn every thing off except the phone :) way to go samsung
yes,yes,yes,This is their best design yet. Very fast phone awesome camera and has plenty of expansion space for memory up to a 128 GB. Great job on Samsung!
yes,yes,yes,"This is my third Samsung cell phone. Absolutely have had no issues with any of them, but the features on the Galaxy S5 are the best. I would and have recommended this phone to a number of people."
yes,yes,yes,"I do love this phone for all the features that it offers. There are still some apps I have yet to try that came loaded...I may end up removing them, however, for the most part everything has been great.The only thing I can say is that I would like for the battery to last longer, but it does an okay..."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone I use it for games I cant put it down maybe 5 hours a day its on and being used the battery life is a life saver with the larger screen that is amazing then you get a heart rate monitor great for keeping your health up to date and good the only problem I had was 16GB was sort of...
yes,yes,yes,This phone meets my highest expectations except for the time it takes for the camera to focus.
yes,yes,yes,"I really like the Galaxy S5. I owned a Galaxy S1 and S3 previously and I am very happy with my upgrade to the S5. I really like the improved screen and camera, along with all the features. (Such as the camera options, water resistance, heart rate monitor, etc..."
yes,yes,yes,"The s5 galaxy is a total killer for all the android phones, everything is great plus you get to use all the features even the download booster that works like a charm, the only down side from it, is the design , looks the same as the s3 and s4 , the prize Is worth the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm very pleased with this phone, especially the camera/photo quality. I replaced my Samsung III with this phone; great improvements!"
no,no,yes,"With the S5, I really like the lock screen options. The only drawback is that the fingerprint lock doesn't always work and I think that if I had an emergency and wanted to quickly unlock it and have to constantly use the alternate password, it just defeats the purpose."
no,no,yes,I did my homework and was very excited about Samsungs Galaxy series. So many wonderful features. I started with an S4 and after multiple issues was upgraded to an S5. The camera has already failed. The touch screen is unresponsive half the time. I am always having fails of one sort or another.
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned the S5 for 3 months now. It took some getting used to since I upgraded from a Galaxy Centura. The more I use my phone, the more I can't imagine going back. If I have any criticism, it would be the change in size (ever so slightly larger than the S4 meaning covers are not compatible) and..."
yes,yes,yes,Love that i can find out something new about my features on phone every day. If dont understand how to use it can get video on utube
yes,yes,yes,"I found the features in this smart phone exceeded my expectations. From using the voice commands to be able to use the translator. The price fit my budget so much so, I was able to get a second one for my wife."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone! I especially love the water resistance, only improvements a would be in the design of the port cover."
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung I have went from a galaxy 3 to 5 I will stick with Samsung over any other products because of their great features and design
yes,yes,yes,"I just love my new S5. The battery life is greatly improved from the s3. I have realized it is very important to reset the phone at least every other day in order to shut down background programs but by doing this, I get 2-3 days out of the battery."
yes,yes,yes,I have had no issues with this Galaxy at all. It is a great phone.
yes,yes,yes,I can't find anything I don't like about this product. It does everything I want it to do and more.

yes,yes,yes,"And I would not take anything less after having the great SAMSUNG S series in my possession the S3 and S5 and the S5 has outdone itself over and over again with the crazy cool features and new and improved battery life, WOW! And it's water resistant, Very compelling!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, it is by far the best phone I have owned as of yet. It is extremely fast and it also holds its charge for a long time even when I am using it throughout the day."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome. The display is so large and colorful. Love it!
yes,yes,yes,"I like this phone and all its features but have a little trouble with downloading speed. It's slower than my S3, even though it's suppose to be better. I love that I can sync this phone and do everything on it that I can do on my laptop. In fact, I rarely use my laptop anymore."
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love my Galaxy S5 and loved the S3 as well. They have been extremely dependable (more so than my husband's ""other brand"" that kept failing). Now the whole family has switched to the Galaxy S5.The bright clear as life display is amazing."
yes,yes,yes,I have had the S3 and now the S5 and both have worked wonderfully. Plenty of features and fast
yes,yes,yes,I liked having the aluminum on the first galaxy when I had it. It felt sturdier and better. Although I do like the look of the plastic. Also I think an upgrade on the speakers would be nice and better placement. Other than that it's an amazing phone.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone I've had it just two weeks and I just love it the fingerprint scanner is the best feature on the phone in my opinion
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome but I recently started getting a bug to where my camera gets disabled and I can't use it with its default app or any other apps and if I wait for a while it will let me use it again but overall this is an amazing phone
yes,yes,yes,"Super fast, user friend and features that no other device has love this product!!"
yes,yes,yes,I love the Samsung products. I have had this particular phone for 2 years and have no complaints of consequence. I would love a bit more writing space in the text area and I just think all phones are overpriced which is why only 4 stars in a couple of areas.
no,no,yes,Love everyting about it EXCEPT the battery life i had mine only 6 months or so and the battery life started dropping big time i have to charge it every 3 or 4 hours and im not even on it . but other than that great phone.
no,yes,no,Loved my phone but had issues after factory hard reset locked me out of my accounts.
yes,yes,yes,I haven't had a chance to get all the way into mines but from playing around with my friends S5 I KNOW I'll love mines. Thanks Samsung. You'll hardly ever let me down on anything!
yes,yes,yes,I am a mother to a baseball loving young man. The S 5 was my main camera for his games. On more then one occasion I was able to catch a shot of the ball in mid air! The other capabilities of the phone made sharing super simple.
yes,no,yes,THE HOME SCREEN BUTTON AND POWER BUTTON NEEDS TO B A LITTLE LESS TOUCHY. IT TENDS TO POWER ON WHEN IN YOUR POCKET WHEN YOU HAVE THINGS IN YOUR POCKET THAT COME IN CONTACT WITH THE BUTTONS.
yes,yes,yes,I have used this phone for a couple of months now and I just love it. The best feature about this is the fingerprint unlock.
no,no,yes,"After three years and just dropping the insurance, the screen somehow cracked, even with a case and screen protector. Have no idea how it happened since I did not drop it and am careful with everything. I replaced it with a much less expensive Moto g play and am happy with it."
no,no,no,This phone has been nothing but a headache in the last year I have had to have my phone replaced 4 times because of major issues down to the touch screen not working right out of the box to the speaker not working right out of the box software issues and freezing up so bad that you have to pull the...
yes,yes,yes,"good and dependable Its big, fine and great camera"

yes,no,yes,"Dropped a lot, still works, screen flickers when brightness low"
yes,yes,yes,"The screen can withstand many rough handling and multiple touches, the phone itself is a water proof device so there is no big deal if you should wash it with your clothes unknowingly."
no,no,yes,I don't think I have come across any problems that are relevant to Samsung . The apps are where most of my problems come from. The typical running out of ram and storage. Phone becomes sluggish and so on. ...
no,no,no,"I purchased this phone on Groupon supposedly unlocked for all carriers. The phone arrived if it's Verizon it is unlocked, however it contains many Verizon brick apps that I am unable to use or get rid of. That's a waste of storage when phones these days barely come with any."
no,yes,yes,"Best phone ever.It just gets way to hot.can cook a egg on it but a case solves this problem mine did get so hot.the screen cracked.tho but still love it,and hope to get it repaired.I would be disappointed if they would not fix this."
yes,yes,yes,"Very dependable, reliable and cost is low. I have been a Samsung Galaxy user for over 20 years."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung outdid themselves with the S3, that phone made me a Samsung user... I never had the S4, because I was content with my S3... Then came the S5, that was the first time I went out of my way to purchase a phone."
no,yes,no,Drops calls bad receptionIS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO FIX THIS OR IS IT THE PHONE
yes,yes,yes,Got this from Groupon for dinged and scratched used late model phones. It came in better shape than I'd imagined. Performance on this phone is pretty phenomenal considering I'm comparing it to my GS7 Edge. This two year older phone isn't much slower. Of course the 7 Edge looks way better.
yes,yes,yes,"THIS IS A GREAT SMART PHONE AND EASY TO USED, I LOVE THIS CELL PHONE AND SOON I WILL UPGRADE IT"
yes,yes,yes,My only complaint about this phone is the available storage. I constantly need to delete things to free up storage

yes,yes,yes,"This was a fantastic upgrade to the S3, which was also a great phone itself. I loved the battery life and integration of the IR blaster, as I always tend to misplace the TV remote. It also came in handy in controlling the Air Conditioner too!"
yes,yes,yes,It is a an awesome phone with top notched state of the art upgrades from last version
yes,yes,yes,I STILL A FAN OF SAMSUNG.
yes,yes,yes,I currently have a S3 and I do love the line of Samsung Products but I don't know what went wrong with my S5. I purchased it and sent it back because I was having issues. I got back another a brand new one and was experiencing the same issues.

yes,yes,yes,I love my phone!! It's very versatile light weight and colorful!

yes,yes,yes,"Switching from the Samsung Galaxy S3 to the Samsung Galaxy S5 has been so much fun. The differences in the display, apps layout, and SPEED are phenomenal. Well done, Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,"Loved my galaxy s5. It was a terrific phone; slim design, lightweight, durable, only had one problem. That was finding the right case to accent its features correctly for me. Most were just too bulky, heavy etc. Finally found leather flip case."
no,no,no,Since I purchased the S5 I had a very bad experience with the phone. It was getting hot and it turned off constantly. I spoke to Verizon and they said I had to go to a corporate store to have it seen by a tech there. Every store I went was a third party so I gave up.
yes,yes,yes,Tried early Windows mobile then iPhone. Decided to try Android. Samsung Galaxy has been great.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone since its release & I must say, I'm STILL satisfied with it. I damaged my battery & had to have it replaced. During the time I was waiting for the replacement battery to arrive, I used my son's iPhone 6s Plus."
yes,yes,yes,Love my S5.And just discovered new features today!
yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy S5 design is nice. It is easy to use. I only wish the keys were a bit more spaced so not so easy to 'fat finger"" them"
yes,yes,yes,I have been using my Galaxy S5 for 2 years now and it has been a great phone. The new iPhone 7 is coming out and its features don't compare well to the S5. The camera and microSD card capability are better. I'll be sticking with this phone until I upgrade in a year or more to another Samsung device.
yes,yes,yes,"I really do like this phone and all it has to offer. I do wish it had more RAM. There are some applications that drain my battery. But overall this device is awesome, performs at a reasonable speed, and is very durable."
yes,yes,yes,Has a lot of nice features. I think that I will really like this phone
yes,yes,yes,I am using this phone after the Samsung recall. Moving from a large phone to this small phone is a huge change. This s5 is a nice phone but it's small.
yes,yes,yes,"bought this phone after upgrading from another samsung phone. love its working, smooth and efficient.and lots of features and customizations. will keep it for near future."
yes,yes,yes,"Calls, Internet, Apps, Google Maps work excellent. Camera is good except little to no close up macro focus like the S3."
yes,yes,yes,I have had this phone for a couple of years and recently started using it again for business. It still performs wonderfully!
yes,yes,yes,"Honestly can't complain, Phone was durable and lasted 3 years, But uncompareable to the new galaxy"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone overall, would like more battery life. Not able to pair with Samsung smart tv"

yes,yes,yes,I recommend it to everyonegffgffg gtgtyteyty 5t56565656
yes,yes,yes,I have always been a Samsung user ..from my cell phone to tv's ..and I will always be ..from their sleek design to the speed of their hand held devices. .I will never switch !
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone. The only thing I wish is that it had more storage on the device but no big deal because I can put everything on a memory card which is wonderful!!! This phone is pretty durable as I have horses and have dropped it and lost it a lot!
yes,yes,yes,I have had this phone 18 months and it still works as well as the day I got it.
yes,yes,yes,"It is a very durable and lasting phone. Does a lot for the owner. I love the S-Health features. If you need a nice phone and do not want to spend much, get yourself a phenomenal Samsung Galaxy S5."
yes,yes,yes,We love this phone. 3 of our family members have one. It has super clear calls and graphics.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone however, it doesn't rate excellent with me because of the memory issue. If you put anything at all on the phone the memory is instantly filled up. You can install an SD card for pictures and videos which is fantastic."

yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone.also I would recommend it for a first phone.
yes,yes,yes,This product seems to overheat while charging and running apps athat the same time.

yes,yes,yes,"I have always wanted a galaxy, didn\u2019t matter which one. I'm still a beginner but I learn new things about the phone every day. It is exciting to see what the phone can actually do and I get emails once a week from Samsung showing me things that my phone can do, if I haven't figured them out..."

yes,yes,yes,Samsung is the only smart phone product that I have been full satisfied with. Much better than an Iphone

yes,yes,yes,its fast and smart all samsung products last a lot a time
yes,yes,yes,"I like the productit's perfect. but, just for a few things when it's time to update ,the download stuff,I don't use it, and take space from my own personal space."
yes,yes,yes,I had a Galaxy S3 but I dropped it and broke LCD. I got this certified pre own from Verizon. Earphone jack is loose otherwise like new. Had Android 5.0 then upgrade to 6.0.1. Excellent camera. Removable battery and SD card. This is a nearly perfect smartphone. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
yes,yes,yes,I was very happy with my S3 I had used fro 4 years . I looked into the s5 and am so glad I bought it. I love the features . The ease of use for me thats a must because I have a hectic busy schedule I need a device that is quick and easy to operate.
yes,yes,yes,I was so use to S6 Edge but S5 has features S6 doesn't. That I found cool.
yes,yes,yes,This is my first smartphone and I am very impressed! I am familiar with the operating of other smartphones but prefer the size and features of the Galaxy S5. It is easy to use with a clean look. The sound quality is great and the camera is outstanding.
yes,yes,yes,I can't wait til I can afford to buy an s7 I can only imagine how great the phone is.... until then u love my S5!!!!
yes,yes,yes,This phone has beautiful photography features and great clarity. I am on my second Samsung S5. It is a very durable phone. I like the fact that you can change the battery. The design is easy to use. I like the phone so well that i just bought the Galaxy tablet. My former tablet is an Apple product.
no,yes,no,And I may return for the new one now that expandable memory is back! But will it be as tough as my current one?
yes,no,yes,To many issues with the S5. Had three replacements and still have issues.
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone!! Would absolutely recommend to anyone!!
no,yes,no,"Thank goodness for warranties, I'm now on my third replacementl of this model phone. The original Samsung I bought started glitching out, for no reason other than that it was a lemon. The second, replacement phone's camera went out after a few months, and wouldn't auto focus."
no,no,yes,This is my second s5. First one crashed. We'll see how it goes.
yes,no,yes,"Speedy, easy, and reliable! Cons: battery hog & fragile. It cracked in the 1st week despite the case & screen protector. Overall, pretty happy with it."
yes,no,yes,Not a bad phone at all. I feel like the S4 was a little quicker but the S5 has better features and faster charging. The only drawback is the door that covers your charging port. It'll break every few months. Buy back up doors online and you're good to go!
yes,yes,yes,I don't use too much apps but I like taking pics and the colors are amazing
yes,yes,yes,Bought the Galaxy 5 almost 2 years ago. It has held up unbelievably and the battery is performing well.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. I use it to stream netflix, manage my daily life, etc."
yes,no,yes,"This is my 9th Galaxy S5. I don't buy other phones because this has everything you'd ever need and more at best value - particularly removable battery/SD card, and it is water resistant."
yes,yes,yes,"Photos are crisp, sharp and vibrant! Love it"
yes,yes,yes,I had and IPhone hated it..glad I'm back
yes,no,yes,"This phone is faster and more powerful than my S3 and has a bigger battery. The bloatware and ads and the fact that I have 111 apps loaded on a phone (as opposed to 42) with very few of my personal apps does make my S3 (which I loved dearly) look good, but I am willing to try and compensate for all..."
yes,no,yes,Just upgraded from the S4 and it can't be compared!
yes,yes,yes,"I'm in love with the ease of the keyboard, love love love the camera"
yes,yes,yes,"WiFi not ""Reliable"" when ""away from Home"". More built in Ram I.E. 64Gig would be an improvement."
yes,yes,yes,Just upgraded my Galaxy S3 to the Galaxy S5 and so far it's been a great phone. Don't t really care for the all white background in the menu settings but I can get past it
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone for a little over a year now and I still absolutely love this phone and all the features!
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone that does so much. Just as good as some of the current phones releasing.
yes,no,yes,It has lots of apps that you can't delete. I don't like that.
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. It is smaller than the note 4 i previously had with all the features and great service i was looking for. I am 100% satisfied. Great job Samsung. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a quality phone at a great price. Worth the investment.
yes,yes,yes,"Live the depth, ,high quality and clairatiy of all pictures I take. Also everyone I show, also comments on the quality and how pretty the pictures are."
yes,yes,yes,Was kind of iffy on upgrading but really like a lot of the features better then the galaxy 3 which I swore by
yes,yes,yes,"Besides minor problems with display, this phone is everything you could look for."

yes,yes,yes,"I love my S5! When I went looking for a phone, I wanted something easy and child-friendly, and this is it! It came pre-loaded with Kid's mode that has been a life saver! My three-year old knows that is where she needs to go to find her games and videos."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I had a iphone 5c and it's nothing compared to this samsung s4 . I like the lightness and the way the phone is designed. I can see better and I can actually see the words. This samsung phone is a 5 star for me especially because it's faster than the iPhone 5 I had.
yes,yes,yes,Battery life is poor. But is easily navigatable. Love the navigation and map apps.
yes,yes,yes,"My last phone was an S3. This S5 seems to have a better feel. The only complaint I have is the internal memory is too small, but that was a choice, but did not realize how much memory Samsung and Verizon programs would take up that cannot be moved to SD memory."
yes,yes,yes,"When I wanted to upgrade from the S4, the S6 had just come out and I found out it wouldn't take an SD card. I decided to just upgrade to the S5 so I could use the micro SD for extra storage space."

yes,yes,yes,This phone has the best camera I've ever seen on a phone and the most eye popping colors you've ever seen.

yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It has a great camera and it's very easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,"I like the back feature, and the close out feature at the bottom of the screen. I ocassion ally have a problem pulling up pictures in the message/text feature. I like the new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, but couldn't find a case that would protect the glass. So I took it back."
yes,yes,yes,"Honestly love this Samsung galaxy s5, the camera quality is pretty good. The only thing since it is a bit older phone is it lags sometimes. Maybe it's because of my downloads, but sometimes it will lagg on you here and there. Overall this phone is so worth it."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is really nice is great.I love Samsung galaxy s..love..my phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung GalaxyS5 so much that I traded back down from my Samsung S6. What I love about the Samsung Galaxy S5 is it's durability, especially the fact that it is water resistant."
no,no,yes,i guess it was alright but i dropped it once and the lcd broke which mad the screen yellow
yes,yes,yes,Most phones can be confusing but samsungs are fast and easy to use when needed. But Could use a little better camera but that's just what I think cause I'm a person who loves to take pictures.
yes,yes,yes,The phone has pretty good features. I loved fingerprint that made the phone safer.
no,no,yes,So I had an s5 on cricket last year and went to apple for the iPhone in June.... Then in November I came back with the note 5 and now since my iPod died I got a s5 to replace it and I'm realizing how much I missed my s5
yes,yes,yes,Really love this phone it looks great and does what a phone should do.
yes,yes,yes,"Great battery life, fair camera. This is my seconde S5...I dropped the 1st one and the screen shattered."
yes,yes,yes,it does everything i need to i always encourage all my friends and family to buy samsung products
yes,yes,yes,I have been very happy with this phone. It is quite easy to use and figure out the features.. One thing I am very pleased with the quality of the photos taken with this phone. The ease of use and editing options are great.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my galaxy, I wish it took better pictures tho! I'd recommend it to anyone!! Awesome phone"
yes,yes,yes,Love it but miss some features that my galaxy S4 had.
no,no,no,Not all the apps are working correctly after a replacement of my phone. Very disappointed!
no,no,no,"I purchased my galaxy s5 1 month ago after being a loyal iPhone user because of all the rave about the galaxys, Big Mistake!! This is the worst phone I have ever hAD. PHONES DON'T SHOW UP HALF THE TIME,SERVICE IS TERRIBLE,VOLUME IS LOW,IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET AND RECEIVE TEXTS, I UNPLUGGED THE PHONE..."
yes,yes,yes,I have always had an IPhone. This is my first experience with Samsung Galaxy and hands down...This product and its performance and featurs are far more superior than the IPhone!
yes,yes,yes,"S5 is the ultimate phone for the general public, it has all you need for the everyday use and much more."
yes,yes,yes,I thought after a month I would adjust to it. It did not happen
yes,yes,yes,This is truly the best phone I have ever owned. I've been using cell phones for about 12-13 years and this one is awesome. I am using the shimmering White and love it. It has an awesome camera also. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is shopping for a phone. Thanks Samsung for the Galaxy.
yes,yes,yes,"Love the features of the phone lots of fun , camera dose a lot for as old as it is."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung galaxy s5. At first I thought I wasn't going to like this phone because it was a lot larger than my iPhone 4s, however, I got used to it quick. This phone is super fast and more durable than expected."
yes,yes,yes,"Love, love it! Has few bugs but nothing is perfect. Only thing I didn't like is the finger print security lock just stopped working one day for no reason and never worked again and the backup password wouldn't open it either. I'd recommend this phone to family and friends."
no,yes,no,Seeing as my options for getting a new phone were to say the least expensive... and my warranty was over I decided to save a few bucks and change the part my self. After watching several youtube videos the process seemed invasive but doable.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm always pleased with Samsung cell phones. I've had them since I had flip phones and dare I ever stray away, I always end up coming back. Design is always great but most important I never have issues with them."

no,yes,yes,It's more than a phone. It's a micro computer. Keeps me on my toes
yes,yes,yes,I replaced my Galaxy Note 2 with an S5 and really like it. You definitely want to turn on the power saver features though. Even though it's smaller than the Note 2 the lighter weight is worth it. It's actually easier to hold on long calls.
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone ever, I don't get tired of it"
yes,yes,yes,I like Samsung because I like all there phones like this one and the Samsung s7 there both awesome phones.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my S5 it can do everything I need it to. And since I'm clumsy with my stuff when I drop it in a puddle or even go swimming with it, on accident, it doesn't get water damaged."

yes,yes,yes,I love this s5 way butter for everything u need to do
yes,yes,yes,"I work and play in wet environments and having a phone that can resist most spills and accidental drops in the water is necessary especially with three small children.

yes,yes,yes,In my opinion this phone is perfect for two years. after that period it began to glitch and seize up even once restored it was never the same.
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone and have gone with Samsung for my last three.Only a few issues starting with preloaded battery draining, unnecessary apps and/or adware.Needs a better battery period.Every time I switch from ultra power saving mode back to normal power saving mode I lose messages or the messages get..."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the way the phone sits in my hand and I like the way I can maneuver everything with my thumb making movies,downloading apps and playing games"
yes,yes,yes,"Since buying my Samsung, I have never had so much of a connection to technology. It helps me get organized on EVERY aspect of my life. With little technical difficulties, and all modern innovations my Samsung has never failed me; not once."
yes,yes,yes,I fell in love with Samsung when I first got my S4. I am still in love with them now with my S5. This phone is able to help me with my work when I am on the go and the battery holds up! I just wish the pre-installed apps wouldn't take up so much memory.
yes,yes,yes,"Has since migrated to the G7 Edge which I like very much. I thought not having a removable battery was going to be a problem with the edge , the battery last a long time and I'm very pleased with it. The G5 was a very good phone for me and the G7 edges even better"
yes,yes,yes,The phone works great fast easy to get the basics. I love the size and vivid colors.
yes,yes,yes,"I am still learning the numerous features that this product carries. Access to everything at the touch of a ""fingerprint""."

yes,yes,yes,This is my first s series and I love it and all that it can do

yes,yes,yes,Really love this phone. Had an iphone wasnt impressed. Love the displays and apps. So easy to manage every app.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Galaxy S5. Everything about the S5 is above average. Although I will admit that i was expecting more from it, it is all that i need. The RAM is not bad but the phone does freeze up every once in a while."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is extremely easy to use and has excellent battery life. I rely heavily on the U-power saver which still allows you to use basic phone services such as calling and texting while preserving the life of the battery.
yes,yes,yes,"Owned a Samsung Jack for many years and loved it, but new job requires that I upgrade. Have had the Galaxy 5 for only a few days, but really enjoying playing with it. Saw many great reviews before buying and can already see why."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I think it has one of the best cameras I have personally used and I love how you can customize everything the way I want it.

yes,yes,yes,"Everything about this is a wonderful experience, it really speaks volumes so to how easy it is to operate this phone and if I get another phone you can bet it will be a Samsung !!!"
yes,no,yes,"The galaxy s5 is the bees knees. It never disappoints and always there to get me out of trouble. 4glte is swift to say the least, the battery can go all day on a charge, sometimes 2. I also enjoy getting a full charge in about 40 minutes. The HD display is incredible."
yes,yes,yes,I love the s5 because I can see better. I love the idea I can change font to huge! Graphics are colorful...
yes,yes,yes,Although my experience with this phone is nearly 2 years old - It works properly & efficiently. My only wish is that it would utilize my SD memory better. There is lots of room on the SD card but phone memory is full.
yes,yes,yes,I have not has a smartphone before and I am totally overwhelmed by the overall quality and features of this product. I need someone to come and walk me through all the features and how to use all the apps that I have already installed.

yes,yes,yes,"This Product Has The Unique Feature Of Micro-Usb 3.0 Faster Data Transfer thar Regular Micro usb, Even Ten Times Faster than regular usb."
yes,yes,yes,I love it. It does everything super fast and does it with battery power left at the end of the day.
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung Galaxy is an amazing phone. It has many useful features such as an amazing camera, great touch screen response as well as voice response. Also, it is very durable. Being quite a bit clumsy, I drop my phone often(sometimes even getting it wet) and still it functions almost as if it were..."
no,no,yes,I switched from an I-phone 5 and was very disappointed. You have to keep deleting pictures or apps for space. And the battery doesn't last long.
yes,yes,yes,I would recommend this device to anyone of any age. It's very simple to get accustomed to and very easy to personalize.
yes,yes,yes,Love Samsung and I love my s5 even more than the s4. Love that its water resistant and I don't have to worry about it at the beach :)
yes,yes,yes,Just got this Samsung phone & I'm loving it!! Had an IPhone but this is so much better. So glad I switched to this Galaxy!!!
yes,yes,yes,i love the fact that it has a led light and lets you know you have notifications without the sound on and the light tells you or when its running low in battery. In my honest opinion i think it dies to quick but overall its a real nice phone and i love it.

yes,yes,yes,"This phone is easy to use. Its just the right size and weight. It will do everything I want to do and more. I am learning something new every day, I have confidence in my phone that it will preform if I ever need it in an emergency--it's a Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,Samsung makes the best phone. Actually its not a phone its a galaxy
yes,yes,yes,"it is easy to set up and use love the apps, love the amount of information it can hold"
yes,yes,yes,"Some nice features, but a big battery hog. The spell check is good, but as I type, I sometimes see a swoosh and the word being typed splits in two. Most frustrating. Pictures wont download. Have to send them to the cloud to retrieve on my laptop. Tech support suggested that."
yes,yes,yes,"Purchased this phone for my wife. She didn't want it at first but now she loves it. She can now keep up with the kids and grandkids through the phone, texting, sharing photos and facebook. It also comes in handy for getting travel routes and current traffic reports."
yes,yes,yes,This is the geatest phone I have ever owned and I most DEFINITELY recommend this!!

yes,yes,yes,"I am not very ""smartphone "" smart but the s5 is amazing."
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect size, even for small hands. I truly like the leather feel to the back of the phone. Plus the camera is excellent, no restriction to the amount of pictures, videos, or even apps you download since you have a choice to use a micro sd card."
yes,yes,yes,I love it my kids love it and now mom is thinking about going getting one and I think everyone should have one
yes,yes,yes,"Ever since I got my Samsung, I have loved it! The speed is amazing and the reliability of things being at my finger tip without having to worry about if it would launch, or if it would not load. The screens size and water proof just make the experience better then ever."
yes,yes,yes,Used to have iPhone switched to samsung. Works great with Samsung TV and tab

yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone has features that my other phone had but ibwould not purchase no other phone then Samsung cause they have the best features, and i would recommend this phone any Samsung to anyone even a complete stranger haha, but over all I give this as many stars as I think it deserves 100* stars."

yes,no,yes,I have not had any problems with this phone. The color is great.
yes,yes,yes,The features are great. Stays charged for a long time. The only thing I don't like is charger is hard to plug in.
yes,no,yes,I like the lay out of the apps and how you can set them up . The new lay out of the calendar it is easier to use then the old set up . The talk to text and the I am driving feature tell everyone that I am driving and I will get back to them .
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone but I have to send it off to get it fixed can't wait to get it back
yes,yes,yes,I am extremely pleased with this phone. When I think my phone is awesome I learn more about it to make it more awesome. I am able to have the most important apps on my phone now with the 16 GB internal space to help serve my community. The colors are so vivid on this phone.
yes,yes,yes,This is a good phone. The camera is great. The only thing that isn't so great is the Swype keyboard. I feel like the Swype keyboard could be more accurate.
yes,yes,yes,"I now use my S5 for all of my comm needs and have even jettisoned my work provided smart phone. The Samsung ease of operation is tops as far as I'm concerned. I bought a S4 and Tab 10.5 for my granddaughter, S6 for the wife, and a S5 and Tab S2 for me. Very happy with all of them."
yes,yes,yes,The menu bar across the top is a great feature and the notifications bar is very useful

yes,yes,yes,I like how good it runs it fast and has a big screen and a good camara and you upgraded
yes,yes,yes,"I've used Samsung phones for years. I won't spend my money on or use a phone that isn't a Samsung. The Galaxy's are the best. Great performance, a ton of features and I hardly ever have any problems. And they last what seems like forever! Very durable phones..."
yes,yes,yes,I'm 68 years old and I love how easy it is to operate this phone. I think I'm going to buy Samung S6.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the size shape and weight , all around a great phone"

yes,no,yes,"I've used many types of yesterday and today's technical, technology's like, smartphones, tablets, fruit products, (two thumb down, definitely not a fan of those) laptops, Druid's (many different types).So for the past 3 years I have been converted to Samsung! Keep Kicking it!"
no,yes,no,Overall I think it easily tops any iPhone in appearance and features. The tab that covers the charging port broke off after a year and half which is not bad but now it's not water resistant anymore. I did drop it in water when the cover was in tact and it was fine afterwards.
yes,yes,no,"The only problem I have with my phone is the microphone. Everybody tells me it sounds like I am in a holler. The microphone doesn't pick up sound on my phone anyway, for the most part. I truly miss my old flip phone. I am spoiled to the many things I can do with this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this phone for 3 weeks, and I love it. I switched from the iPhone 6, and would not go back to Apple. It is easy to use, great battery life, and great Apps!! Excellent product!!"
yes,yes,yes,I have owned the S5 for several years and have really loved it. It handles the speed and apps really well. My biggest complaints are I have had several instances of batteries going quick and overheating. Luckily I have the removable batteries.

yes,yes,yes,This phone has an excellent camera and other features but the sound quality is not that great when using the speaker.
no,yes,yes,"I like everything on this smart phone, except for the performance with making and receiving calls. Even when I am in an area that has good 4 G service, there are many occasions my phone does not ring and I have missed very important calls which go directly to voice mail."

yes,yes,yes,There's no doubt that this Samsung Galaxy s5 is the best phone I have ever owned I will probably never go back to other brand. The camera is 10 times better all of the apps seem to run faster and the biggest thing for me is the bluetooth it works flawlessly.

yes,yes,yes,It has great features. I can do alot of different things with my Samsung galaxy s5.
no,yes,no,"Everything about this phone is great, with the exception of a few areas. The camera is awful in my opinion and rarely takes clear and colorful images.

yes,yes,yes,"great camera, responds fast, lots of reasons to like this phone!"

yes,yes,yes,"I have an S6 for personal use so when my office got me a phone I decided to stick with what I knew. They were able to grab me an S5 and it is great. I used to have an S3 before moving onto the S6, and I loved how you can access the battery and add more data storage with the Micro SD slot."
yes,yes,yes,Over 2 years ago I lost my phone in the San Diego ocean some kids found my phone and returned it to this day I am still using my same phone I have had my phone for almost 3 years 6 months my pictures are still amazing my phone still works just like the day I bought it.
no,no,yes,"I have had this phone for 2 years. 1 st year was great. After that i noticed a decline in preformance and occasional lag. The phone was still very usable,but very annoying.

yes,yes,yes,"I love my S5, would definately recommend it to anyone. The phone has awesome features, love the camera, as well as the split screen option.

yes,yes,yes,I like that it is lightweight and fits easily in pockets. User friendly phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Really love this phone, only would upgrade to newer version. Prefer over iPhones. Wish the price wasn't so hefty, but overall worth it."

yes,yes,yes,"I love my Galaxy S5. It has alot of wonderful features. The security is also great. At the moment I'm using the fingerprint security option, which is an excellent feature, to protect ur phone from unwanted users. I love the slim style of the phone, the color, and weight of the phone."

yes,yes,yes,"I recommended this phone to my dad. He loves games and so the screen size was nice. I have had this phone for over 2 years, I love it and will get another one when it comes time, and my dad is very happy with his. My mom tried it and is jealous because she likes it too."
yes,yes,yes,I love my Galaxy S5 except for the changes made to the Android operating system which I don't think is a Galaxy issue but an Android issue. Because of the changes Android made I can no longer put almost everything on the memory card and have the phone still access it properly or like it use to.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S5 is awesome. I fell in love with this model when I discovered that it was waterproof. I can attest to the waterproofing as I dropped mine in the toilet 3 days after I received it.
yes,yes,yes,I have had many phones over the years and not one of them compare to my Samsung. I like all the features and options for customizing as well. One thing I wish we were able to do is delete the apps that come preloaded on our phones that we are not using. I definitely do not want nor need the NFL app.

yes,yes,yes,I would like to start off by saying Samsung makes some of the best products. The galaxy s5 has made my life so much easier. I hope to try the galaxy s6 very soon. I was able to take amazing pictures on my trip to Europe with my family and that in itself an amazing thing.
yes,yes,yes,"This has been a very good phone. I like Android, the camera is better than I phone, and battery life is much better. I will own another."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great, it gets wet a lot and seems to not be affected. Power saving mode saves my life when theres no charger around."
no,yes,yes,"The phone does not respond well. Touch the camera and the messaging opens, read your email and it crashes. Open one app and wait 10 seconds for it to respond. I thought it was my old version of the S5 that was scrambled but this brand new phone does the exact same things as my last."
no,yes,no,Have had this phone for about a year and a half. Other than a broken screen which was at my fault. I have had no issues. It functions everyday just as it should.

yes,yes,yes,"I have used many androids and I've used IOS (iPhone) and I have found the galaxies to be the best. I have had a galaxy s3, s4, and now I have the s5 active and I love it. They are by far the best phones on the market hands down."

yes,yes,yes,Luv my samsung galaxy phone. Thank you Verizon for suggesting this purchase.

yes,yes,yes,"My only complaint is that I wish the phone had more internal memory, and that it had a longer battery life. Otherwise, this phone is awesome!"
yes,yes,yes,I enjoy the size and ease of use that this phone has. It might not be as big of a deal anymore but it is also one of the last (most recent) phones to have the removable battery and SD card. Also I have peace of mind using it with wet hands and in wet conditions.

no,yes,no,I've had two Samsung phones that ran lollipop now and both have been horrible experiences. Video/audio sync issues. Bluetooth issues. Numbers/letters on the lock screen turning to white boxes. Hopefully the next version of Android will work with Samsung software better.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the multi-screen, high def screen, s health is very useful for everyday activities, Camera is great for taking pictures, I would prefer this to any one looking for a new phone, Samsung is the greatest type of phones that you could get, If you do get one you will absolutely love it"

yes,yes,yes,I just started using this phone and it's really easy to manage. I like it has lots of apps but some of the originally established apps are useless or I don't need. I wish I could design all the apps at the first use.

yes,yes,yes,"Love the galaxy s5, just recently bought this phone and I love it, I don't know if I would buy the newest phone out because I like this one so much. No complaints at all, Samsung knows what they are doing for sure, from their flat screen TVs to their smart phones, have yet to use one of Samsung..."
yes,yes,yes,"While I've had a Samsung tablet for a year now (I'm slow to the game, what can I say?), I've only had the phone for a couple of months, and I'll say right off that this was the best choice of phone for someone like me."

While I was happy with the Live Tiles and how smooth the Windows 8.1 operating system ran, I hated everything else."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone's features as well as the sleek design of my s5. It can do things from calling and txting to connecting with a wireless priner to being a remote control for other devices. It is easy and fun to use. My phone also has a great keyboard and a great look.
yes,yes,yes,Meets my needs very well. I am well satisfied. I would purchase another Samsung product.
yes,yes,yes,I am loving this phone so far. I had an older Samsung Galaxy S3 before switching to the S5. The new phone runs a lot better than the old S3.

yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, I really love it, easy to navigate, nice big screen. The color is fantastic, camera, is great. The only issue I have had is that it forces you to update even if you don't want to. Other than that, best phone I've ever had!"

yes,yes,yes,"I love my S5. There are a lot of perks, but it is not without its hiccups. I love the picture and screen resolution! One bad thing is that I notice it gets real hot. I don't know if it is because I use it almost all day long constantly or its a design flaw."

yes,no,yes,"This phone is very easy to use, but like with any technology, there are sometimes issues. It occasionally locks up. About once a week, I do a hard refresh and that seems to help with the majority b of the issues. I'm sure it's software and application issues anyway."

yes,yes,yes,"I was hooked on and loyal to my Droid Bionic.Did allot of research for smart phones with replaceable batteries, and this one, won out. Unfortunately the S6 ended that feature.This phone is fast, sturdy, looks sleek and stylish. ..jeans, suit or tux."

yes,yes,yes,"This phone has been fantastic. It is still fast, is constantly updating, and is still fun (I've had one for a while now). The only issues with it is it loses charge kind of quickly, and the charging port cover is not well attached. And that, like all new phones, costs a little too much."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone..upgrade from Samsung mini..great features..

yes,yes,yes,I love the galaxy s5 I love it because it's very durable and you can put a memory chip in it I think all phone should do that it is easy to use and I would never go back to use any other for once you go samsung you don't go back to any other product
yes,yes,yes,Very nice product well made easy to use A#1 just perfect for myself love it
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my phone and have from the first day. There is so much you can do and so many ways to do them on this amazing phablet. It's so much more than a phone and more than a tablet.
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone! There are a few things that I wish it had but not any big deal. It's still great.
yes,yes,yes,I've had apple products in the past and by far I like the Samsung Galaxy S5 phone better than the apple phones. It is a huge improvement from the S4. It says that it is waterproof (although I am not going to test it out).
yes,yes,yes,I am so happy with the phone. I wouldn't change a thing about. I am really loving the health app that comes with phone.

yes,yes,yes,Basically the S4 and S6 are better than the s5. Believe me. Good job on the S6. Purchased one last week.
no,yes,no,I've owned this phone for about a year and have had very few problems with it. All the basic functions work great withe the exception of the fingerprint scanner which just suddenly stopped working.
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone this is the first Samsung smart phone i have owned and i love the features and ease of use the battery life is great all around great product.
yes,yes,yes,"I LOVE everything about it!! The color is amazing, crystal!! I use it for everything"
yes,yes,yes,The phone has good things and bad things about it. The plug ports are really easy to accidentally break off so it no longer makes it water resistant. It likes to over heat really easy. The Camera is awesome and so is the editing. I prefer the galaxy note 3 or note 4 over the s5
yes,yes,yes,I finally have a great phone to fit with my demand for near perfection. A perfect match for my Samsung Tab S 10.5. Love it.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. The only bad thing is the speakers. It needs better speakers.
yes,yes,yes,I have the galaxy s5 in white. I love the phone although I've had a couple minor issues with it such as the charge port door is wearing out so it doesn't like to stay closed. It does drag a little opening and closing apps. I love how it's dust and waterproof... it actually is.!...
yes,yes,yes,"I really love my S5. I consider it an excellent product. I did mark it down in ""Value"" as I think all smart phones are over-priced. But other than that, this is an excellent product! Strongly recommend."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung 5s is a really good phone but there are a few things that need work. The battery life isn't quite what was expected with mediun us it runs down after about 5 to 6 hours of use.
yes,yes,yes,"Good solid phone. Nothing great, but more of what we expect from Samsung and the Galaxy S line. I had the S3 which was a radical new phone. The S5 is a few steps up. Like the waterproof feature and being able to take out the battery and insert an SD card."
yes,yes,yes,Like the phone freezes sometimes other than that works great battery could be better to long laster
yes,yes,yes,"After having to give up a company-owned Blackberry Storm, I switched to a Samsung Galaxy S5. What a nice delight! Lots of great features that I wasn't used to, like the ability to set apps to connect only when a wireless signal is available so I'm not draining my data plan."
yes,yes,yes,this product is great. a lot of great features. love it
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone overall. Very fast. I do wish the FM Radio was unlocked. The back camera is very good and clear. I do wish the front camera was better though. Even though I do not take very many selfies, they always look grainy."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. Much better than any iPhone I have ever had
yes,no,yes,To start off the color on screen is awesome!! The galaxy edge has the best screen ever ..the edge screens show you the time as well as several notifications that you choose to have show up.
yes,yes,yes,S5s are great phones but my old one crashed when loading the new software. The new one would not load notifications due to a conflict with Google Now. This 3Rd phone has spontaneously wiped itself 3 days after receiving. All is running smoothly now.
yes,yes,yes,Really really great phone easy to use and durable.
yes,yes,yes,"I don't know a lot about phones but the S5 definitely makes life a little easier. The battery usually lasts me about a day unless I've been on something lIke Netflix. The screen is the perfect size, fits right in my back pocket. No complaints here :)"
yes,yes,yes,This phone was a great choice. It has great features and is easy to use!
yes,yes,yes,Overall this is a very good phone. Wish some of the preloaded programs were able to uninstall.
yes,yes,yes,This is S5 is the best of its kind. Does everything and more than I need. Will take me a few months to figure everything out. So keeps me busy.
yes,yes,yes,I am a senior citizen (66 years) and my daughter talked me into purchasing the Galaxy S5....I do remember to thank her daily. I love how easy it's been to learn to use this smartphone! When I hit a 'road block' there seems to be no end to the ready assistance of those more savvy!
yes,yes,yes,"I was an Apple user and switched to Android Galaxy S5. I love that I can customize my phone to my liking. I find it easy to use and quality of the sound is great. I can hear when I am on my phone with out a problem, which was an issue with my iphone."
yes,yes,yes,love this device. will get samsung next time again.
yes,yes,yes,I was very fond of my old phone and I was very reluctant to get this one. I love it! This phone is very customizable and has all the apps and games I want. I am very pleased with Samsung and all of the features!

yes,yes,yes,"This phone has everything I need plus some,couldn't get a better phone. Also takes awesome pictures !"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is easy to use. It takes great pictures. Not bulky
yes,yes,yes,I just got this after using an S4 Mini for about 2 years. I was worried that going to such a bigger phone would be a tricky transition but I LOVE the bigger size. It's so easy to maneuver and so much fun to explore and use. It's got everything I need in it and more.
yes,yes,yes,I love my samsung s5 . It's very easy to use . It has alot to offer . The camera is probley the best i've ever used. The focus is great . I really like I can do 2 things at once on the same screen. The color is great too. The only part that I dont like is the glass in the phone is not very durable.
yes,yes,yes,"This is my second Samsung phone, and I have to say that Samsung does not disappoint!!! This phone is just the right size, not to big and not small. All the features are easy to use, my favorite is the camera, it takes the most amazing photos and videos."

yes,yes,yes,I am glad to own the android Galaxy 5 and will probably purchase the 6 as well.

yes,yes,yes,"This product is very easy to operate once you understand all the features available on the phone. Even if you need a simple way to operate the phone, there is a option available for easy mode on the phone. It is not complicated to use at all, and the way the graphics shows on the phone is excellent."
no,no,yes,Coming from my iPhone 5 this is a huge upgrade. From battery life to design this phone hasn't given me a reason to not be happy. It may perform slow at times but it's worth the wait.
yes,yes,yes,"As you can tell, I love this phone. I use it for everything and I don't even use my laptop very much anymore. The only small flaw I have found in it is that when I try to adjust the volume, I sometimes start to turn off the phone."
yes,no,yes,"Not what I expected..,. Loved that it was bigger than the iPhone I'd had before and that the colors were much brighter on my photos... My biggest disappointment was memory storage... I put an sd card in but I wasn't able to transfer much to the card...."
yes,yes,yes,This products are great quality. I haven't had great problems with this products like I would with other companies.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone the size and features are awesome. Would definitely recommend this phone to my friends.

yes,yes,yes,"The first smart phone I ever purchased was an iPhone 4S and I didn't think I could love anything more. I was infatuated with the soft screen, the display, and the emoji keyboard.That being said, I love my Samsung Galaxy S5 more. There are so many ways to personalize an android phone."
yes,yes,yes,"phone is great, EXCEPT don't update ,when Verizon ask for update, my phone has not worked right since, has reset itself 2 times wiping out all my memory."

yes,yes,yes,"My new Galaxy 5S replaced an iPhone, and if given the opportunity I would never go back to an iPhone. The Galaxy is much more usable for my business apps , and the ability to email, talk, and surf the web at the same time, is by far superior to the iPhone."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung galaxy s5 is very versatile and easy to use, it adapts to just about any lifestyle, it suits all of my mobile needs, I listen to music watch TV entertain and teach my children, edit photos, update my resume edit and share documents, and videos, navigate with Google maps and with so many..."

yes,yes,yes,"I have always loved samsung products, this phone is great!! Will not go to another brand."
yes,yes,yes,I had an older droid that took me forever to learn how to use. Which made me hold out on taking advantage of my upgrade option. I was pleasantly surprised how easy and user friendly the S5 is.
yes,yes,yes,This is the second galaxy cell I have owned and I am very pleased with it. Customizing the home pages and most often used apps can be frustrating.
yes,yes,yes,I do not know about all the features yet because mostly I use the camera and the picarts app...I am hooked...I would love to have the Galaxy Tab 4 so I could have a bigger screen for my artwork
yes,yes,yes,This product has been fairly easy to use. I like the way I can get back and forth from one screen to the other. The ease from sliding between screes works really well. I like the durability of the product.
yes,yes,yes,The water proofing is very revolutionary. This could save many phones as older phones are being phased out.
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone, love it can multitask. Battery drains quick though."
yes,yes,yes,Those extra features I thought I would never use turned out to be my favorite. I love the TV remote. My kid loves the apps available in the kids mode. Overall very satisfied. Phone works quickly and is easy to customize.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has great features but tends to overheat a lot and freeze up in the middle of using.it. I have to constantly restart it and the battery does not stay charged very long. Besides that, this is a great product, good picture quality and tons of features."

yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone I've ever had I've had Apple phones I had windows Phones, and phones ever since they came out nothing compares to the Samsung Galaxy s5 I cannot wait to get the galaxy FX I also have the Galaxy gear 2 which works great with my phone and I have a Samsung soundbar Samsung tab3..."
no,yes,no,"I have owned several Samsung phones, G4 and G5. The G4 keep overheating and would stop working. So when it was time to upgrade, I thought Samsung had fixed the problem of overheating. I was wrong. The G5 also overheats even if it is just plugged into my car charger."

yes,yes,yes,Better than the iPhone. Is more durable and easier to control.
yes,yes,yes,As a old timer in the use of the smart phone my question is don't need this button pushing technology and will kill the person who try to take it away. My life is so involved in the e-mail and facebook and the reaching out to search the latest rabbit hole.
yes,yes,yes,I am a busy mom I work full time I'm on mom duty 24/7 I work out I blog I cook and so on so my Samsung has been there whenever I needed it it's the go too things a person must have its fast easy to use and absolutely and amazing product I have recommended I my iPhone friends to seriously go for...

yes,yes,yes,I decided to upgrade from a free Android phone and go with the Galaxy S5. I was a little worried that it may be a little dated and some of the newer phones would be worth the extra cost. I chose this phone first of all because it of the cost and then the many positive reviews.

yes,yes,yes,"So far I am very happy with my purchase of my Samsung S5 phone. It performs well, easy to handle, good size, easy to read, pretty sturdy. I do recommend that you get a cover if you do a lot of walking or hiking. You do not want to have your phone broken when it falls."
no,no,no,"Disappointed that within 3 months of purchase, phone started randomly rebooting during phone calls. Currently have a request for service in on another Samsung product. Will be setting up one for this product now as well."
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung does everything I need from checking email, FB, internet, directions, reminders, to playing games, paying bills, making grocery lists and much more. I would be lost without my Galaxy! Taking pictures and tweaking them is a breeze. I can even buy and sell items on sites from my phone."
yes,yes,yes,Have had cell phones for years and this is the first one that I've had that I have (so far!) had reception everywhere I've been through out the US...and this include's Hawaii!
yes,yes,yes,"A great phone, with great in store support, but difficult to get answers to questions using on line manual for first time smart phone users."

yes,yes,yes,"I had an iPhone prior to this and this phone blows away the iphone. I love the features, the power and the apps."
yes,no,yes,I especially like the way it syncs & works with my tab a.
yes,yes,yes,"This feels like a high quality product, nice back cover when installed, nice chrome plastic edging , and a screen that doesn't overhang the edge (s3, s4)"

yes,yes,yes,Love my Samsung Galaxy S5. Have had all of them. They keep getting better.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has awesome features. Great camera features, and everything is easy to use.

And the ease of organizing your apps and icons."
yes,no,yes,Prefer my iPhone like the seamless transfer of content and home automation apps
yes,yes,yes,I loved this phone before the most recent upgrade came along. Talk about ruining a great product in one simple download!!! It went from great to junk. I spend most of my time wanting to throw this thing over a bridge now. It is a piece of junk!!! I'm switching to I phone next time.
yes,yes,yes,My only complaint is that an update slowed down my phone
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love Samsung Products whether it's the phone, which I own, the 2 tablets, which I own, the beautiful French Door Refrigerator, which I own, or the awesome new Microwave that I just purchased."
yes,yes,yes,"I have used several brands of cell phones, but Samsung has been by far THE BEST. Easy to use, great features, good value, are just a few of the reasons to choose this phone. Batter life, and charge are second to none, and I am a junkie texter, game player, and facebooker."
yes,yes,yes,Long battery life and easy to use. Very durable also with a good case and screen protector. Love that it is waterproof.
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love the S5. I have had Samsung products every since I have had a cell phone and the S5 is defiantly the best by far. The screen is so brilliant and colorful and features are so easy and handy to use.
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone style with 2 different carriers and I love it. My husband has the black version and my sister wishes she had my phone. We love our phones.
yes,yes,yes,I love the clarity in sound and resolution from this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. I did have the cover for the charger port break, but it was quickly replaced. I really love this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I let my nieces and nephews play with it all tim, of course with my case. There always dropping it or banging it. It still runs great and does what it's suppose to."
no,yes,no,"I loved this phone until the update. It's now the most aggravating device I have to use on a daily basis. It gets hot, my battery is next to nonexistent in life, it constantly crashes, my screen is unresponsive more often than not, it is so freaking slow, and it likes to screen my phone calls for..."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung galaxy s5. The only con about this phone is that it's too large to fit in my pocket but, that doesn't really matter. The quality of the phone is amazing. I had the s4 prior to this and an iphone prior to that. Samsung is certainly my favorite and well worth the money."
yes,yes,yes,I really love my phone. It is so easy to use and has tons of features
yes,yes,yes,Great Phone to use on the go. As a merchandiser its features are spot on for road use and multitasking. Paired with the right apps everything I need to get done is at my fingertips.
yes,no,yes,Easy to see screen. I really like the sync feature.
no,yes,no,I tend to be particulary hard on electronics. I carry an static electic charge. Unless particulary well built they dont stand up to it very well. This product was no exception. I have had it for 4 months and have already had to have it replaced.
no,yes,no,"But, as it ages it's like every other phone and gets glitchy after 6 months"
yes,yes,yes,"My family, has become die hard Samsung owners. My husband owns the Galaxy S6. Both my teenage kids own the S4. I cannot rave more about my S5. I enjoy the sharing of videos and pictures with my family through the s beam capability. We all rave about our phones."
yes,yes,yes,"I am more than pleased with my Samsung Galaxy S5. It has everything I need and is capable of doing so many things which make my life easier. It's fast, sleek enough (even with a bulky case) to fit in my back pocket, durable, and easy to use."
no,yes,yes,I find myself having to reboot often. The phone overheats and freeze up. It did it even as I am typing this review.
yes,yes,yes,"I was so excited to get my Samsung Galaxy 5. Not long after I got it, I realized that some of my favorite apps would not work properly on this device. I was annoyed to discover that third party apps were no longer allowed to write to the sd card. This basically ruined my love for my new phone."
yes,yes,yes,Overall I love this phone. It has great qualities and beats other phones I have. The only thing I don't like as much is that the battery drains when playing games. I don't mind it because all phones have that problem. Everything else has been the best Ive ever had.
no,no,no,"After downloading the most recent update, I have experienced some issues with performance. And one major issue was the screen stopped working all together. Had to request a new phone through warranty as the screen just would not turn on without reason. Other than that, great phone."
yes,yes,yes,I love the Galaxy 5. So far I've had no issues with it (other than the fact that I lose them or they get stolen :[) ANDROID > iPhone. Always!
yes,yes,yes,"This is a one-up for me so similar to what I was using. So far only finding small differences but enjoying them so far. Like the camera and sound. Enjoying the messenging+, as well. Use the heart monitor as I use S-Health, too -- love this."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone with many features. Battery life is superb, only con is microphone isn't really clear. When I'm talking, people can't hear me as well as they did with my s3"
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung S5. Being connected to the Internet Face book and email along with phone and texting is awsome. Don't want to be without it.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my galaxy 5 so much, I love the great pictures I can take and the videos are super clear"
yes,yes,yes,I love how simple this phone is to use! I love the size and the features! I like it so much I convinced my husband to the get the new Samsung 5! We can help each other since they are basically the same phone! Would highly recommend this phone to a friend.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I was an iPhone user FOREVER and thought I would never own anything else. That is until I tried this phone. WOW! I love it so much more than the iPhone. I love that I can customize it. I love all the memory. No more error messages because of not enough space.
yes,yes,yes,I had a Droid phone before I got the galaxy s5 and I couldn't be happier I made the switch! This phone has everything I could want and need. The picture quality is amazing!
yes,yes,yes,"I've really enjoyed my S5, I've had it 4 months. One of my daughter's has the S5 and convinced me to make this selection for my personal use and I'm glad I did. I'm still learning about the features the S5 offers. I highly recommend it."
yes,yes,yes,"What I adore about the phone is the simplest feature of emergency contacting because I press my power button three times. This feature is the specific reason why I purchased it for grandmother. Of course, the finger swipe is nice and for me personally I've never had an issue."
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone for it's speed.It has great Apps and great directions - - I use many that I never used on other phones.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. I've had it for almost a year and it still works like it's brand new. I've already convinced my boyfriend to switch from iPhone to galaxy phones. It's fairly durable, it works fast, has lots of space on the phone, easy to use, and I love the nice big screen. This is a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is so much better than my S3. Much brighter screen which is easier on the eyes. Lots of new apps. Battery life is so good, one charge lasts 3 days. Lightweight."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! I like a lot of the good changes.
yes,yes,yes,Not being into the new technologies this phone has made me a believer that I was behind. I was a little skeptical at first but with the ease this phone let me setup and maneuver around the different apps it has become an instant success in my eyes.
yes,no,yes,"Switching from a Blackberry, which was just a tool for phone calls, tiny emails, and apointment tracking, my Samsung has become an integral part of my life. It tracks my progress towards a heathier lifestyle; wakes me up to go to work; keeps me on top of birthdays and appointments; catalogs photos..."
yes,no,yes,"I have enjoyed my Samsung Galaxy S5 for many reasons. There are many great features, the battery life is good and it has been easy to learn how to use the phone."
no,yes,no,This phone loads slow. It has been nothing but a disappointment after reading all of the glowing S4 reviews. Bigger battery does not result in longer usage time. Can't wait for my renewal date.
yes,yes,yes,"This is the first smartphone for me at age 59, believe it or not. I resisted due to the economy and having an extra monthly bill, because we have a home phone and did have a prepaid phone. But, I am so glad that I finally relented. I am still learning."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone! I never thought I would switch from an iPhone to an android but oh my gosh I am so happy I did!! There is so much more room in my Samsung s5, I feel like it's so much more compatible. It's my favorite phone yet!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I'll admit that I was an iPhone addict. I have a Mac computer, an have had several iPads. Have had continuous problem as the iPad would either shut down or go back to the main screen. The Galaxy has far exceeded my expectations of a tablet with so much more to offer."
yes,yes,yes,"I really love my Samsung galaxy s5.....I've never owned a phone that did so many cool things on its own, like grouping pics, making movies of pics, so many great installed programs that aren't just taking up space they are actually use able and interesting."
yes,yes,yes,This is the third smart phone and one of the best so far!! Just the right size for me and it provides all the necessary apps that I need for my phone! Always there and ready when I need it!! I also have the wireless cover for it which is an amazing addition too!! YUP!! Love this phone!!
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung has come out with another stellar product. I have a Samsung Galaxy s5 and it is absolutely amazing. Bright, vivid screen and colors. Fast, efficient system. Waterproof, which is a blessing, especially if you're clumsy or have kids. This phone is incredibly durable."
yes,yes,yes,The best thing about this phone is the ability to expand its internal memory with a SD Card. This feature alone was the reason I purchased this product over an iPhone.
no,no,no,Phone started out great but in less than 4 months it started over heating.
yes,yes,yes,This is the most awesome. Phone I've. Ever owned. I can do things I never new we're. Possible. It's. Easy to use and learn. I'm. So happy with this galaxy. S5. Thank you Samsung for a great product once again.

yes,yes,yes,I love my phone. I love the operating features and I love the ease of learning the perks to this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has a great looking interface, many great features, and a sleek new look. Would recommend getting a case for the phone, I had mine 2 days and dropped it and the corner became dented but other than the the dent no other damage so the phone is pretty tough but if you know you have buttering..."

yes,yes,yes,"I love the galaxy series. I have had the original, the s2, the s3 and now the s5."

yes,yes,yes,"While the iPhone is easy to use and learn, it's so BASIC.The S5 has endless capabilities that are fun, useful and easy to use."
yes,yes,yes,"I tend to treat this phone as an accessory to my Gear S watch, which I purchased at the same time.

yes,yes,yes,I have never seen so many features. The bubble preview that appears when you hover above a text message just blows my mind.
yes,yes,yes,"I could not wait to get my hands on the S5. it has everything that I need on it including the kid mode which is a life saver. The picture quality is fantastic, the actual size of the phone is perfect and it's fast enough for the social media that I do on my phone."
yes,yes,yes,I have really loved having this phone. I like the design and the performance.
yes,no,yes,"I'm pretty satisfied with my Samsung Galaxy S5. I had originally wanted the blue one, but I like the shimmery white too. I mean why should color really matter if you're going to put a case on it right?"
yes,yes,yes,Love my new Samsung 5 it's. Easy to use and love the camera takes awesome pictures.
no,no,yes,This is a very user friendly phone. I love the ability to customize just how I want when I want. (Even though I use a pure black background to supposedly conserve battery life. I am disappointed that the battery life is so poor.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is by far the very best phone I have ever owned. It's amazing! I love how it's completely customizable right down to the fonts. It fits me and my personality. The camera takes high quality very detailed pictures. (Better than any regular camera I have owned.

yes,yes,yes,"I am 62 and love the phone, but find it hard to understand, are they any instructions to this Galaxy phone 5 I could take or review something from the internet that would be easy to understand? Of course, I'm not from the computer age, however, I'm trying to understand."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone can't wait to get an s6,will be getting S6 as soon as upgrade is time...."

yes,yes,yes,"I was going to go for the latest and greatest - the S6 (not really thrilled with the Edge design), but after learning about the inability to replace the battery and add an SD card, I went for the S5. I read about all the issues with Lollipop on the S5, but figured I'll stay with KitKat."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone and plan to use it for quite some time... I got about 5 years from my last phone and I look forward to 5 with this one.
yes,yes,yes,Had an IPhone for several years then it just froze and shut down. Switched to the Galaxy S5 and could be happier!

yes,yes,yes,I really like Droid phones and the Samsung is possibly the most favorite. The phone is light and wide enough to see all the apps and pictures. I like how thin the phone is and how it slips into my pocket. I cannot wait to upgrade to the S6 because I am running out of space.

yes,yes,yes,Great phone for anyone. I enjoy all features and am able to use many sites.

yes,yes,yes,I love the light weight and special features. It's easy to move around. It doesn't have all the bugs my galaxy 3 notebook had. That phone I had to return 3 times. I'm still learning the new things like folders. I can see where Samsung is trying to make moving around apps windows easier.

yes,yes,yes,"This phone does everything I need. From taking, editing, and sharing photos, to calling and bluetooth. I can't think of anything I am unhappy about it.

yes,yes,yes,I love my phone. It is easy to use and navigate to apps. The battery does not have to be recharged all the time (about every other night for me). It is bright and easy to read. This phone is large and is not carried easily in a small purse or pocket.

yes,yes,yes,My first smartphone was the Galaxy 3. I loved that phone but after two years it just decided to die so I had to upgrade. I like the feature of a removable and replaceable battery so I opted for the Galaxy 5 rather than wait for the newer 6 which is more Apple in my mind.
no,no,no,"Very disappointed with battery life. I have to recharge during the day. From when I wake up in morning to 11:00 am, I am about 70%. Very disappointed. Tried everything in my power to fix this except get a new battery. I really shouldn't have to pay for it."

yes,no,yes,"The floating tool box makes it easy to get to my Calendar, Calculator, Camera and take Memos from any screen."
yes,yes,yes,I love Samsung products! I had an iPhone prior to this GalaxyS5. I would never go back! Samsung products are so user friendly. I have to Samsung tablets that are wonderful. Thus phone has excellent photo quality! To much to name.
no,no,yes,It does take awhile to operate all the features. My biggest problem is when connecting the phone to the charger. It is very difficult to slide the charger into the phone.
yes,yes,yes,I'm very impress with this Samsung Galaxy S5 have a lot of features and is easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,I am very satisfied with my Samsung device. It is very user friendly. I love the design and style
yes,no,yes,I went from an S3 to the S5 and love it. The only downside of the phone is getting used to the difference in the buttons. Other than that I have nothing bad to do say about this phone. I've already recommend it to three of my friends.
no,no,no,I was recommended by a friend to try this phone. Come to know this phones camera is poor quality. The camera doesn't take good photos at all. My photos came out blurry 90% of the time and i had photography training in college. I was really disappointed in it. The camera only good in the ads.
yes,yes,yes,"There is a slight learning curve for me. The new ""update "" to android 5.0 is disappointing. I don't so the value of it or the necessity for it. It takes away from the excellent graphics that were with the 4.4 version."
yes,yes,yes,"This product has great features, It should last awhile. Very happy with it."
yes,yes,yes,"Wonderful phone. This phone is very custamizable. the snapdragon processor is insanely quick. I have no complaints. The camera is very sharp, as well as the display. It trumps the apple product line. If you're looking for a phone look no further"
yes,no,yes,"I Had the very first Galaxy that came out, I loved it. I tried a coupe other brands between the S3 and the S5. Glad I tried them to realize how much I do love having a S5, the usability, style, comfort and phone itself are why I keep coming to Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,I have been an I Phone user for the last 5 years. Was talked into getting the Galaxy and glad that I was. Screen size is great and phone is faster then i thought. Wish I had bought mine before my wife bought her I Phone 6 because we would now then own 2 of them.
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone. Wish it was a little smaller. At full price, it is Very expensive."
yes,yes,yes,Great product! Loving my new phone! it's a really nice upgrade from my old Razr Maxx.
yes,yes,yes,this is my 2nd S galaxy phone. I had an S3 and now an S5. Transfer of data from one to the other was so easy I didn't need anything but the app that was suggested. I love to just sit down and find out what features I don't know about. It is loaded.
yes,yes,yes,"I can do virtually everything with this phone. All my bussiness, home and social needs. Thanks for a great product. I am sure there is more I can do but have not explored all of its features yet."
no,yes,no,"I have had 2 replacement phones sent to me. When I first got the S5 it was great, then it started acting up Verizon could not figure out why so they sent me a replacement, that phone did the same thing, so they sent me a 3rd phone."
yes,yes,yes,"To be honest the camera and reviews for the camera is the only reason I went wit this phone. Heart rate monitor is cool but hardly used, love the pedometer, battery life is awesome.... but the camera.... Grrrrr. It doesn't focus, won't take close ups of items and super blurry."
yes,yes,yes,"This is easily the best phone I've owned in my life. The battery has lasted between 24-34 hours with moderate usage, if the battery was all the way charged when you began. The design is beautiful and efficient, not too big or clunky even with a case on it, and the features are easy to use and..."
yes,yes,yes,"Overall, upgrading from a Galaxy s3 to the S5 was seamless, especially with the app that makes it happen in literally minutes, once you get past figuring out how to get it started. This was in April of 2014, so maybe they have improved the app since then..?"
yes,yes,yes,"I have had many phones, and this one is my favorite and best one yet. The screen is great the durability is great. ( my phone gets dropped a lot, my daughter and my nieces love to take my phone and watch videos and take pics)."
yes,yes,yes,I love my galaxy 5. Takes awesome pictures. I can do everything on it.
yes,yes,yes,"I just received this and I really impressed on the size of the screen as well as how it is a mini computer on the go, would recommend this over the I phone any day"
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first smartphone, and I love it! The only problem I've had was with the dust cover for the charger, which broke off early. I think it was flimsy. Other than that, it is a wonderful phone, with more features than I will ever learn to use. The camera is amazing!"
no,no,no,"I've had the GS5 for awhile now, and the only problem I have is opening the bottom charging area to plug in charger. This is due to my nails, so I usually have to use a pin, or paper clip to open it. In turn it is damaging the outer area."
yes,yes,yes,I needed an upgrade and heard many people talk about their Samsung S4 and how much they liked the phone. I lucked out and was able to get the S5 and I love it. I found it easy to set up thanks to the easy set up feature.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It charges super fast. I keep it on my night stand all night and charge it in the morning as I get ready for work. I love just saying ok Google and asking what I want and bam I have the right answer. The size has never been a problem. It works like a charm.
yes,yes,yes,Overall I love this phone. A week after I got it I had to do a factory reset on this phone because I couldn't download any apps to my phone ( and none of my other apps transferred into my phone). I also have a problem hearing people when on a call.
yes,yes,yes,I just replaced my Motorola Droid Razr Maxx HD with the Samsung Galaxy S5. I am thrilled with this new phone. The screen is bright and clear and just the right size. I love all of the features that are built in. S Voice beats the Apple version (Sirri). The ease of use is way ahead of the Droid.
yes,yes,yes,"This is an upgrade from the S3, and is quicker, easier to use and charges much faster. Lots less junk on it. Had to swap out the first one because the sound on phone calls didn't work (the real reason to buy a smart phone)!Great device."
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had this phone for about 3 weeks. All I can say is I absolutely love it! At first I was nervous about purchasing this phone, as a huge iPhone supporter. And I can tell you that I am not disappointed with my decision."
yes,yes,yes,"This has been the best phone i've ever owned or used. Those fruit phones do not compare, not ever in the same class! Support is soo easy. Cannot wait for the next big thing from Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,I love my Galaxy 5. The features alone will keep you busy all day. I have had my Galaxy 5 since May and i am still finding out things i didnt know it did.
yes,yes,yes,I switched from the iPhone 5c to this phone and I really like the galaxy s5 much better! The only issues that I have are the battery life and overheating. I can use my phone for an hour or so and it gives me the overheating warning and the battery lasts no time at all.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has lots of great apps. The phone is very easy to manage and easy to read.
yes,yes,yes,"I love everything about this phone, features, camera, app's! What more could a girl ask for! Long battery life and easy to use. Thanks Samsung, you're awesome!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love how you can go into the device and move things around or when it is hooked up to my laptop where I have my movies, I can just drag movies to the movie folder. Way easier than using Ipad cloud."
yes,yes,yes,Easy to use great features. Love my phone. Love so much bought one for my daughter.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone! I can charge my battery overnight, and it will literally last until about 11:00 that night! Thought it was a little wide at first but I got used to it in no time!"
yes,yes,no,"I had to upgrade from my S4, and am so glad I did!A lot of built in apps that I don't use, but can disable the notifications and on some ""turn off"".I am learning things about the S5 all the time = )"
no,no,no,"Sad to say but this is the worst phone I have ever had. I upgraded from the S4 and regret the day I did that. it has memory issues. ie. sluggish, super slow and freezes. I already replaced 3 (yes 3) phones and they are all the same. GARBAGE!"
yes,yes,yes,Great camera reallly fastbeats any iphone ever created
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone so much! I have a mac, and I love it, but I really just am not comfortable with iPhones, I prefer this one by far, and recommend it to anyone I know. Its fast, capable and has amazing capabilities. Its a perfect phone except for 3 small shortcomings..."
no,yes,yes,I loved my galaxy s5 until about 2 weeks ago. My phone was so fast and user friendly...but now it keeps freezing up and locking me out of my phone...very frustrating.
yes,no,yes,"Overall great phone (and not a bad tablet either)! The only thing that really does not work is finger print recognition, everything else is generally outstanding. The pattern recognition feature makes up for the poor finger print reader and is probably easier to use anyway."
yes,yes,yes,One of the best products of all time. Fast and reliable.
yes,yes,yes,"See above. Great phone, tremendous functionality.*****************************"
yes,yes,yes,"I LOVE this phone....best phone I've ever owned, love the screen and the fact that it's waterproof too!Plus I absolutely love it's camera... overall amazing phone"
yes,yes,yes,"My Galaxy S5 is speedy and very responsive. I could go from one app to another without any lag. Display is vivid and the rear camera captures vivid images with colors close to true colors. Size is taking a little time for me to get used to, but it is an awesome phone!"
yes,yes,yes,This is by far the best Galaxy phone to date. The features are amazing. The camera takes the clearest pictures I have seen on a phone or a camera. The only issue that I have had is connectivity with the Bluetooth in my car.
no,yes,yes,Good phone. Higher priced. Poor Battery life. Nice design. Fairly quick on apps.
yes,yes,yes,"Very pleased with my galaxy, i have owned a variety of phones and galaxy blows em all out of the water, not to mention, it is by my favorite company too. Keep it up samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,After 2 months of comparing I went with the Galaxy s5. The morning of the other phone being available I decided on the galaxy. My daughter bought her galaxy s5 back in June she loved/loves it. So I decided to give it a chance and I'm so glad I did.
yes,yes,yes,I got a new new galaxy 5 thought it was great so when the note 4 came out I thought I would like it more but nope I want my galaxy 5 back
yes,yes,yes,I switched from an iPhone 5 and love my new Galaxy S5. It has a great camera and has so many more customize-able options than my former phone. I am very happy I switched.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung Galaxy S5, the battery life far exceeds my previous phones, it looks great, is lightweight, and operates like a charm. The only thing I don't like about the phone is the new charging port, I can never just plug the charger in and at night it is a hassle without a light because it..."
yes,yes,yes,Best phone. Way better than the lastest iphone. All i buy is samsung.
yes,yes,yes,The camera on the Samsung S 5 is amazing. No matter where I am I always have the ability to take high quality pictures. The headphones that it comes with sound great. The only problem I've faced is running out of space due to taking so many pictures and videos. This truly is a great device.
yes,yes,yes,"I recently switched from an IPHONE 5 to the S5. The difference is amazing. I really thought I would miss the IPHONE, now I can't believe I actually owned one. The features of the S5 are truly well thought out and easy to use. There's a back button!"
yes,yes,yes,"After my last phone 2.5 years ago....which just blinked out performance wise and bad cell carrier...I was ready for an upgrade!I am a small business owner and needed a phone the had real 4G coverage and usage (Verizon).They have all the design to the T, and visibility of feature big bright and..."
yes,yes,yes,This is one remarkable phone. It has taken the place of my home computer and tablet except for watching movies. For that I like the bigger screen. It's like my best friend. I just talk to it and it does what I want. A lot of the apps work together which makes it a lot easier.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the Samsung Galaxy S5. The only thing I would change about it are the speakers, they are just not that loud. I have to keep the phone face down just to hear it when it rings or notifications."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had several smartphones and this phone definately is the best phone I have ever owned. In fact, we have four of the same phones on our wireless account. The durability of this phone is incredible, battery life on my Galaxy S5 is over two days and that is if I use it all day and if I don't..."
yes,yes,yes,#NAME?
yes,yes,yes,I had a original Samsung galaxy phone and held on to it for a 5 or 6 years and then finally got the Samsung galaxy s5 and will say it is the best choice I made. I have had iPhone in the past and and will say I will never have another iPhone as long as I can help it.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is very easy to use and has tons of apps that are free so no additional cost needed.
yes,yes,yes,Amazing you can do just about everything on your phone. Heart rate exercise you name it the phone can do it!!!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone so much...thank you Samsung for letting me use a remote on my phone because I'm lazy...
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great,so much better than the I phone.I love it. I want to get the bigger version like the galaxy 3 notebook"
yes,yes,yes,"In a time when a lot of truly amazing things are often taken for granted, Samsung upped the bar and delivered another level of awesome. The Samsung Galaxy S5 is absolutely the best smartphone on the market in terms of cost, performance, durability, and just about anything else you can think of.Some..."
yes,yes,yes,I first had IPhone 4 before I switched to the Samsung S5. This was no doubt one of the best choices I've made. One big difference I've notice was that the Samsung S5 is much bigger than my previous phone which makes it a lot easier to watch videos and read articles (geek person).
yes,yes,yes,"I like the way the phone handles and the size. still learning a few features, but over all like what I use."
yes,yes,yes,"Fingerprint reader is an awesome way to keep it secure. Camera produces great quality pictures and video. On screen keyboard is generous for big fingers while texting. Easily syncs with my car and watch. Great styling, performance, battery life and features. It is lightweight and easy to use."
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone and all the features. Fast and comfortable to hold.
yes,no,yes,"I love using this phone because it is very smart for anything i need it for, it only memorizes my finger print or two of my other friend's finger prints so it can be safely secured from anyone who seeks to steal my phone and i like the fact that it counts how many steps i take and tells me how many..."
yes,yes,yes,I would have too say that I love this phone. I wish I would of waited for the Samsung note 6. I like having a pen write things down. The only thing I am not fond of is the Google Play Store. They security doesn't work as good so my kids can just download anything
no,yes,yes,I have had this phone for a couple of months now and i have had no issues or problems.
yes,yes,yes,I went from a s3 to the s5. I love samsung and now love this phone. They sure out did themselves. It's better than any other phone I have had.
yes,yes,yes,"I've always had an iPhone. Was frustrated at the battery life, and it seemed like it took a long time to load anything. It was hard to chang, but am SO glad that I did. I love my S5!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I switched from an IPhone 5 to a Samsung Galaxy S5 after being so impressed with all of its features. The camera takes phenomenal photos that are easily viewed on the spacious screen, I love using the remote control app to control the channels and volume levels on my Samsung TV, and what's not to..."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone on recommendation from a friend. I was currently using an iphone at the time of purchase. I love this phone and fins the fratures.much better than iphone. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone.
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung Galaxy s5 cell phone it is so easy to use fast & speedy as well. Would not give up my Samsung for anything it's just perfect!
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone in every feature it has so much that I convince my husband to get the same phone but it in another color. I used to be an iPhone user I had an 5s there is no comparison this phone is way better.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought my Samsung Galaxy S5 in September of this year and I love this phone. I had a iphone 4 before this phone and hated ever since I had it. I have a galaxy tab 3, so this was a great addition to that."
yes,yes,yes,This phone changed the way I do most of my things. I'm coming from a different brand and this phone blows them out of the water. I can do things on this that I couldn't on the other. The hardware is the main reason I love this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Perfect sized phone for one handed operation. Excellent phone also.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is good looking &great features n easy to use.I am very happy with my new phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Love my Samsung S5. It is much faster, takes much better quality pictures. The screen is more clear. The app function is way better. They still need to work on the battery so it doesn't drain as quick as it does and also so it doesn't heat up so quick during minimal use."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first Samsung phone and I am very pleased with the performance and quality build of the phone. Brilliant screen, great battery life (even months later) and great performance."
yes,yes,yes,Just recently switched to a smartphone and was going to pick an iPhone. But after comparing smartphones I decided against the iPhone because the Samsung Galaxy offered so much more for the same price. I am so in love with my Samsung Galaxy S5.
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 great video picture, great battery life, very fast, I have owned other Samsung phone but this is by far the best."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my Galaxy S5 ...I went from an IPhone 4 to this phone.the camera is awesome with the 13 mega pixels great photos and videos! Easy to operate and user friendly apps! I'm so happy I chose this phone and highly recommend to anyone!
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone Ive ever purchased! Super fast, bright, light, and great reception!"
yes,yes,yes,The phone is better then the iphone and the iphone app gap is lessening. Would like a better camera. Also speakers on the front of the phone would make watching videos or TV more enjoyable.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is easy to figure out and has many features that are very helpful every day. Great resolution.
yes,yes,yes,"I had iphone prior to this phone, and honestly I like galaxy better than the iphone."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this phone now for about a month and love it however, I am baffled how phones now a days still can't handle more than half a dozen to a dozen apps. (Not pre-installed) Now a days there is apps for everthing and these phones can only hold a handful and still run well."
yes,yes,yes,I still have a lot to learn. I had an iPhone and it is way different but I will NEVER go back. The talk to text is not the greatest and I am still not liking the hands free yet. Overall I love it. I think after I become use to all of the features it will be fabulous.
yes,no,yes,I was nervous to go to the Samsung line because I was afraid that the battery may not be enough for me. (I had a super duper battery before) I have been very pleasantly surprised. The features are fantastic and the battery is working out fine! I couldn't be happier!
yes,yes,yes,"First bought a Samsung tablet , then a Smart TV, when the time came to trade in my cell I decided on Samsung based upon previous experience...love the product line developed by Samsung. As concerns the S5 the only ""con"" I have is battery life, although it's far better than my previous phone."
yes,yes,yes,Nothing i dont like. One of the best phones i have ever had and learning to use it is easy.
yes,yes,yes,"I used to love this phone when I got it, however after verizon's last update, it became really sluggish and useless."
yes,yes,yes,I am SO happy I switched back to Samsung! Don't know why I ever strayed away. Never again! From now on I will be forever sticking with Samsung devices.
yes,yes,yes,"Not only is Samsung known for great phones, they have a true iphone killer with the S5, 16mp camera and slim design."
no,no,no,When I got the phone I loved it. Now that I have it for less then a month I'm having problems with it. If the screen is turned off I push button to turn it on and it won't respond. Or a few times it has locked up and rebooted. I swipe the camera button on the lock screen and it won't open open.
yes,no,yes,Had an S3 first and loved it except for the short battery life. Recently got my S5 and I'm in heaven! The battery lasts me at least a day and usually more but the features have me really hooked. I LOVE the S HEALTH app that keeps me on track with walking.
yes,yes,yes,I have found my Galaxy S5 to be all I hoped it would be and MORE!
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy this smartphone a lot it's very easy to use the music apps are very useful and video is unbelievable
yes,yes,yes,"Wouldn't have any other phone. Fast, nice camera, and believe it or not it does have some durability to it."
yes,yes,yes,Love it! The only downfall I see is the charging port door and having to open and close it all the time but I can handle as the rest of the phone is purely phenomenal! The camera takes great pictures! The accessories for the phone are great as well!
yes,yes,yes,"I've had my S5 for about 3 months now, and it still is an incredible ""hand-held computer""! This thing is SO fast. 'Seems to do everything very well.As a computer geek, I'm seriously considering getting rid of some of my computers. 'Don't really need them with the S5."
yes,yes,yes,I like the galaxy s5 a lot better than the iPhone but the pictures are not as fast as the iPhones were! But when they do take they are great but sometimes blurry....... But overall it is a great phone!!!
yes,no,yes,I thought this device would blow me away. I didn't.. I feel that the screen size could be better.... some of the features are unecessary.... I feel that the multiwindow should allow you to do more things like browse internet and play a game or be on YouTube and play a game for example..
no,no,no,I must reboot the phone at least once per week. You said this is too short but I believe it completely describes the problem and I am just wasting time typing this.
no,yes,no,The phone comes with a littany of useless and superfleous apps that a user cannot delete;
yes,yes,yes,"samsung galaxy s5 is the best phone ever ,nice display size , nice color and great camera for photos also tons of features,recommend this over IPHONE anyday!!!"
yes,yes,yes,I'm still learning all the cool features. The kids mode is by far the best thing ever invented. The games are all educational. My 20 mth old grandson in 1 week has learned colors n numbers. Best thing is all Free. My daughter and son in law is now trading in iPhone for Samsung S5.
yes,yes,yes,I love it I still have to learn all the functions but so far is great! I love the Camara it takes great pictures to. And on the space bar you can choose the lenguaje.
yes,yes,yes,Have had several smart phones from different companies over the years. Was initially waiting on new I phone. So glad I did not! LOVE THE PHONE!
yes,no,yes,This is my first Samsung Galaxy phone and I would purchase another in the future.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, love the features. Came with some great apps, also like Samsung Galaxy Essential"
yes,yes,yes,I purchased this phone to replace a 3 year old Droid with a slide out keyboard. I was nervous that I would have difficulty texting due to not having the keyboard and boy was I wrong. No problems at all right out of the box. It integrated all of my contacts and apps from my Droid with no issues.
yes,yes,yes,I really like the Samsung Galaxy S5 it has a lot of great features I use on a daily basis. The only thing I've noticed is the battery doesn't hold a charge like it use to. Also if your in and out of wifi range it changes to 4G a little slow so it makes performance a little slower.
no,yes,no,"After connecting to all my accounts and pictures and videos, phone is slow."
no,yes,yes,"Too many kinks for a flagship phone that still need worked out, even after post Go Live firmware update. I had the first S5 for less than 2 weeks and it kept freezing up, so Verizon exchanged. Otherwise, I've had to research online to get help with ways to release contention with RAM, etc."
yes,yes,yes,Fell in love with Samsung because of this phone wish the next release is even better
yes,yes,yes,"I LIKE MY SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 MORE THAN AN IPHONE BECAUSE IT HAS A BIGGER SCREEN, COOLER FEATURES, HAS A BETTER BATTERY LIFE AND YOU CAN GET TO THE BATTERY"

yes,yes,no,The more I do the more I learn. This phone does everything but but roll over and play dead. Because it will speak.
yes,yes,yes,"I LOVE MY Samsung Galaxy S® 5 in Shimmery White. This phone is GREAT, IT DOES EVERYTHING I WANT AND NEED IT TO DO. I am glad I made this purchase, I haven't had any problems or issues with it. I RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO EVERYBODY."
yes,yes,yes,Love this tablet. I use it everyday. Great value too!
yes,yes,yes,My Galaxy S5 was a replacement for a Note. Took some time for me to get used to the smaller size. After I did I really like it. I really like Samsung products.
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone! ! Great photos and awesome apps!! My 1 year old daughter loves watching her favorite shows while we go on trips or just to the grocery store. Light weight but durable
yes,yes,yes,I am so glad I picked Samsung s5......I love the ease of use....and everything about it
yes,yes,yes,"I love the window view cover. It let's you see your text messages incoming as well as setting it up to what you want to see like picture, weather, steps, etc. The sharp graphics make pictures so clear and beautiful. My husband already had the S4 so I new I would like the S5."
yes,yes,yes,"Good Morning! This device is awesome, the picture quality is stupendous, the speed is fast, the features are wonderful, and the design is very cool! I love this phone and have recommended it to everyone I know! Thank you!"
no,yes,yes,The only feature I don't like is the new Contacts list won't let you see the details in Favorites. It goes directly to calling the contact. Don't know how to change that.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has a great lasting battery, it has great speed. The camera takes amazing pictures and videos."
yes,yes,yes,"I would not have anything else! I'm a Galaxy girl all the way!! No other phone compares to it's great features, and easy to operate! !"
yes,yes,yes,"New to this type of phone. Found it easy to use, intuitive and fun learning."
yes,yes,yes,Let me start off by saying I've always been an iPhone user. It was until a couple months ago that I wanted a change and I'm happy I did because I purchased the galaxy s5. It has so many great features that I use everyday and I can't believe that I've stuck with iPhone for so long and have been...
yes,yes,yes,Where should I start? I have never had a phone as wonderful as this one. Every feature is a delight to work with. I am constantly amazed at the technology they put into this marvel of electronics.
yes,yes,yes,"I have an iPhone 5S at work and when it was time for me to purchase my own personal cellphone, I decided to go with the Samsung Galaxy S5 because it has features that the iPhone doesn't have.* Larger screen - love this for watching moviesOverall, I love the Samsung Galaxy S5."
yes,no,yes,"I bought this phone on a contract upgrade back in July, and after 2 months of mid-heavy daily use, I can say that I still have ""WOW"" moments with the Samsung Galaxy S5. Whether it be the INSANE 16-megapixel camera, the incredible 5.1"" Super AMOLED display, or the finger-blazing speeds from the..."

yes,yes,yes,"It's my first Samsung Mobile, I feel good with this."
yes,yes,yes,"I have been discovering new things about this product on a daily basis. Everything was easy to transfer from my S4 to my new S5. Navigating the new changes took a couple of minutes but once I got it, everything fell into place. I also discovered that my child could figure more about it than me."
yes,yes,yes,I have had both an iPhone and Android phones and this is by far my most favorite phone I've ever had! There are so many features that I love and I'm sure some I haven't even discovered yet!
yes,yes,yes,"So far I have and no real issues with this phone. The only change I would make would be to allow for a change in font color. If you place a light colored desktop or screensaver, you cannot see the text."

It is a lot quicker and offers more options than the iphone. I will never switch back to an iPhone! #lovegalaxys5
no,no,no,"It's NOT waterproof because the charging cover has a mini plastic clip that covers the charging port, breaks off from normal wear. In fact, I didn't even know the clip was there until my charging cover wouldn't stay shut. I visited a Verizon store and the employee there showed me why!"

yes,yes,yes,"I had a Droid but this S5 I love. Updates, service all of it"
yes,yes,yes,I am a big fan of the Droid operating system. This phone is such an improvement over my last phone. The battery can go up to 3 days without recharging it and I use it quite a bit.

yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, I like the desing, the camera and is easy to use even for my kids."
yes,yes,yes,"Really like the look and feel of the phone, just wish you had left things how they were on the previous version for the settings. Lightweight, big screen, slim. I barely use all the features available. The best thing you could add would be a screen you could see in the sun."

yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S5 has all the features you can ask for in a cell phone...It's like have your personal computer in the palm of your hand... So if your looking to upgrade your cell phone, The Galaxy S5 is the way to go..."
yes,no,yes,Beter batter life. I also feel that the apps lost their creativity .

yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy 5 is an average phone in comparison to all others on the market. I haven't really found anything in the past 3 months that it can do that any other phone couldn't do. In saying that, there could be some things that I don't know the phone can do yet."
yes,yes,yes,It was a very hard decision to even think about switching from my iPhone. I have no regrets. My entire family is on iOS devices so I used that as an excuse not to switch. AGAIN... I AM SO HAPPY I DID. This phone does everything that I want and need and then some.
yes,yes,yes,Love my Samsung.. find something new on it all the time!
yes,yes,yes,I have enjoyed the fact that I need not worry about a little moisture destroying my phone. The camera works great and I was able to expand the memory of the phone. I have yet to use up the battery in a day and that has been great.

For 1 it over heats fast, 2 the battery doesn't last, 3 it's should come wit a manual on hown to use all the features even though I love trying to figure it out this phone is good just needs some tweaking here and there and it..."

yes,yes,yes,I love the larger screen... put my iPhone 5 in the desk drawer and have never looked back.

no,yes,no,"After owning this phone for only 2 months when you type, it will lag behind sometimes up to 10 seconds. I had my old phone for 2 years before that started happening, so I hope I don't regret this purchase. In fact, it this time, it is over 1 sentence behind my typing."
yes,yes,yes,"When upgrading I choose the Galaxy s5 over an iPhone because of camera reviews. I am pleased with the camera, but the size of the phones somewhat awkward.

yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone if you wanna keep track of your health and creates very good videos
no,no,no,"I'll start with the bad and finish with the good. I was hoping to find a S5 with 32GB of storage but it was impossible to find at all the Verizon retail stores I looked at to trade in my S4 for the S5, and I didn't wan't to have them order it and wait because I'm not a patient person plus I was..."
yes,yes,yes,"All the essential functions plus more kool design only drawback is s fitness, why do I need to know my heart rate"
yes,yes,no,It is a phenomenal phone but it has one problem and that is the water resistant thing because when I dropped in water I was lucky I still had a phone because he got to my Sim card and battery
yes,yes,yes,"Don't want to repeat others about how great the S5 is, so I'll only state the one problem I have: Sound! The highest setting speaker volume is much lower than other phones I have had and I can't enjoy music or trust the alarm to wake me. Wish there was a fix for this."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is an amazing phone. First of all, I am a middle aged woman that is not too tech savy. This phone made the transition to it very easy.

yes,yes,yes,"Formerly, I was an iPhone only smartphone user. I loved my iPhone but started getting bored with it. It worked great, but just became boring. Upgrade time came and I went to the Verizon store for once to see what options there were and was drawn to the Samsung line."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is absolutely amazing. To give a context of how this phone compares to others in the past - In my personal opinion, early versions of Samsung phones from several years ago were not the best (ex. Samsung Fascinate/Mesmerize, Droid Charge/Aviator)."
yes,yes,yes,"PC...gone, laptop......gone! Between my Samsung 2014, 10.1 Note and my S5 mobility takes on a whole different persona, and no wrong I can't write."
yes,yes,yes,I love my S5!!!! It works great and fast without any delay which is great for my active lifestyle. I use the fitness features all of the time on my phone and they work great. If you are going to own an android phone the Galaxy S5 is most definitely the way to go.
yes,yes,yes,Great device. So many uses beyond just a phone. Highly recommended.
no,yes,no,"I got my new Verizon S5 about 4 weeks ago. It totally died and could not be turned on. Took it back to the Verizon store and they had no idea what was wrong with it.Verizon sent me a new phone, will see how this one does."
yes,yes,yes,"I have thus far owned the s3, s4, and now the s5. The s5 is by far the best of these. Love the fingerprint scanner as it really works well. I enjoy the other apps on it. The only things i wish were different is that the menu button would still be to the left of the home key, like in the s3 and s4."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the Samsung I know and love. I upgraded from an S3 to this phone. It's a fantastic upgrade. The speed, the size, the design, the features, all of these things make this one of the most superior cell phones out there today.Now for the ""almost perfect"" part."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone decent build and durable over all very satisfied
yes,yes,yes,Great battery life if you keep some applications from running all the time. Screen size and clarity of images are superior. Impressed with camera and video quality. Still learning the finer aspects of navigation.
no,yes,no,"Have found the S5 to be an indispensable companion for the day. It provides assistance at work, while I'm on the go by foot, and while at home. I am consistently impressed by its battery life and that even while walking outside in the hot sun using an Otterbox case, it doesn't get very hot."
yes,yes,yes,I love the camera. It is easy to use. It starts us so fast it is unreal. I love the workout apps available for it.
yes,yes,yes,Nice Fit Sharp and on Time

yes,yes,yes,"Don't have any other smart phones to compare this phone to. I absolutely love all the features on this phone. The size of the phone is perfect, not to small, not to large. I am continuously learning new things on a daily basis on this phone. The technology blows my mind."
yes,yes,yes,"In the past, I had a Galaxy III. Battery life was miserable. Usually by mid-day I was at 50%, and near 3% by early evening. I went back to my iphone. Well, I have gone back to the Samsung and got the S5. What an improvement! The battery now lasts till bedtime, with percentage to spare."
yes,no,yes,I have the white Galaxy S5 and also bought the S4 when it came out. Camera produces great quality pictures and video but camera is slow when first activated compared to my iPhone 5s. Size is good and print very legible. S Health Pedimeter is not accurate but works a OK.
yes,yes,yes,"Photos are fabulous. Ease of use exciting. Only one thing, clasp where charger plugs in, won't stay closed. This is bothersome. Otherwise I love it."
yes,no,yes,I am enjoying my galaxy 5. Before I had an I phone and the galaxy is much easier to use and has more options. It doesn't have the limitations. Also if I have a problem with the phone I don't have n to take it to apple. I live in a very rural area.
yes,yes,yes,"Water poof for sure, great camera shots, & light.."
yes,yes,yes,"I love these features (in no particular order): the quadcore processor, great screen, MIMO WiFi, SD card, removable battery, waterproof, KitKat, 16 GB camera, size and battery life.Only dislike is the 16 GB of memory the device comes with and the restrictions on moving apps to the SD drive."
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone yet. Learning new options all the time. Very user friendly.
yes,yes,no,"As soon as I bought the S4 in June 2013, I soon started hearing the news about the S5. After waiting, not so patiently, it finally came & Samsung did not disappoint with this phone. I could not be happier."
yes,yes,yes,I just think that there are a lot of glitches and that they could have kept some services the same. .it's kinda difficult to figure out fully. Well the features and what not. I do however enjoy my phone and do not regret the purchase.
yes,yes,yes,Pros: To me the phone is nice and has a good feel and visual appearance. I like the visual display fonts size and modifications you can make. Really a good job on that. Plays videos very well. and the Kies PC software you get with this is great.
no,no,no,I have only had the S5 for about 4 weeks. I have had to replace the phone because at the bottom the homekey and back key stopped lighting up. Dont know why it quit working.
yes,yes,yes,"I am an android person. Tried an iPhone but couldn't get used to it. I did like some of the iPhone features & was pleasantly surprised to see the Samsung Galaxy s5 has them! So far, I love it!"

yes,yes,yes,I had many Samsung phones but this phone is perfect haven't had any problems...
yes,yes,yes,I love my galaxy s5! The best phone I've ever owned!

yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone! The battery life is good, the graphics and ease of use is better than I'd hoped. Love love love it!!"
yes,yes,yes,"Upgraded from an S3 I had for Almost 2 years that is a great phone. The S5 is faster, feels lighter, water proof which is big plus. Definitely happy with the upgrade."
yes,yes,yes,This phone has what I was looking for in a phone. It is fast(quad core) and has great battery life.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is one of the best phones I have ever purchased. I am so happy I decided on it. The phone is very user friendly, easy to figure out. If I didn't know how to do something I was able to find a quick answer on google. My favorite feature about the Galaxy S5 has been the amazing camera."
no,yes,no,This phone is horrible. The ear piece has so much static that people have difficulty hearing me. The swipe to answer feature is not as sensitivite as the rest of this idiotic phone. Buyer beware.
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung Galaxy s5. It takes super pictures. You can zoom in on something hundreds of yards away. The colors are so vivid and there is such detail. I also love the fact that I can play games without them freezing up (like they did on my previous phone).
yes,yes,yes,"I was a apple user, all I can say is never again!!!!This thing is Awesome. The only thing that would make it better is something like Suri. Its faster great pictures and even audio sounds better."
yes,yes,yes,"Love, love, love. Best phone I ever had. Owned for less than a month but already the ease of use is obvious."
yes,yes,yes,"The over all experience of this phone is good. I wish that it wasn't as slow loading up of the apps. I really like the design of it. The heart rate monitor feature is amazing and accurate. The camera on this baby is amazing as well. It has acted up a little on me, but nothing major."
yes,yes,yes,This is my first smartphone & I absolutely love it!!
no,yes,no,The phone has a lot with in it! I am enjoying this every single day. I keep learning new things that the phone can do everyday. The phone states that it is waterproof. I DROPPED it in a sink of hot soapy water and the phone was fine. nothing wrong with it.
yes,no,yes,I have had my galaxy s5 for a few days and I am absolutely loving how veritable it is. You can customize it and it is so fast and easy to use. I am still learning the camera which is good but can be finicky if lighting isn't just right.
yes,yes,yes,The S5 is the best phone on the market.......really can't understand why anyone would want an iphone since the Galaxy line was introduced? Call quality is great.....apps and functions are awesome.
yes,yes,yes,The only downside to this device is that it cannot be connected to more than one Bluetooth device at a time. My last phone could be connected to my vehicle and my earpiece
yes,no,yes,"The Galaxy S5 has surpassed all my expectations. It is fast, has brilliant colors and awesome apps to boot! If you are on the fence about buying this, don't delay. I love it. I'm so happy that I did not buy the I Phone. My only con is the price."
yes,yes,yes,"I've been using the Galaxy 5S now for a few weeks. Its a great phone, I highly recommend it. The picture is clear, its quick and responsive. The touch screen is more accurate and sensitive than my last model by far. The reception is better and data speed seems quicker too."
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love this phone! This is truly the BEST PHONE I have ever had!!!!! Great job Samsung, keep up the excellent work!!!"
no,no,yes,You touch one button and you are there.You dont have to wait for things to down load..
yes,yes,yes,So I went from an iPhone to the galaxy s5 and wow...if apple wants to compete they better step their game up! The s5 if freaking awesome! I love all of the features and it's durability! It's so fast compared to my iphone..which is notorious for force closing apps and freezing!
yes,yes,yes,So far the phone has done everything i thought it would do. i like the waterproof part i have not dropped it in water yet but i will text and be on the phone while its raining is nice to know that i dont have to worry
yes,yes,yes,this is my first Samsung smartphone and I love it. it has awesome features on it. Like you can voice text and send and the person can here your voice . they do not have to read .
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone ever. I rarely use my Kindle anymore forget about computer.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is fun. The picture quality is excellent. I thought it would confuse me because of my age (over 55), but that is not the case. I am enjoying learning its features. I purchased the charging dock and that is just wonderful."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm a Verizon store manager, so I know phones. I was also an iPhone user for the last 5 years (most recently the iPhone 5S). Having the chance to play with the new Galaxy S5 before it's launch, I was hooked."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone! It takes great pictures, it is easy to use and the screen is nice an big! The picture is so clear. This is my first samsung product and I am hooked! I just love it! Now I want a tablet too!"
yes,yes,yes,"Yes, a real smart phone!! Had an iphone, great if you are just looking for a basic phone. My new Samsung galaxy 5 is 10 times better. Sound, images, speed and you can easily find everything."
yes,yes,yes,It is a great device. Have had a Samsung for over 5 years and each model has gotten better and better. The gs5 is a great design and a fun device overall. If you like taking pictures the 16mp camera will amaze you. Overall I love the device and if you are thinking of owning one you should.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome. Occasionally it doesn't bring up my emails. ..just a white screen. I like the fingerprint lock and the pedometer. Camera is great.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has been awesome so far but I wish it had the ability to trace itself with out letting my phone know I'm tracing it, and I have to hold my hand over one side of the unit to experience good sound at full volume"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is easy to use. The battery has a long life. It has car mode which is a major safety feature.
yes,yes,yes,I am so happy with my new Galaxy S5. The screen display is stunning. The sharpness and colors are great. It works rapidly and I have not had any problems. The ease of the menus is wonderful.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has all the updated features that make life easier. Not only is it easy to navigate with, but having features that make it resilient to spills or that quick drop in the sink make it GREAT!"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is amazing in what it can do. The probelm is it is more complicated to figure out all those great features and how to use them to their greatest potential. Some are easier as I have used a smartphone, but others I have to play with too much and end up just frustrated."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this new phone for a week, (upgraded from the S4). So far I am impressed with the increased battery life and the quality of the camera/video. I was a little disappointed to find that it is still limited in color, and they don't offer a wide array of colors in the protective covers, but that..."
yes,yes,yes,"Got it yesterday and havent put it down yet. Screen size, app response time, health app, the list just goes on and on. Finally i am completely satisfied with a phone."
yes,yes,yes,I got my Galaxy s5 as a mother's day gift and i have really enjoyed it. The camera is really good and its suppose to be water proof though i haven't tested the fact i love the idea. Great phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, it is a little bit slower than my last phone, but I am overall very impressed, my favorite it the fitness app already included on my phone, I can't wait to find out more things about this phone since I switched from a iphone, great upgrade."
yes,yes,yes,"Overall I really am glad I bought this phone, one of the main selling points for me was the fact that it is water and dust resistant. I have dropped this phone plenty of times in the shower while listening to I Heart Radio, and even in the tub a few times and everything still works as good as the..."
yes,yes,yes,This phone has so much to offer.Totally Satisfied Owner of the Samsung Galaxy S 5
yes,yes,yes,"I have had some bad phones in the past, but this phone is amazing by all means! The colors, the sharpness of the screen, the feel of the phone- I can't rave enough about it! I have been trying to convince all my friends to get one."
yes,yes,yes,I only had one other smartphone and I really enjoyed it. It was time for my upgrade and I had heard and read so many wonderful things about the Galaxy 5 I decided to look into it as well as one other smartphone that I had heard and read about.
yes,yes,yes,"It might just be ....features, aps.,design. And ease of use....I vote yes. ......"
yes,yes,yes,I'm glad i made the best switch ever to samsung from iPhone. Samsung and it's interface has been very amazing for my needs with personal life and business.
no,no,no,"The ONLY problem I have experienced so far with this phone is the battery failing me daily. I can't get through half the day without having the phone die. I have to carry a charger at all times, which is not always manageable.I have had the S3 and S4 with no battery issues whatsoever."
yes,yes,yes,Had the iPhone 4s and hated it. I love design of this phone. Also love the camera and the Android system.
yes,yes,yes,I have had my galaxy s5 for about three weeks now and I have to say hands down this is the best cell phone I have ever owned. I love everything about it. The response time is awesome when surfing the net. The features are incredible. I love the look (shimmery white) of the phone itself.
yes,yes,yes,"I have now owned my phone for a few months. I generally prefer running products thru the paces before reviewing them. Excellent display, very clear, images are crisp, and detailed. The volume of the external speaker is loud compared to other phones I've used."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent! My first love of Samsung was the flip phone with another carrier.. I went from the S4 to the S5.. Thank you for the upgrade to the camera!!
yes,yes,yes,"This phone was given to me without my knowledge and apprently it was also a grad gift from my mom. Anyways, this phone is the first product I've had from Samsung and I have to say that it's really great ^_^ (I'm even writing this review on my phone) ."
yes,yes,yes,"i have fallen in love with samsung, this phone is amazing! love the battery life, the bright screen, the water resistance. overall amazing phone!"
yes,yes,yes,All I have to say is the camera is one of the reasons I traded my s4 to the s5. I love the way it focuses on the object or view I'm trying to take.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It's easy to navigate plus it has so many extras features. I like how easy it is to use. My techy son instantly took it away from me to see how different it is from his Samsung Galaxy S4. Thanks Samsung!!
yes,yes,yes,The Best phone in the market!!! I will recommend SAMSUNG to my friends!
yes,yes,yes,"Basically the title already explains it. I am on my family vacation and I had my phone in my swimsuit. I'm only 17, so I guess I could say I'm still a little unresponsible. I was at the beach for almost all day, lost my phone about 50 yards out into the ocean. With only a regular rubber case."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has so far exceeded my expectations. I am very pleased with the general quality, dynamic display and ease of use and learning new features."
yes,no,yes,Thank you Samsung! I'm a business man again and kicking but at work.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Galaxy S5! Both my husband & I got the same phone, so glad we purchased!"
yes,yes,yes,highly recommend the large screen and I am impressed it is waterproof but I have not tested that
yes,yes,yes,"I am not a pro when it comes to phones. Honestly, my phone prior was the Pantech Breakout and this one is AMAZING compared to that one. First off, memory! Lots of it, plus I have more on the SD card. Clarity is great. Phone lasts forever."
yes,yes,yes,I have had both the s4 and the note 3 and I am very happy with my new s5. The phones updated features and new durability are definitely a winning combination. I would recommend this phone to anyone I meet as anyone who has met me already knows
yes,yes,yes,I just switched from the Windows phone to the SGS5. This is my new baby!! It helps me stay on track with health and fitness. Love the picture quality. I could go on. Best phone yet!!
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone on the market today, very easy to use and adapt to. I have had three friend go out and buy one. I have tested the waterproof capability and it passed, however it does take a second to register your finger prints due to the screen coiling down."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone has yet to give me any problems, I like the look of it, although I wish I could've had the blue one, I have white, I think it looks better than black or gold!"
no,yes,yes,This phone is nothing but Samsung having customers pay for apps....we can't use any storage drives other than the 16 GB that came with the phone. I brought a 32 GB SD card and can't use it at all. What is the point of this phone .
yes,yes,yes,"A nice phone to have. Amazing Camera, speed and very resourceful. Battery life is great with power saving mode. The Screen does a fine job in the sunlight. Feels great when you hold it. The only con i can think of is there is no ""Download Booster"" with Verizon."
yes,yes,yes,"Easier than the S3 or S4. I have trouble puting it down. However, you must buy a cover of some sort, or the first time you drop it, it's all over but the crying."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone!! It is easy to use, great features and takes the most amazing pictures!!"
yes,yes,yes,I am very satisfied with this phone. It has great features and customizability! I enjoy that I have the option to carry a spare battery and swap it out when needed; no need to be tethered to a line attached to a wall. This S5 phone does everything I want it to do.
yes,yes,yes,"I am in love with this phone. I love the customization capabilities. I can really make this ""me."" Keep up the great work. I look forward to future products."
no,no,yes,"The switch from LG to Samsung was dramatic!! I was very happy with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 but size wise it was way to big for my jeans front packages..:) The only complain with my new S5 is that freezes a lot and gets ""very"" hot; even with non of my downloaded apps running...."
yes,yes,yes,I recommend this phone to all my friends and it looks like all of them are joining our galaxy family ;)
yes,yes,yes,My Galaxy s5 outshines an IPhone any day. I love mine.
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 is easy to use if you're coming from another smartphone. The ease of touch for commands is quick and the audio response to commands is fantastic. The camera takes great pics. There's so many features, I'm still learning but i love my S5."
yes,yes,yes,Very friendly and easy to use. An excellent product!!!!
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my S5. I don't know what took me so long to come around. I had a RAZR maxx prior to my S5. The screen is phenomenal. The camera takes the best pictures. I'm never going back.
yes,yes,yes,I had a hard time deciding between this phone and the HTC M8. I really glad I went with this one. There is really not much I can say that I don't like about it.
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone 2 weeks ago and it blows the Droid razor Maxx out of the water. I have had 5 different apps running at one time and this phone showed no hesitation when processing or switching between them. Only drawback is the battery life could be better.
yes,yes,yes,"The s5 is a wonderful phone. I love the camera on it! Lots of neat features such as the heart rate monitor, group play, and kids mode. The display is lovely and easy to see in bright or dim lighting."
yes,yes,yes,"Is a pretty good cell phone,good design, awesome features, and my kiddo love it!"
no,yes,yes,"Someone stole my phone the second day I had it, and now I'm waiting on Verizon's insurance company (asurion), to get my claim through, I'll edit this review when I can actually possess the phone for more than 24 hours."
yes,yes,yes,"I truly love this phone. As my contract renewal approached, I had really planned on getting a new iPhone, until the new S5 was announced. The screen size of the S5 really won me over, as did the specs. I want a phone I can actually see and the display is gorgeous........"
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone....at work we all have updated to this phone...-
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great, I'm still learning about the different features"
yes,yes,yes,By far the best phone I've ever had! The quality and look of the phone are one of the best!
yes,yes,yes,this is my first smart phone... seems like a good phone so far.
no,no,no,"I was just sitting there and then randomly my gs5 turns off and deletes all of my data. So I just decided to restart it and try to get my data back on. After at least an hour of trying to turn it back on and trying to fix it, it does the same thing again.My friend had it worse."
yes,yes,yes,"No matter how many Samsung phones I own, I'm always surprised with the thoughtful and innovative technologies they manage to cram into their phones. Samsung has done it again with this sleek, feature rich mobile device that brings my work productivity to the next level.I've had the phone for a few..."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone overall is great. The battery lasts along time. I use my phone as a hotspot at work, which is pretty much on while I'm at work. Still the battery lasts over 24 hrs."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is stunning. The design is very sleek and modern. The layout is user friendly and easy to learn. Performance is very fast and the camera/video images are beautiful.
yes,yes,yes,love the phone better than the s4 only issue is im assuming that being so new is why socialmedia apps crash and freeze up a lot. also home screen and camera do the same hopefully and update will be out shortly to correct these issues.
yes,yes,yes,I have no complaints. Samsung never disappoints! I've been with the galaxy family since the first one!
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy S5 has lots of features. Very fast loading things.
yes,yes,yes,"This is honesty the best phone I have ever owned. It is beautifully designed, amazing fast and super light weight for its size. You can't eve begin to appreciate it till you can hold it in your hands and use it. Samsung thanks! :D"
yes,yes,yes,"I've been with Apple phones for the last three years, and blackberries before that. This phone is SO much better. Such a step up. Finally I don't have the slowest, oldest, ugliest phone in the group, in the office, in the family!This phone was easy to learn how to use."
yes,yes,yes,Bought ours on the 11th when it came out I love it so much I love how big the screen is in this design they're are a couple new apps on here which is pretty awesome I would recommend this to every one.
no,yes,no,"The S5 I received for Christmas worked for two weeks before the screen went black and stayed that way. It hasn't been dropped or mishandled in anyway; In fact, it's protected with an Otterbox case. There's really no reason it should have failed already."
yes,yes,yes,THIS ONE IS BEST YOU'VE MADE. S-6 & 7 need serious WORK !! BEFORE I UPGRADE AGAIN
no,no,no,"Would not update. Continually crashed. Would not connect to service, data, or receive calls."
yes,yes,yes,I love the crisp imsge and performance. Grest for mobile gaming
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great haven't had any problems. And it takes great pics.
yes,yes,yes,"As an owner of four previous Samsung phones, I have consistently been pleased with each new iteration of their Galaxy series phones.

yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome, all my products are Samaung, you can sync all your devices, I love it :)"
yes,yes,yes,I've owned two iphones both worked great but eventually started having issues. My contract was up with my rural carrier thats not listed here (bluegrass cellular). I love the camera feature on my phone. Battery life is much much better for my GalaxyS5 then it was for either of my iphones.
yes,yes,yes,I recently bought this phone and haven't been able to put it down yet. There is a lot to set up because I know know that my life now revolves around this phone. You can put in all your information and infuse it with apps to make your life so much easier.
yes,no,yes,"In general,I like de pone, you have all the funcionality.Best regards.Gustavo"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is really amazing, fingerprint, qaulity screen lightening, motion sensors but the only problem is that I have not yet received the android 5.0 version, please someone help me."
yes,yes,yes,"As usual another great phone from Samsung the only thing I don't like is I cannot put my own tune on messaging shame but that is just a small niggle have been using it for 3 months now and cannot fault it easy to use, just a great phone"

yes,no,yes,"Phone was a pretty good deal -- my first ever. I find the power button is in exactly the wrong place, so whenever I'm turning or fumbling with it it powers off or on. I intensely dislike the loss of privacy with all the apps and was shocked when some kind of 50MB upgrade to Google Play or Apps came..."
no,no,no,The phone was advertised as unlocked. In fact the phone is locked with verizon ànd cannot be used
yes,yes,yes,Excellent- love it
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product
no,no,yes,The bottom left part of the screen is raised/coming off for no reason and the charger cover broke off (way too easily) within a couple weeks of having it. I had this phone previously and it never fell apart like this.. why does it feel like a cheap remake?!
yes,yes,yes,"Great product, but a little bit slow to ship"
yes,yes,yes,"Love it, great product and service"
no,yes,no,I am extremely unhappy with the back cover of the phone. Falling into pieces and I am unable to close it or use the phone at all! Replacement of the back cover is urgently needed.

yes,no,yes,I got my mobile before time...It was the wonderful experience with Sonia Gadget...They shipped one case for my mobile.Mobile is 10/10. I will recommend Sonia Gadget for future mobile shopping.​
yes,yes,yes,Satisfait! Bien qu'on soit forcé d'être en 3g.
no,no,no,Phone was made for Verizon. Essentially locked as you needed a Verizon sim card to unlock it before you could use other carrier. No way to use in Canada.
no,no,no,it was registered under t-mobile but it was unlocked. Still have the t-mobile apps on the phone that you cannot delete
yes,yes,yes,"I know I will love the phone, however I had to send it back for a replacement phone as it had a manufacturer's defect that could not be rectified by Samsung (could not transmit with phone). This cost me $20 shipping back to Aimee Cellphones and of course I am not happy about that."
yes,yes,yes,"Everything came as expected and on time, nicely packaged, works great, no worries! Granted I accidentally drop kicked it into wall 2nd week and cracked the screen but that was my own doing.... bought a case since, had no problems."
yes,yes,yes,"Overall I am happy with this phone. The only hesitation I have is that when it is on speakerphone, the person I am talking to experiences distracting extra noises."
yes,yes,yes,Simply the best purchase.
yes,yes,yes,"J'adore le produit! Il est arrivé en excellent état! Seuls petits bémols, il est arrivé avec un retard de quelques semaines et j'ai eu des frais supplémentaires aux douanes. Le produit en tant que tel vaut 5 étoiles."

yes,yes,yes,Very satisfied did not expect the taxes though
yes,yes,yes,"Arrived brand new, sooner than advertised, packaged well. Works like a charm. Would be better if shipped requiring signature (so it won't be left in a community mailbox or get mis-delivered just in case). But still worth 5 stars."
yes,yes,yes,One of the best phone I've ever had.
yes,yes,yes,Great product at a good price.
yes,yes,yes,Je suis content de mon achat
yes,yes,yes,Great phone came in better shape then expected. However was missing a charging cable in the box. Not a big deal for the price paid. (The phone will not work with Wind so had to switch to Fido)
no,no,no,"I got a phone which the speaker- works bad.... and some applications especially those that need locations like maps, does not work at all very bad product"
yes,yes,yes,This is a pleasure to use I have no complaints!
yes,yes,yes,"What a good phone, really nice and really leight."
yes,yes,yes,"Wow! As a senior, first time user of a cell phone I am on a steep learning curve. It took me 3 days to figure out how to make a phone call but everyday you learn something new. With all the features the question becomes will I live long enough to learn them all."
yes,yes,yes,"Envoi rapide. Ça répond à mes attentes, et même plus. Pierre"
no,yes,yes,"The phone did not meet my expectation in the beginning.It is now functioning fairly. As times goes on, I will see."
yes,yes,yes,Bought this as a gift for my son to replace his aging iPhone 3. He loves it and find it very easy to use and much faster than his old phone. Maybe I'll get one for myself too.
yes,yes,yes,Its my phone I'm typing this on it
yes,yes,yes,The phone came in quickly and works really well. No complaints
no,no,yes,Keeps shutting down when i use a facebook app. also the battery gets drained right away. and it heats up alot. But other then that. It is great
yes,yes,yes,"Arrived just in the expected date, and it's perfect!"
no,yes,yes,Telephone acheter canada version usa il y a pas le français pas de nfc la description est pas bonne vrai arnaque
yes,no,yes,The only thing that I didn't realize is the phone is a Verizon phone and when I purchased a Sim card from another provider a notification comes up that the Sim card is not a Verizon which is.a bit annoying but other then that it is great
yes,yes,yes,Battery's life span is not as long as I thought. Generally its fine
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. I had to return it cause as it turned out it doesn't work with Wind Mobile. I bought one from Wind and I love, love, love my phone, The camera is really good, the pics are awesome (and camera was the primary reason I bought this over the google phone) It's large enough to satisfy most..."
yes,yes,yes,"I am extremely satisfied from my Samsung Galaxy S5 16GB SM-G900H-BK Unlocked so far, because i can use it anywhere i travel, either it is Europe or anywhere else using any SIM Card needed. At the same time i think that it is the best smartphone that you can get and it is a joy using it."
yes,yes,yes,This is not a phone. It's an everything device that happens to have a wireless phone capability. One of Samsung's best products. Wish I could order more.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is awesome beat phone ever and responda quick and it doesn't lagg.
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone...shipping on time
yes,no,yes,"New in the box unlocked T mobile SM-G900T version. No OTA updates, have to use Kies to update which is a bit of a pain."
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone everything works, but I have to pay to get it unlocked....."
no,no,no,Received the Verizon S5. Any way to get it to work with koodo? The phone is unlocked but doesn't appear to support the right frequency or something along that line. Can't get 3g/4g to work. Update: manually setup APN settings and now have days!
yes,yes,yes,"great, it works well :)"
yes,yes,yes,No. I am not happy with this product. It was misrepresented & is NOT what it was advertised as. I had & have great difficulty using this phone as I am in Canada & it was not stated that this was a Verizon phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Super fast, super easy to use and setup phone. My first phone ever, althought not my first touch device, had no problem to figure out what is where and how to customize it how I want. Androir is super simple: don't like something? Change it!"
yes,yes,yes,It's a Samsung Galaxy S5-What else to say ! Only difference I feel is that the usual locked models with Canadian Carriers is of 2.5 GHz clock speed & this is 1.9 GHz- African edition of the phone.
yes,no,yes,"The phone is working great. However, the charger (with Europe plug) plus the converter (from Europe plug to North American plug) do not work. For the amount of money paid for the phone, i would expect a charger that works."
no,no,no,This phone does not have all the features it should have like the download booster (probably cause its the at&t version). It comes with a cheap european charger and adapter that doesn't even work cause the cheap adapter hangs out the outlet.
no,yes,yes,"Phone was used but it looked good as new! Downfall: This phone is an India version, I won't be able to use LTE in Canada or anywhere else that I am going. Bummer."
yes,yes,yes,The phone is a big improvements from other galaxy editions. The battery life is good and the phone is quiet stable compared to other Android phones e.g. Nexus 4 that I have worked with. It supports almost all communication protocols like LTE and has a good size and speed.

yes,yes,yes,"I bought the s5 active due to its durability, shockproof, ruggedness etc. One month later it slips out of my pocket and now I need a new one. Can't tell you how many times my berry fell only to work fine afterwards...It's seems I put a bit too much faith in samsung"

no,no,no,"Oh, the troubles that little problems can cause. First, there was a charger that didn't work, then a wrong cord, the Wifi that didn't work either. And the problem all came down to the fact that this product was an American S5 even though it was sent from a bedroom community of Toronto."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone was in good shape as promised and arrived in a timely manner, however the description said it was unlocked, but it did not work with my carrier."
no,no,no,J'ai commandé le téléphone deux fois et je ne l'ai jamais reçu. La première fois j'ai reçu un Galaxie Note 3 locked Verizon et la seconde un galaxie S5 locked Verizon. J'ai donc abdiqué avec ce fournisseur.

yes,yes,yes,It has t-mobile installed which I can't remove and it's a notification that never goes away and wants to be updated but can't be updated. Would have been nice if the phone was properly wiped

yes,yes,yes,"Thanks so much Nihilist, for your honest and intelligent assessment of this phone, and how it hoovers your private life and pix. I too was horrified when, by mistake, I posted photos on picadsa, and then found them all over the net, with photo recognitions of our friends, even when they were masked..."
yes,yes,yes,"I hadn't bought a new smartphone in 3 years, so I hadn't realized how far downhill they had gotten. I truly regret this purchase and feel obligated to warn others away from it. Some of my review is based on the version of Android that comes with this phone, but since it's an integral part of the..."
yes,yes,yes,It met my expectations.
yes,yes,yes,JUST AS REPRESENTED;G R 8 PHONE;THANK YOU ;R.B.

yes,yes,yes,this thing heats alot..
yes,yes,yes,Better phone than iPhone!
no,yes,yes,"NOT LTE, CAnadians: WATCH for the COD customs charge ($40+). UK plug, Took about 2 full weeks - from Brooklyn, NY? Otherwise product works."
no,yes,yes,"This particular vendor did not give me the correct product listed. I asked for a blue samsung activ and I got white, not to mention it was hardly unlocked."
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone, but there are some issues which are annoying. The back button is too easy to hit accidently, so I am constantly being kicked out of apps or websites. If that function was a little higher up on the phone this problem could be avoided."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone was ordered for my husband, and he loves it more than his last iphone, and it arrived quite quickly too! Thanks!"
yes,no,yes,"easy transaction, only drawbeck was the region unlock on the phone, but that is a samsung issue."

yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy S5 Samsung Galaxy S5 I was a member of the iPhone club for many a year now, but l2 years ago, 6 months until the end of my contract my iPhone 4s packed in; the WIFI would not connect, then the speaker went, and eventually the home and power button broke."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 I have been using the Samsung Galaxy range of phones for quite a few years now. I started with the Galaxy Ace, then I got the S3 and now I am using the S5. Before I got the S5, I temporarily got a windows phone and although the phone was good, I was unhappy with the difference..."
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S5 sure beats other competitors in the market, I was delighted to purchase a smartphone of such quality and uniqueness. The first day I purchased this device I spent at least an hour to sort out all the settings but i'm a tech guy who has a deep understanding about technology in general..."
yes,yes,yes,After using this phone for nine months I can say that this is one of the best I have ever had. The screen is vivid and the response is excellent although slightly smaller than that of the Note which I have previously owned I love the fingerprint recognition to unlock the device - it was very hard to...
yes,yes,yes,My fiancee recently got this phone as part of an upgrade from the S4 mini and I must say I am really impressed with the way Samsung have come back from the disappointment of their overs.
yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy s5 handset is the phone i am currently using at the moment. I am a samsung fanatic and i have never owned an Iphone. I have owned the galaxy ace, the galaxy s3, galaxy s4 and the galaxy s5. A few Advantages of the galaxy s5... 1- Amazing camera Quality."
yes,yes,yes,"= = = = = = = = = About the Phone = = = = = = = = = I got this phone around 3-4 months ago now, as it was time for an upgrade and I had been pleased with my Samsung Galaxy S3 and this was the phone that I really wanted."
yes,no,yes,"LOOK AND FEEL The majority of reviewers lament the lack of build quality of the Galaxy S5 due to it not being a metal unibody like the iPhone/HTC One M8 and indeed, the phone feels less solid and weighty in the hand. But to be honest, it's not as woeful as people make out."
yes,yes,yes,"I would like to make a point that this review has been based on my own personal experience with this phone, and i will be completely honest, and try deliver the best review possible."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung keeps improving their phones with every new model! I used to have the Galaxy S3 and I loved it so much I was unwilling to get a new phone. I was half scared that the new phone wouldn't live up to the one I had for nearly 2 years.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been an Android user for around a year and a half now and I was impressed with the Galaxy S4 Active, but now I'm completely astounded by the release of the Galaxy S5 4G. I knew the moment it came out I had to get it, and so I did."
yes,no,yes,"By now, you have probably heard of the Samsung Galaxy brand. Like it or not, Android smartphones have taken over Apple to be the most popular ""platform"" of operating system, this also due to the fact that there are now many cheap Androids on the market to undercut Apple's offering."
yes,yes,yes,"I can honestly say, I never thought I'd be so happy with a phone upgrade. I upgraded from the Galaxy S4 and I have to say the added features on the S5 are incredible. The picture, sound and call quality are astounding compared to the older models."
yes,yes,yes,"You can't go wrong with a Galaxy phone.The Galaxy S5 is the latest and greatest smartphone in the Samsung series. Although there is a pretty steep learning curve, if you are coming from apple devices to a android device. But if you have the patience it is totally worth it."
yes,no,yes,"I have always been a Samsung fan, and have owned the Galaxy S2, S3 and S4. I've had the Galaxy S5 for about 4 months now. So, I'll start with the positives. The display is great, it's very colourful and you can change the display type to 'tone it down' a little if it's a bit too over-saturated for..."
no,yes,no,We had a Samsung 4 Active for 2 years and had no problem when we took it in the pool. I have had the Active 5 for 4+ months when it accidently fell in the pool (not more than 3 feet of water). When I pulled it out of the pool it was dead.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I've used so far... Does everything better than my last phone which was pretty good for nearly 3 years (Nexus 4). This phone fits my specific needs very well. I drive a truck and do delivery work.
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone. The camera is amazing. We have been on multiple trips, and my wife is a photographer. She has gotten frustrated because sometimes my shots are as good as her DLSR. Can't wait for the S6 active later this week with the bigger battery."
yes,no,yes,My wife has the 4 Active and it worked so I got the 5 Active when I could get my free upgrade. The way we use them there is not a big difference between them. I don't use the new features as I don't have time alone to play and learn.
no,no,yes,glass broke after the slippery design slid out of my lap and broke the supposedly more durable glass. I think I was sold a line of bull. it only fell two feet and landed on a corner. when I called AT&T to complain. they told me it would be a $200 deductible to fix.
no,yes,yes,"If you're the person that drops their phone whether its in water, or drop it on the floor. I highly recommend any active samsung phone. Ive dropped my phone plenty of times and i have NO cracked screen."
yes,yes,yes,I've dropped this phone many times and it still hasnt crack yet.
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
no,yes,yes,"Man, i dropped this phone so many times. My bezel is busted and cracked but the phone continues to withstand horrendously catastrophic crash landings. To the extent of thinking it must be a part of the avengers or something."
yes,yes,yes,"although I am still learning the features, I can easily see that this Samsung product will be very useful in my current career. I needed a reliable phone that I can use at work, and this one fits the bill.."
no,yes,no,"I have broken many phones in the past. My galaxy has been dropped, gotten wet, & been chewed on. It still keeps going. It has lasted longer than any of my other phones."
yes,no,yes,"I am so thankful that a partner in our firm recommended the Active instead of the just the regular Samsung phone. Little larger than I am used to with the iPhone 5, some features are in different areas and the location of the buttons will take some work to remember, but overall, I am pleased."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this after my daughter dropped and destroyed her iPhone. She fell in love with the design and the operating system. I love that it has survived the drops and multiple things spilled on it. Her dad loves the safety features.
yes,yes,yes,"Great features, great voice recognition, outstanding service, phone had gotten damaged, Samsung reconditioned the phone to as new for a nominal fee. Couldn't be happier."
yes,yes,yes,This is one great phone at a great cost and Samsung phones are the best
yes,yes,yes,"Not only is this a great phone as far as function is concerned but it it's great in design and durability.I've had this phone for several years and I've dropped it almost daily (on pavement, concrete, in snow) and it still works as well as the day I got it."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phones screen and the camera is great for outdoor pictures!
yes,yes,yes,I have really enjoy my s5 active. I also like all the features that Samsung has on it to help if I have trouble or questions. I like that I can chat live or email to get the help I need. Thanks for making it a great phone to have .
yes,yes,yes,The s5 active does everything a smart phone should. Could use more ram and less boaterware.
yes,yes,yes,I had this phone for 2 years and it was very durable while I had it!
yes,yes,yes,"It's camera works perfect for pictures with family, friends, and special occasions. Also, it's helped me a lot in school for homework and assignments due to its high speed data. What I really like is that it's batery can last for the longest time and that's awesome."
yes,yes,yes,I currently own this phone and i love it. Very comfortable with it and easy to use
no,no,no,"Dependable, good variety of features, customizable. Poor placement of volume, wake, and camera buttons"
yes,no,yes,My Son and I had IPhone 3 when it was the latest and greatest. I liked the screen size on this Samsung Galaxy and decided to try it. Nothing has made me want to go back.
yes,yes,yes,Overall the new product except I don't understand why we have to have KNOX settings using our data
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from a Samsung Rugby Smart to the Galaxy s5 Active because I wanted the same waterproof, drop proof features as the Rugby but I got so much more. It's not a s6 or s7 but it is the phone they were based on. It's fast, has a great camera, shock resistant and waterproof."
yes,yes,yes,This product has very good battery life. It last for a long time. Its memory storage is very good too. It also doesn't break easily.
yes,yes,yes,"My employer bought this phone through our ATT plan...Very happy with the performance, speed and functions, I would recommend this to a friend"
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. I have had it for a year and a half now.
yes,yes,yes,I am very hard on phones and this one performs perfectly. It's way better than the 6 active. The expanded memory and removable battery make this phone a great phone. My girlfriend has a 6 active and my 5 supersedes her. Thanks Samsung.....
yes,yes,yes,The Waterproof and shockproof feature is a killer feature for me. I am no longer worried where I am taking the phone or if kids will drop it anywhere.The sturdy body makes it usable without any cover! Big Plus !!
yes,yes,yes,I purchased this phone a year ago and have absolutely loved it. The biggest selling point of the phone to me was the durability. With small children in the house there is a constant worry that a phone will be dropped or get wet.
yes,yes,yes,"It has a simple yet elegant display, I love the accuracy of the voice-to-text feature that comes installed. The emojis on this device are adorable as well. Overall, an awesome phone to have!"
yes,yes,yes,I have had the Samsung Galaxy from the 3 to the 4 Active and now the 5 active. I love the speed and battery life and app options that are both android and Samsung available. I have yet made any decision to change to set other brand or Manufacturer of a device.
yes,yes,yes,Really great phone. Traveled all over the continent of Europe. Phone has been dropped on the ground and even into a swimming pool and it still works perfectly. After nearly three years battery life is starting to show signs of not holding a charge.
yes,yes,yes,"Great graphics good unit excellent , great reception ,excellent product, great support and excellent options."
yes,yes,yes,"the best phone I have ever had, but someone stole it off the table at a local restaurant and I had device manager on it I could not track or find the phone"
no,no,no,"I like the size and weight of this phone,I even like the color options to pick from, I have the red one. But after a year I have had a few problems with it. It randomly won't allow me to make a call or send a text message even when I have service. I find I have to reboot it on a regular basis."
yes,yes,yes,I love the big screen. I could never go back to smaller one as you know the sight goes with age. But in all I'm most pleased with this product and will most definitely purchase another one.
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone! Especially like the fact that it is waterproof, because I work outside in the elements and have dropped this bad boy in puddles before...still works great!!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone has everything I need. The design is sleek and is great if water comes in contact with it.
yes,yes,yes,Great product. Love the color. Easy to use and very durable. Withstands drops and can get wet!
yes,yes,yes,"Nice bright screen, thin & feels durable. Above average battery life. Snappy software. Lots of accessories available from both Samsung and aftermarket places. It just works well, what's not to like about it?? Purchased it outright for a great price. Hoping I'll get the Android 6 Marshmallow update!"
yes,yes,yes,"Love Samsung phones. I have owned s3, s4, note 2, note3, tab 3, and tab 4. Out of all these devices I have had this is the least impressed I have been. Phone is advertised as tuff and rugged. But in reality not so much and the trade off is a phone with almost a note size, but a small screen."
yes,yes,yes,"Ever since I switched to Samsung several years ago. I have went from S3 to the S5 Active. Everyone of them better than the one before. Easy to use ,speed andperformance gets an A+ I can't come up with anything less to say about Samsung devices."
yes,yes,yes,I've always had a Samsung but this one is number one in my book.. I would rather have this phone then the iPhone their second rate to Samsung...
yes,no,yes,"This phone is great for people who like listening to music in the shower. The headphone jack is waterproof (as far as I can tell) and if you put on a rubber case and glass screen protector, this phone is basically indestructible. The screen quality is amazing and there's plenty of storage space!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is very easy to use and helpful when I am bored at times. I would play games in my spare time and this phone is very great. It is definitely a true touch screen phone.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. Though there are times where it seems to big to fit in my normal pockets. Other than that. The phone runs well. Takes really good pictures too. I use it to record lectures and occasionally send emails to my professors.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the Samsung, weather its a phone or tablet. Which we have a few of each."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a replacement phone because I had so much trouble with my original one, ATT recommended I get a new one. I can only hope it works better. There are so many aps added to this phone that are unnecessary (and you can't remove them either)."
yes,yes,yes,I drive a truck and do home and office deliveries. This phone is perfect for me. I am out in all weather and climbing in and out of my truck all day every day. The battery life is incredible. The weather resistant phone let's me work with confidence in all situations.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm pretty happy with my phone, it's durability is a key feature for me since I'm hard on phones. It also is advanced enough to run all of the apps. music , and games that I enjoy."
no,yes,no,I hadn't had my phone for more than 3 months when it started acting up it does all type of things with me even touching dropping apps moving things around etc I call my provider and they told me I could not return it to call insurance they could not help either so basically I have a phone I am still...
yes,yes,yes,"I was a IPHONE user,until I purchased my Galaxy. Don't miss my IPhone at all. Very user friendly."
yes,yes,yes,Very pleased with the s5 active bit wish it would get bigger.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is allrounder in all aspects, tough built. Will buy again."
yes,yes,yes,My Galaxy S5 Active has been such a pleasure to use. The android apps are easy to use and the phone system explains how to change or adjust your settings as needed. My sister-in-law got her phone (in black) after looking over the product with me.
yes,yes,yes,So far so good.... Still trying to figure everything out
yes,yes,yes,"Working in an industrial environment you must have a durable, strong, and easy to handle phone and this one has proven to be one of the best for me. I don't know what I would do without it!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing. It does everything that a smartphone does but more.
yes,yes,yes,"I really love the built in active case. Eliminates those cases that seem to collect dust, never quite fit right, and you wonder why you bought in the first place. People often ask where I go my case and are surprised when I tell them it came with the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent value...durable and user friendly. As a mother of 3 active children, its nice to have the reassurance that my phone is waterproof and can withstand minor bumps..."
yes,yes,yes,Signal runs allow but that's the only negative. Highly durable
yes,yes,yes,Loved the phone just had a few glitches in the software but overall a great phone.
yes,yes,yes,"This is the most friendly user phone I have owned. I received this smart phone as a gift. All the apps you use most are pre-loaded. My phone is red not to bright or to dull it is just the right shade. I had a Samsung II, when I received my new phone I gave my grandson my old phone and he loves it."
yes,no,yes,I really love this phone...however bc I'm not am AT&T customer (I'm straight talk) it doesn't let me use all the pre set apps. ..like hot spots...& for some reason I can't get our send picture messages...tho I'm told I need to call straight talk about this&they can fix it..
yes,yes,yes,I really liked it compared to other phones I've had. Just used a lot of my data.
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my galaxy phone . My first one and I love it! I've had every other type of phone and this one has got to be my favorite!
no,no,yes,I use this phone for mostly work related tasks. I have 3 jobs and can manage most of my work on this device. Takes great photos!!
no,no,no,Screen cracked when fell off a night stand. No warranty on that. Not rugged at all. Commercials show it being dropped for a waist high drop with no damage - night stand is lower. My first review was not approved - so this is a re-write.I got a lot of spam on this device as well.
yes,no,yes,I have had quite a few possative comments on the overall look of the phone. Whit the built on protective corners it is perfect for my life on the go. They help to protect the screen from shock and damage when drop which I have done many times. The performance so far has been unmatched.
yes,yes,yes,"exellent powerful product,very reliable. Meets hieghest expectations"
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded myself from an S4 I-phone, and I love this Samsung Galaxy S5 Active! The Android programs are easy to use, and it has so many features to use, already on the phone."
yes,yes,yes,I think this is the best phone I have ever had. I love the features of the phone.
no,yes,no,"Since I got this phone, I don't even have to turn my laptop on anymore. I can do just as much, and more with my phone and it is a lot more convenient."
yes,yes,yes,The phone has a large display but not too big to easily handle. The water resistant feature is probably my favorite feature of the phone. It takes the worry of ruining your phone by getting it wet out of the picture.
yes,yes,yes,"Screen size is perfect, as are button, camera, LED, and sensor placements. I love the layout and all of the Google apps. The Samsung apps are little more than annoying icons you learn to ignore, but the S health features are useful and convenient."
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone. Durable string core. Only item not great is durability of the battery cover. Luckily a replacement can be gotten inexpensively online.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my tablet, easy to use, fast and simple. Would recommend to everyone"
yes,yes,yes,this product for me is very efficient and sophisticate I'm very happy with my selection
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone it is totally me proof since I love to give my phone a bath and drop it too.
yes,yes,yes,"Overall a really good phone. I love the features and the picture quality is amazing. Although, after a certain period of time having the phone it continues to freeze and lags a lot. Also, the regular keyboard doesn't have emoji built into it and that disappointed me."
yes,yes,yes,"It's a really good phone. I have had other phones in the past, including apple and the other phones I've had always had the problem of freezing up. This one has not done so as of yet. My next phone will definitely be another samsung."
yes,yes,yes,I just love my new phone but then I have several Samsung products and love them all they are easy to use and so many features so whats not to love Thank you Samsung
yes,no,yes,"The battery alone is enough to write this review. The Samsung galaxy s5 active is not only durable, sleek, quick, and efficient, but it last days on a full charge. I forget half of the time that it even has a battery."
yes,no,yes,"I can't put it in my pocket without opening every application I have. I dropped phone in water and the battery cover popped off, had to replace whole phone. My fingers are too big for almost everything and too rough to get the heart rate and stress test to work."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great for the everyday life like when it is dropped it won't break.
no,no,yes,"I've had this phone since 9/14. It's gone through alot and has remained durable until yesterday. This phone was dropped into the bathtub several times, on cement several times, handled by an often wet, sticky & dirty 3 year old and was perfectly fine."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone because I completely shattered the screen of my Galaxy S3 and had to keep using it for about 6 months. Knowing I would continue to be rough on my phone I got the active version of the S5.i love that it's water resistant and durable. I also love all the features this phone has.
yes,yes,yes,I the way the phone is it is just right right and it takes beautiful pictures and is very clear on the pictures.
yes,yes,yes,"I can do just about anything on my phone as I can with a computer!!! Fast speed, minor issues. All around perfect for me."
yes,yes,yes,Works well and is easy to handle design is nice I have had it a year and happt with my phone
yes,yes,yes,"Durable tested by my 2 year old and 3 year old, easy to use."
yes,yes,yes,I have dropped this phone on every surface I can think of and not even a scratch. I have dropped it in puddles of water grease and oil and it never skipped a beat. The camera has better than the one I have at home.
yes,yes,yes,Only a few flaws I don't like about it. First model I had froze often after an update. Consistently. I have been a galaxy fan since the s3. I absolutely love how rugged this phone is. I've had it for about a month now.
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love my S5! I was an iPhone user and loved it, but thought I'd give Android a try again and I'm so glad I did! The only drawback is the charger cover broke off and now it's not water resistant. :("
yes,yes,yes,I have enjoyed this phone. I recommend this phone.
yes,yes,yes,I've dropped and it's still going strong . Very nice I get complacent on phone. Easy to use. Takes great pictures and captures nice videos.
yes,yes,yes,"the phone is amazing, the first thing I realized is that i was able to use smart switch and it transferred everything, contacts, pictures and apps. Everything!, and it remembered my passwords also.I thought the body of the phone was great. It feels like s hard plastic but very solid, sturdy."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great compared to the Galaxy 3 I previously owned. The cost of plans and extra data costs are a bit too much but if you want a good product this is definately one.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone by far surpasses all expectations the camera is awesome takes beautiful pictures, easy to delegate emails and phone messages. Great looking phone for the money ."
yes,yes,yes,Had a few issues after the last update but it has been fixed. Running pretty smithy now.
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone for durability, features, ease of use. Like the overall size for a protected phone. NICE JOB Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,Very rugged water proof decent battery life has tv remote heartbeat monitor and super goid procceaor very fast excellent 16 mp camera with dual camera mode and wry nice display and records 4k video.
yes,no,yes,I was especially drawn to the increased underwater tolerance of the S5 Active as compared to the regular S5.
yes,yes,yes,"Loving my new s5 active. .durable, great camera, and samsung has there own apps that work great because they are designed for there products."
yes,yes,yes,"This product is very durable I've dropped it numerous of times accidently, and its appearance is still as the day i purchased it. Although sometimes the phone does tend to heat up and is sometimes not accesible due to crashes, the features on this phone are still amazing."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is virtually indestructible which is #1, reason for purchasing it...."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has many great features, good battery life and the screen size is perfect."
yes,no,yes,"I like all of this phones featues, aesthetics, speed, customizable layout, etc...It has all the wonderful qualities of a Samsung Galaxy phone such as a removable back and battery, and expandable storage, plus a waterproof, MILITARY certified build."

yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone since June 2014, it's had its ups and downs just like any other phone. I loved that it was ""military grade"" material, resistant to drops from low heights, waterproof, etc. The camera is decent, as well as most of it's functions."
no,yes,yes,"I love the device, but the service is horrible, Will not work inside a building unless I am near a window, tried new SIM card, tried factory resetting, and device was replaced, still have no service inside, really sad that I am stuck with the device."
yes,yes,yes,This is my second Samsung Active phone. I bought the Galaxy S4 Active when it came out. I loved the phone and bought it because it was dustproof. I am a weekend woodworker and sawdust gets everywhere. I liked the sealed connectors to keep dust from the inside of my phone.
no,no,yes,The charging door broke off after only owning it for 5 days
yes,yes,yes,"Love my phone, except for two things. The battery runs down too fast. And the spell check is god awful. Really guys, I know you can fix this. It's absolutely TERRIBLE. This is my fourth Droid, and I've never had so much trouble with spell check. PLEASE re-do it, and put out an update."
yes,yes,yes,"They removed the briefing alarm feature from the clock, which is a real must (some things are addicting, when you have it, you don't want it to be gone). Had I known that it would have influenced my decision."
yes,yes,yes,Very existence phone very good for me and everyone
yes,yes,yes,"I am the past owner of a Galaxy s4 active, and I now own the s5 active. I absolutely LOVE it! I am very pleased with the UI, and all of it's glitz and glamour! The gorilla III glass is also very impressive!"
yes,yes,yes,I like the cell phone easy to use like the big screen
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is the best. i am really happy with this phone. i used to have an iphone 4 and that thing was just too slow. but samsung my friends, is the best"
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from a Rugby from 2010. i was skeptical at first of the durability of the phone but after using it for a few weeks it is living up to its name.it is a little big for me but I thing the days of small smart phones is over.
yes,yes,yes,I was a iPhone user forever.. then I used the galaxy S5 and I was hooked .. when I saw the Active I was hooked more.. the phone is just amazing all around and unbelievable pictures.
yes,yes,yes,I am a die hard Samsung addict. I absolutely love this phone. If I could afford to I would have my entire home furnished with Samsung products.
yes,yes,yes,This is my first smart phone and I am pleased beyond my expectations. I find that the keyboard display for messaging makes this feature very easy to use. The ability to access various media outlets has proven to be very valuable. The photo capabilities is exciting and fun to use.
yes,yes,yes,I really love the samsung galaxy active. I live a very active lifestyle around my barn and horses everyday. So even though I use a clip I drop my phone on occasion. So I opted for the active to give me some extra protection and still give me all the features that I've grown accustomed to with the...
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone for several months, and over-all, I really like it.. The size is a little big for my hand, but offset by being able to read the screen better. I'm impressed with the battery life, as well as the camera, and the variety of apps available."
yes,yes,yes,"I am overly thrilled with my new S5 Active! This phone is super durable, has a great battery life, and if very sleek!"
yes,yes,yes,"it comes in black, burgandy, and redneck. where are the blues or greens?"
yes,yes,yes,I've always had an iPhone . My Samsung is a lot nicer and easier to work. I will never go back to iPhone products again. I highly recommend Samsung products to all my friends I even own a Samsung smart tv!
yes,yes,yes,It has everything I have ever wanted and more...
yes,yes,yes,Had my Samsung Galaxy S5 Active for a couple of months now and love it. The screen is a great size and very high quality picture. Battery life is phenomenal even without using the power saving features. The phone is robust and best of all it doesn't bend like some other phones that I won't name!
yes,yes,yes,I was not sure whether to get the Samsung or the iPhone. I am glad I went with this phone. I never give 5 stars on anything. I believe that there is always room for improvement. This phone is awesome though.
yes,yes,yes,After using it for a little while now i really enjoy its features.
yes,yes,yes,"Great purchase , A must have ! Highly recommended to any customer"
yes,yes,yes,Having had an iPhone prior to this phone allows me give a different perspective on Samsung. The galaxy S5 Active is the most user friendly phone in the market. It also has the least amount of restrictions on what you can do. The iPhone has so many things it is restricted on.
yes,yes,yes,"I was surprised when I ordered this phone that it was available in a more rugged build (although it still seems very breakable to me), but have since learned during the last two weeks of owning it that Samsung and most other manufacturers offer virtually nothing in accessories for the S5 Active."
yes,yes,yes,I just purchased my door and I got my don't want to Dodgen Galaxy note 3 and I've been searching around and I looked about this one hidden she'd be I would had iPhone and I think a product pretty good
no,no,no,"Positive-Negatives-The biggest complaint I have with the phone is the lock button being on the side of the phone.. For something that is supposed to be essentially an all in one media device, having the phone where your fingers hold the phone while you are tilting it is a very poor decision..."
yes,yes,yes,"I just upgraded from the S3 to the S5 active and I love it. The protective case, battery life, screen, and overall performance are great"
yes,yes,yes,The phone is very durable. We do alot of biking and its fallen outa quite a few pockets. Also its water proofing is very well done. We've dropped the phone into a pool multiple times with no damage. I recommend this to anyone that is active and busy.
yes,yes,yes,"I had the Galaxy S4, which I upgraded from the iPhone. I feel in love with the product. This time around, when upgrading, I decided to try the S5 Active. I made the right choice. Not only is it more sturdy it offers all of the options that a person could want. I LOVE this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Well I got the samsung galaxy s5 active because I have had various galaxy tablets and a s3 and I noticed that they just keep getting better everytime. The s5 active is great, it feels really solid, it has good battery, it is very responsive, it has never gotten slow on me, there are too many things..."
yes,yes,yes,"My last phone was an iPhone 4. Compared to that, this phone has an awesome screen and is bigger in size, which is nice, but otherwise is not as good. When I use Pandora in a low signal area, a song will play, stop for a while and then suddenly play a new song."
yes,yes,yes,Switched from an IPhone...loving all the apps and the camera is awesome!
yes,no,yes,"I've found that the features that come with my new Galaxy S5 Active far surpasses the features of my old iPhone. Metaphorically speaking; I find that with an iPhone I'm giving a box and I'm limited to that box, but with my Galaxy S5 I can take that box, step outside of it, and change it into..."
yes,yes,yes,"I own the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active phone in the 'Ruby Red' color. Before I had this phone I owned an older Samsung phone which admittedly had far less features. I dropped that phone one day by accident and was long overdue for an upgrade, and when I was considering upgrading to the regular Galaxy..."
no,no,no,"I have had nothing but problems with this phone. I no longer can access my text messages as the ""messaging"" app stops working. This phone is filled with glitches."
yes,yes,yes,"I had the galaxy s2 upgraded to s5 active and love it. Does so much. Love the fitness app, and the accessories."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone. I have had an iphone ever since they hit the market, but I decided to try the galaxy 5 active. I was afraid I would not like it because of the bulky design but the features and ease of use make up for anything! I'll don't think I'll ever get another iPhone."
yes,yes,yes,I am a truck driver. When I first stared driving I was with vorzion. In a lot of state my phone would not
yes,yes,yes,"I just got this phone a couple of weeks ago. I'm still learning all the bells and whistles, but so far I'm impressed with the ease of use. The phone and message pages make it super easy to locate favorites to speed things up. Am looking forward to finding more interesting things about this phone."
yes,yes,yes,Love how it small but big screen
yes,yes,yes,I've always had an i phone.. Now that I've got the
yes,yes,yes,Not only is this phone a great phone but it also has the best features! I previously had an S4 and had problems with it from day 1. I have not had 1 issue with my S5!! The construction is so if you should drop it there isn't any dings on the corners. I absolutely love my S5!
yes,yes,yes,I love my new Samsung S 5 active phone. The camera takes great shots even if the subject moves. The pictures are clear. Has great storage space. I love that you can change the key board size in messaging. So far best phone by far I have had. Samsung has out done themselves! Thanks!
yes,yes,yes,I thought my iPhone was the best until I got my galaxy s5 active. I'm very happy with my decision to go back to a samsung.
yes,yes,yes,I have a heart condition and have learned to depend on the built-in heart monitor. I also love how the exercise app gives me information on diet plans and weight control. It is also very helpful with healthy and useful food preparation tips.
yes,yes,yes,"I have enjoyed my new Galaxy S-5 Active. I have had wonderful results with all of the Samsung products I have purchased for my personal use and this phone is no exception. I still have much to learn of the operational features the S-5 possesses, but what I have learned so far has been fantastic."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this phone for a few months now and dropped it a few times, mostly on concrete, and it hasn'the acquired a single scratch yet. I am very satisfied with its speed and performance even at my house which usually doesn't get the best reception. Overall, great cell phone!"
yes,yes,yes,I am so satisfied with this phone I can let my daughter do her school. Stuff it is very. Easy. To use and love the fact its water proof
yes,yes,yes,"I switched from my iPhone 4, of which I have been a faithful user of since 3G to the Galaxy S5 Active. Although the iPhone was easier to navigate and operate, the issues with it made me change to the Galaxy."
yes,yes,yes,"I moved from the Samsung Galaxy Mega to this S5 Active and I have not looked back.The Mega just had to big of a screen and I would drop it a lot, more than any other phone I owned. Also the Mega was not fast at all."
yes,yes,yes,My wife moved from Iphone5 to Galaxy5 and she is having a great time. Her transition was seamless.
yes,yes,yes,The product manual that came with this smart phone is a joke ! I have never owned a smart phone before ! It would have been nice to have a manual that explains the product and how to use it in detail . I think Sansumg leaves the owner of this product in the dark !!!
yes,yes,yes,Ive owned this phone for about 2 months. I am a true Samsung fan....I have the tablet and have always tried to own the Samsung phone.One of my most favorite apps is the CAMERA. People are amazed at the quality of pictures and videos I am able to take with my phone.
yes,yes,yes,"This is, by far, the best phone on the market!!!! Much better than the iphone! The clarity of the screen is better than my television or any computer I have. The speed connecting to different apps is SUPERSONIC! After buying this product, I want to buy a SAMSUNG TV!"
no,yes,yes,"This is overall a great phone..... but i put it under water, after securing all the snaps, and i opened it up to find that it was SOAKED. There is a small open space near the flash in which water got in. When i press on the FLIMSY back cover it moves up and down near the flash. Please HELP!"
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone, buttons need to be placed another place. Speaker needs to be better."
yes,yes,yes,"I was concerned about the size and battery life the most when purchasing this phone. The camera image quality is what made me purchase and it does live up to expectation. It is a big phone, but I enjoy being able to accurately type using a larger area."
yes,yes,yes,Reallly enjoy my new phone it has all the features that I need. I can go online do my homework this is great this is a great phone I would recommend this to all my friends and family.
yes,yes,yes,"love the camera and speed of the phone, have dropped it several times and has not broke yet...."
no,no,no,"Horribly slow. Bad. Trust me, dont buy, ive never had a phone this bad."
yes,yes,yes,"This product has gone above and beyond what I expected. It is excellent for active people, making it very simple to access the apps."
yes,yes,yes,"I replaced my S4 with the S5 Active when I switched from T-Mobile to AT&T, it is all around a better phone except for shorter battery life. I use my phone at work and do go all day without recharging, but by bedtime/recharge time it is at 25%, whereas my S4 was at 50% or better."
yes,yes,yes,This phone blows I phone out of the water. The screen quality is amazing
yes,yes,yes,This is by far the best phone I've ever owned it's very fast at downloading. I did a lot of research before I bought this phone and the only con I read was about camera and I have not experienced any problems with it.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is by far the best phone that I have ever owned.The S5 has everything and beyond that I would expect from a phone.I love it.
yes,yes,yes,"I came from an iPhone and I'm happy I did. I've always had an iPhone, but the new versions weren't as good. The Galaxy S5 Active is great. Working at a zoo, I don't have to worry about my phone getting wet or dropping it on the ground. Looks great too!"
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone so much! The only 2 downgrades from the original S5 are that the charging port is downgraded to a 2.0 instead of 3.0 and their is no fingerprint reader on the Active version. I could not care for these two things so it makes the perfect phone.
yes,yes,yes,"This is my very first Smart Phone. Until now we hung on to our old ""dumb"" phones. When we got our new cars, our old blue tooth phones would not reliably connect to the cars. So we got our new phones. It sure has a lot of entertainment as well as useful features packed into it."
yes,yes,yes,"My husband and I upgraded recently from the Sony Xperia series (he had a TL, I had an Ion) - we had no choice since AT&T stopped carrying Sony phones. I thought we were going to have a hard time transitioning, but the S5 Active has been everything we originally wanted in our Sony phones."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung galaxy s5 active oh yes that's exactly what we're gonna talk about...let's see if its really durableThis has all the top tier specs as samsung galaxy s5 in case of software,but the s5 active lacks a fingerprint scanner...it does perform better than its competitors but not so good.."
yes,yes,yes,I have had an iPhone for a few years. I switched to the Samsung Galaxy s5 white with the fit gear had some trouble with the gear after 3 days took the phone and gear back went back to my iPhone I seen the S5 Active and wanted to try it.
no,no,yes,"New ACTIVE 5, 2nd day Cracked screen. Not dropped, not subjected to pressure. No one wanted to back it up. Not the Carrier, not Samsung. Got the cracked screen speech(user error) and if I wanted it fixed...well, expensive phone=expensive fix."
yes,yes,yes,It does everything . This active doesn't have a scanner but it does lock. I got the red one and it is so nice.
no,yes,yes,"Paid $444.99 including shipping. Came with phone & charger in bubble wrap. No box or manual. Advertised as mint condition. No finger prints or scratches. Pluged in T-Mobile SIM and it worked. Product quality gets 5 stars, presentation gets 1 star."
yes,yes,yes,Having weird issues with it
yes,yes,yes,excellent my husband love it
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Rugged look. Big fan of the Samsung Galaxy Active range.
yes,yes,yes,I've had the phone for a week now. Works Great! The phone itself is awesome and the price compared to what you would pay with a carrier or a Next service is a deal.
yes,yes,yes,I love it. It's the best. No faults. Works perfectly. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,speed is very fast uploaded and download
no,yes,no,The phone was great but now only 4months after the battery is already swollen . After spending so much money on this phone I cannot believe the battery is defective already.
yes,yes,yes,Great deal and love the phone!
yes,yes,yes,exceeded expectations
yes,yes,yes,"Phone looks good, works good and as I expect works wonderful. Good buy"
yes,yes,yes,I've now received the phone so I can't give a full review on it. It works well with my GSM carrier and it performs the basic functions (I haven't tried the water proof part yet). However the packaging could've been done better.
yes,yes,yes,Great shape as described in the ad.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Works well!
yes,yes,yes,Great Product arrived faster then expected thanks
yes,yes,yes,"Was advertised as new but it wasn't, the screen didn't have the peel off plastic cover on it that new phones come with, and there was pocket lint in the buttons and behind the battery cover (outside the water proof'd area which is good)."
yes,yes,yes,"Love it, we have an S5 and my wife decoded she needed something more durable for her butter fingers, it hasn't disappointed her yet so decided to get me one as well. Like much better than the regular S5"
yes,yes,yes,Fast ahipper. Love the phone. Amazing

yes,no,yes,Phone working great.
no,no,no,"Phone looks like new , everything works it should ... put my Cricket Wireless Sim card in and it started working didnt have to do nothing els it started working Phone still had protective plastic on front and back"
yes,yes,yes,Arrived early. Everything just as it is supposed to be. Great phone for a great price.
yes,yes,yes,The phone works great but I dI'd encounter a problem...the micro SD card reader slot is broke. I am really upset with this and didn't know if this is fixable.
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone ! Still taking a while to get used to all the features and learning how to use all of them. Bought the case and screen saver as the package. The case clip broke 2 days later. Previous phone was a Samsung Blaze so this was quite the upgrade. Overall would recommend.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product so far. I have used it for about a month and it functions as advertised.
yes,yes,yes,No regrets... purchased several months and I have no complaints.
no,yes,yes,I've had nothing but problems with the (2) Galaxy S5 active's I purchased for myself and my wife since day 1. The numeric pad sometimes disappears and shows symbols that make no sense and the phone freeze for no apparent reason all the time.
yes,yes,yes,The best phone ever. My wife needed a replacement phone. I suggested this one. She loves it. I will need another one soon since someone stole mine. You cannot trust anyone when you buy this phone.
yes,yes,yes,My son only likes galaxy's.
yes,no,yes,NOT WATER PROOF. BARELY WATER RESISTANT. Do not buy this phone for its non-existent water proof features. I double checked the seal before taking it in the water and I did not bump the phone on anything. Yet on two separate occasions water penetrated the seal and caused problems.
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone very fast, quick charging and the only negative is ATA bloat wear."
yes,yes,yes,My son love this phone
yes,no,yes,Had very few dents only one minor scratch on the screen and IT ARRIVED A WEEK B4 SCHEDULE!!!
yes,yes,yes,No complaints :)
yes,no,yes,Fantastic fo this price..
yes,yes,yes,"Love it, my first smart phone, altho I am just now going to activate it, have not had the time."
no,yes,yes,Item said new but clearly it was not new. Lint in headphone port. Mic hole had hard crusty stuff in it and all other crevices were dirty as well. Other than that it work just fine
yes,yes,yes,"At first it seemed like a good product, but a short time later, we noticed that the phone was just flashing on and off weird lights. Mrs. Peggy Barela"
yes,yes,yes,"This is one awesome phone. I received this cell phone on time and in almost new condition. The ad said it had minor scratches, but I only found one tiny nick that is barely noticeable unless you are really looking for it. I really like the Samsung Galaxy S5 Active and all of it's rugged features."
yes,no,yes,The camera lens has big chunk out of it and is scratched it's not 100% new like they said it was
yes,yes,yes,ill just keep saving i have only seen one in real life one time.Thankyou soo much this dream come true for me. this phone wonderful ive been fighting cancer it can take my heart rate has alot health orientated features built in like a pedometer and the heart monitor is real i chart calories too.
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone. It came very quickly and it was in great condition. I would recommend to all who want a phone that is durable.
no,yes,no,"I purchased what was described as a brand new phone, not entirely true it. Someone had purchased phone before and returned it due to the fact that the phone is defective. Phone constantly reboots itself. I did not attempt to return phone since I didnt have a backup phone to activate."
no,yes,yes,"I really love this phone, but since the day I got it, I cannot understand anyone when I get calls, and no one can understand me either. There is a major echo. I am in an area that has really good service, so that cannot be the issue."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great with pictures, ruggedness, despite the case it comes in I also bought the ""unicorn beetle"" protector case just for extra protection. seems to be fast and smooth for various apps (few hangups/lockups) I can only give a 2 and this is a low 2 because the battery life sucks."
yes,yes,yes,"This is an interesting cell phone. It has sacrificed some slimness and a nifty fingerprint reader for some added durability and an extra side button. Most recently, I have been using the Asus Zenfone 6. I miss the extra inch of screen as I find it easier to type and read on a larger device."
yes,yes,yes,"good phone working perfectly, i will buy again another one for my mom!!"
yes,yes,yes,"Long story short, the phone got wet and completely died. Might have been my fault, but it didn't come close to what it was rated. Other than that, it was a great phone. But since one of the main things I wanted was something that could survive a short dip in water, I was disappointed."
no,no,no,Did not work correctly. The screen went out and was not sensitive to touch. To the point it would no register at all.
yes,yes,yes,Got the phone really quick it is in great shape and works awesome! ! Thanks again
yes,yes,yes,"Very fast, lots of memory, a micro SD slot for even more memory, sturdy, well-built, good camera, bright flashlight. Best cell phone I ever owned hands down. The only little downside is that it comes preloaded with lots of unnecessary software."
yes,yes,yes,like better if I had a book to explain things. I'm 70yrs so I don't understand it all. Would like a book to help me out with it. But it don't come with a book.
yes,yes,yes,"Phones been everything I expected, and was just how they described it"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone!!! Nothing I mean nothing wrong iwth it and works great.
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone, finally got the 5.0 lollipop. It is a beast of a phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone, awesome transaction."
no,yes,no,The phone was not described correctly it had a lot of scratches in the case came broken a big chunk missing out of back of the battery case and they classify this phone is barely used. They are falsifying their ads so beware of this individual.
no,no,no,"Got the cell working for arround two months, batery life is almost the same as bad as S4, the product feature to be water resistand, but mine was dead after FIRST 5 minutes watter inmersion on my bathtub !!!"
yes,no,yes,What does the trade in value mean I have a s5 active will they let me trade it in on this
yes,yes,yes,Its on great conditions and work as espected.
yes,yes,yes,Phone is great! !
yes,yes,yes,"The overall design of this phone is quite good, this version samsung phone does not ""overheat and bursts into flame"" as the new version 7 seems to do. build wise it is a big phone made of hard plastic which has good and bad points unlike plastic/metal construction of other phones such as iphones."
no,no,yes,Battery was shot. Will not hold a charge what so ever.
yes,yes,yes,Wasn't such a fan the back piece kept falling off. The signal was not any good. Only liked the camouflaged on the back. Your better of with an iPhone.
yes,yes,yes,"I was, and am thus far very happy with my cell phone purchase."
yes,yes,yes,This device is Everything in the palm of my hand.
yes,yes,yes,More phone then I need. Size and quality outstanding.
yes,yes,yes,Soweit alles in ordnung bis auf kabel und kopfhörer sind irgendwelche noname. expressversand nach deutschland war reibungslos und schnell.
yes,yes,yes,Very good condition and working good
no,no,no,screen cracked when it fell on my carpet floor I thought these things are supposed to be indestructible if so how does it crack from falling 4 feet onto the carpet
yes,yes,yes,"awesome phone,got it for my wife,i was rewarded ;)"
yes,no,yes,I do not subscribe to ATT and it does not get good reception. it always has to transfer from one carrier to the other. don't like all the ATT apps it is loaded with that wont work anyway and there is no way to dalete them
no,yes,no,SLOW RESPONSE TIME BUT I LOIKE THE PHONE. BETTER IF HAD A FASTER PROCESSOR.
yes,yes,yes,"Received it right on time, worked exactly as it should"
no,no,yes,"I don't give bad reviews lightly however I have gone through 5, Samsung Galaxy 5 , phones and ALL of them have had a glitch with the photo gallery. I've upgraded, troubleshooted, received 2 replacement devices and bought 3 outright. I'm so sick of this problem. Please PLEASE advise a solution."
no,yes,no,When I get the phone the speaker didn't work
yes,yes,yes,I really like the Galaxy Actives. My family of 4 now have 4 of these. They work great!
no,no,no,Defective phone. Bad battery and issues with the camera/sensors. Shopping from a different seller. Returned.
no,no,no,"the screen broke after just a few months of normal use. Besides, the back cover does not close anymore. Really dissapointing device. Very poor quality"
yes,yes,no,Came as described and still working great. The cord stopped working but the box that attaches to the cord works just fine.
yes,yes,yes,Works great had trouble using battery while charging stopped that though.
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased this product for my mom how was coming off of an iPhone 4. She didn't want a phone for over $300 and she wanted a waterproof one so on paper this was the perfect fit. However despite the item being listed as new, it was clearly used."
yes,yes,yes,"What a great smart phone. Much better than iPhone 6. More pleasing to the eyes, more options, very user friendly. I am always eager to use it which I didn't feel about iPhone! Samsung Rules!"
yes,yes,yes,awesome phone. i am glad i bought it
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone, but i faced some problems with the receiption-signal!! its less that any other phone!!"
no,no,no,I use wifi calling - this product DOES have minor issues with overheating when charging and using wifi or gps for extended periods of time. Then again most phones do. Just take a damp cloth and hold it to the back to wick away the heat.
yes,yes,yes,"I had some initial issues getting it up and running but once I deleted the default APN, and made one with the T-Mobile settings. Now the only real complain I have is the speaker seems a tad weak and the buttons are a little easy to hit. Pick up an otter box and you'll sort it out."
yes,yes,yes,Works awsome its a keeper for sure its works great more clear view than the s5 I had I give it 5 stars
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent product, quick service"
yes,no,yes,"I paid 400$ and I got the bill for 250$, it came with scratches on the sides, .... not my best experience .... and it's not possible to update to android v5.0 lolipop"
no,yes,yes,"Great phone, there is a scratch that is very deep in the phone, that was not mentioned in description. Screen protectors have a big bubble over the scratch spot."
yes,yes,yes,"This is such a good phone and at a very reasonable price. Easy to use. Good battery life. I bought one for me and one for my son, and I may get one for my wife, too. The S6 doesn't have expandable memory or a replaceable battery. The S7 is too doggone expensive."
no,yes,yes,nice replacement for phone I shattered screen on.
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good, no problems with it."
yes,yes,yes,Phone was in good shape but when I tried to do software update it wouldn't take I called att they told me it had been under a different number and had a history of not accepting updates. Do not purchase from Super 18 Deals
yes,no,yes,Slim and compact but limited protection for camera lens.
yes,no,yes,I like it durable and strong
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone! I absolutely it!
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 Active is a good phone. I really liked all the features except that you couldn't change the home active screen for the apps....barometer, compass etc. I would have liked to be able to add or delete items to that screen. On that note.."
yes,yes,yes,"Great little rugged, water proof phone - well not so little, but still great. 5-star would have been earned if the backing did not pop off when it was dropped."
yes,yes,yes,Good product except that the battery keeps dying.......would be iffy if I recommended this company. Stacy
yes,yes,yes,The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is the battery cover. Cracked mine removing it the first time. Love the large screen and buttons. Battery life is triple that of my old Casio C811. Even with heavy Web usage still have close to 50% at the end of the day.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone for my 17 year old , very active, son and so far he loves it!"

no,no,no,8 months later it quit working. Samsung says it is unrepairable and has had un-authorized repair or parts. Phone was supposed to be new when purchased.
yes,no,yes,Purchased this with the thought that I was really getting an UNLOCKED phone as it stated. In reality I got a phone that was not unlocked and still has money owing on it so I can not put it on any carrier nor a prepaid carrier.
yes,yes,yes,IS What I ordered. I'm satisfied with my s5 active. Holds up so far.
no,yes,no,"Had a number of glitches that could not be completely resolved by T-Mobile or Samsung. Problem might be that the Active is designed for AT&T and not 100% compatible with T-Mobile. In any event, had to return them."
no,no,no,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! I bought this item on April 1, 2016, and today the screen FELL out of the phone and shattered on the floor!!! The glue just completely wore off and the item is useless, now. I'm very angry and dissatisfied. A phone should last for more than a few months!!!"
yes,no,yes,Works great for Straight Talk.
yes,yes,yes,"I like this phone. It is rugged, feels great in your hands, is smaller than most phones with equivalent cases to the S5 Active's built in form, and has about as good a battery as the S4. Also, seems pretty fast and handles fast internet speeds well."
yes,yes,yes,It met my expectations.
no,no,yes,Battery life short. Needs extra time charging.
yes,yes,yes,"My expectations for this phone were exceeded. I received it within three business days, as quick as I had hoped, and without a scratch on it. Thus far, it works excellently with my straightalk service. I can't complain at all."

yes,yes,yes,"Worked as expected, awesome product"
yes,yes,yes,Great purchase.

no,yes,yes,"The phone has a small crack at the top near edge, the charger port is missing the part that covers it-I can see where it was ripped off, and last, it doesn't want to charge! It keeps beeping off and on and has to be in the perfect position and cannot move at all or it'll disconnect."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is awesome. Has all features I desired and some I didn't even realize I wanted. Fast, great camera, even works as a universal TV remote!"
yes,yes,yes,"How sweet it is, I love it,thanks!"

no,yes,no,Phone freezes and overheats
no,yes,yes,Loved this phone but I dropped it from less than knee high onto a laminate floor and cracked the screen all up.

yes,yes,yes,"The best phone, love it."
yes,yes,yes,Grandson loves this phone. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned a Galaxy S5 active for 19 months. I love it. I recently had the opportunity to upgrade, but chose not too. Anyone looking for a phone should check out its features on YouTube. I was sold right away."
yes,no,yes,"I love this phone. I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy S3, but didn't want to spend the big bucks to get the newest version. Even though it said it was an unlocked phone, it came in an AT&T box, but that was ok because I am on AT&T."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent product, I recommend it for its characteristics"
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone. All it was advertised to be and it was unlocked. Upgraded from Samsung 4 to Samsung 5. Very pleased with the product.

yes,yes,yes,Took longer to arrive than is it was supposed to be by a lot. Product is fine.
yes,yes,yes,Ordered the Samaung Galaxy s5 for my middle child his delight in the product was far more than i expected and the price was really reasonable...Package arived in the expected time frame everything worked as advertised no issues at all so far....and ive have one happy little boy here....
yes,yes,yes,awesome phone. love it
no,no,no,I'm disappointed. I ordered this phone new and it came used. It also came with an LG charger instead of a Samsung charger. The battery dies fast too.
yes,yes,no,"Like the phone a lot,home button seems weak tho.I guess time will tell.I hope its not a problem."
yes,yes,yes,everything ok. good choice.
yes,yes,yes,"I got this for my son, so far, he is very happy with it."
yes,yes,yes,It was what I expected.
yes,yes,yes,First time ordering something online .. and it went completely better than I thought it would..
yes,yes,yes,Great for surfing the web and playing games. Lousy at everything else. Constantly dropping calls. Usually takes more than 1 try to get a text to go through. Absolutely hate this phone!
yes,yes,yes,"Thought I was getting an ""acceptable"" used phone, but it would appear that the phone was nearly new ,reboxed, no damage , I'm not a geek, just put the a fairly new Sim card and SD card in and charged the battery to100 % ( which was a brand new genuine samsung)"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone came in two days earlier than expected, which is pretty sweet. Also he said it was a new phone and it was. No dings or scratches. Everything still in plastic. So I would recommend anyone thinking about getting this phone, well I say do it. You won't regret it."
yes,yes,yes,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PHONE! Just needs more space.
yes,yes,yes,The phone as expected!
yes,yes,yes,Works well but screen in dirty. Looks like phone dropped in coffee. Several stained spots.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone for my Dad, replaced his Google Nexus (brother picked it and I was for a Samsung S5 back then)... which is a phone my Dad never totally liked... but all the kids chipped in to get it for him, so he suffered through having this for a couple years."
no,no,no,"Phone was delivered today, but phone is still locked to another customer. I did all I can do about fixing the problem, I will appreciate if you all would something about it. Thank you Desmond Veals"
yes,yes,yes,I love it. Works perfect
no,yes,yes,"The phone came in nonfunctional status. Once we were able to remove the voice mode, the touchscreen would type random letters by itself. If I pressed a letter, it would also type in multiple letters that I did not type."
yes,no,no,"Phone died after 2 days. I can however, understand how it passed inspection. It worked beautifully for those two days. I got a refund very quickly and hassle free as well."
no,no,no,It stopped working only 11 mouths of use . Screen is going out.. but I loved it till then.
no,yes,yes,"I purchased a Samsung Galaxy S5 from this company (a phone that is water proof, can be submerged in water up to 1 meter for up to 30 mins) when the phone did not perform the way it was indicated, and I contacted WirelessDiscount USA to find out about simply getting a replacement phone( not a..."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! It works beautifully and is awesome.
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. It's a quality phone and at a good price. I like the weight of it and the size is perfect. (Not too big). My apps all run perfect and the battery lasts all day for me.
yes,yes,yes,Excelent product
yes,yes,yes,wish i hadnt bought it.
no,yes,no,Not what I expected very poor
yes,no,yes,awesome design. looks like a device for military use. got few issues (like didn't offer additional battery) but very satisfying. outstanding.
no,yes,no,"Not cleand too many problem to conect , lost time"
yes,yes,yes,great phone thanks
yes,yes,yes,When I received mine the body was in good shape but there was a scratch on the LCD under the glass
yes,yes,yes,"Love my phone! Buy a case or screen protector. Like just do it. I cracked my screen and now have to get it fixed... :( , but its a great phone exactly what I was expecting."
no,yes,no,The back came in cracked but it seems to help absorb the force when I drop it 2 plus times a day. The phone is durable alright.
no,yes,yes,"Really nice phone.... has been working well since I got it, the only issue I'm having is that it tells battery life is poor."
no,no,no,Bought 2 of these phones a couple weeks apart. The first one arrived ok but the SD card slot was broken. Didn't matter because I dropped it fromay waist height onto carpet and the whole screen shattered Second one I ordered arrived with a Crack in the screen.
yes,yes,yes,Good phone for a good price.
no,no,no,"Phone arrived with a broken back battery cover so it doesnt work as water resistant, and a battery that can't hold a charge for more than 20 mins. Other than that, it's a good phone."
no,no,yes,"battery dont last no longer than a day, even when its not being used!!"
yes,yes,yes,"Good Phone, little hiccups now and then. Will only buy apple in future."
no,no,no,"We are having issues with this phone, like the ir blaster isn't working and the heart monitor isn't working and the home button tends to double click and open up the google app several times before going back to the home screen, even after I have turned the app off."
yes,yes,yes,Phone was in the condition that was described. Works great. Would buy again
yes,yes,yes,I was pleased with this purchase. Good product and accurate description.
no,no,no,Bad glitches. It restarts around 15 times a day. I can't even watch a YouTube video without it becoming to strenuous for it and restarting itself. Also had one of the buttons cosmetically busted on the front.
yes,yes,yes,Really nice phone! I am getting the s6active when my money co.e up!
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is packed with features including NFC, heart rate monitor, etc. Only drawback is the battery life even when features aren't used and turned off. None the less, would still recommend this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Love my phone , great for accident prone people. I drop constantly every where and it is still working perfectly. My husband wants one cause he bought a lg stylus the same time as me and he is already having problems. So I highly suggest for someone who is accident prone."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great, but the battery dies REALLY fast."
no,no,no,Screen was broken upon delivery
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone for my son and he is happy with it!! So far he hasnt had any issues with it!!
yes,no,yes,it was just like they said
yes,yes,yes,"fantastic deal , great phone"
no,yes,yes,broke the next day
no,yes,yes,Was broke when I got it
yes,yes,yes,"Love my new phone. Havent had any problems with it. Love the camera(I take A LOT of pictures). Its not as ""durable"" as it claimed. But hasnt broke yet either. And I drop it often."
yes,yes,yes,I really liked this phone. The only thing I have noticed as I looked online is that a lot of people are cracking their screens very easily. This happened to this phone. I have already replaced the screen and LCD twice on it. I can buy a cheaper phone and they seem to hold up better.
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with this phone I am going to buy 1 more for my spouse
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with my purchase of this Samsung S5 Active. My S4 Active served me for over 3 years and survived being dropped off a roof onto a concrete drive, and dropped out of a deerstand twice (17 ft). I finally managed to break the screen."
no,no,no,"This is without doubt the worst phone I've owned. Flakey from day one.Now 3 months old and it constantly drops bluetooth connections.Fails on all my bluetooth devises that other phones work fine on.Settings change mysteriously,totally unreliable."
yes,yes,yes,I've had it for about a month now and so far it's been working great. It also looked new when I received it.
yes,yes,yes,"This is a fantastic phone! My husband is a truck driver, and needs a heavier-duty phone as he is accident prone. I decided on this phone, and don't regret it for one moment. He's already dropped it a few times, and you couldn't even tell."
no,yes,no,"Cell phone was advertised as like new, but the speaker doesn't work at all so I can't make calls."
yes,no,yes,Not a dud and runs like a champ!
no,yes,no,I knew I had wasted my money when it failed during setup. My phone was junk.
yes,yes,yes,this phone was the beast thing for the pirce
no,no,no,"Suppose to be new the camera has always had a fog and it is between the lens and case, I have never dropped this put it in water or anything else came like that. If I was told it was used and the camera had issues I would have bought something else. Very disappointed with this item for what I paid."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone but back cover if very brittle. I thought this was an ""active"" model?"
yes,yes,yes,Love it. Just what I've been wanting. Good size. Heavy rugged phone. Great camera. Can't go wrong with a galaxy!
no,yes,no,i bought this brand new sim free and my sim was incompatible with the device. I tried updating to see if this would fix the problem and it said that it is unable to update because the device has been modified. Someone has tampered with the phone I received
yes,yes,yes,"phone was great but charger was faulty. When I used my wife's charger, phoned charged fully and I have had no further problems"
yes,yes,yes,"it is sealed well, and i a quite pleased with my new phone. however, the battery is just so so."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone but all the settings were not in English. Had to log on to the internet with my pc to find how to change the settings. Other than that everything was as described.
yes,yes,yes,Just upgraded from the s3 that I used to death. The s5 is so fast and the camera is miles better. This is the eu version of the phone. I've had no problem using my UK sim. I definitely recommend some gorilla glass for a screen this size!
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned this phone for almost two months now after finally replacing my quickly deteriorating Ace 2, which, I admit, was a brilliant and commendable phone until I obliviously installed the dreaded Jellybean update, which, combined with the phone's limited memory and RAM meant it began to lag..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, but for some reason all the paperwork and initial language on the phone was in Polish (I think..).. Not a problem as such, as when you start the phone you can change the language, but a bit odd! Also comes with a EU plug instead of a UK one, but seller included a converter plug."
yes,yes,yes,AMAZING. Everyone should get this phone! Such amazing value compared to the €549 the were looking for in shops! Hahaha WIN! :D absolute win!
yes,yes,yes,Great phone great delivery ticks all the boxes
no,no,yes,It is not so good as Nexus 5 in terms of Chinese input. But its battery life is longer which was the primary reason for me to buy this phone.
no,no,yes,Very disappointed as was a Chinese version and unauthorised firmware that cannot upgrade to android v5
yes,yes,yes,great all round service and price...
yes,yes,yes,Sometimes acts a bit special functionality wise - freezing mainly but that's common in well used Samsungs and has only happened a few times since purchasing. Overall good condition just as described. Decent value for money.
yes,yes,yes,"This is my second purchase and apart from the flimsy usb cover, it is a brilliant phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Original S5 set up in Polish, some apps in Polish and can not change the language of them, but for the rest, excellent."
yes,yes,yes,Got it as promised and brand new
no,yes,no,As described...no 4G in the UK as it's a European model. Rear cover doesn't seem to fit 100% properly so unsure how water proof it will be.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is new but the seal has been redone. Beware. I kept it since I had to go overseas. I got it from ELITEGSM.
yes,yes,yes,It's got a really good UI but the downfall is that the battery can heat up a bit however everything else is good and it came earlier than it said it would
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant apart from fact could only be used on EE which was ok as I needed it for BT mobile but may have proved difficult.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and delivered nice and quickly.
yes,yes,yes,"Juts receive my device and after testing it and setting up the phone I am extremely happy the device..great specs... some things like the silver plastic chrome let the design down but taking that away the phone is top notch...quick,up to date,4G,etc what more can you ask for??"
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant phone. Nice size and works very well.
no,yes,no,"Phone works, charger is already dead."
no,yes,yes,Everything works apart from it says its unlocked yet EE Sim doesn't work.
yes,yes,yes,Phone us great few problems with charging but new charger etc bring sent out to fix the issue! Good communication with seller
yes,yes,yes,Very good service and product.
yes,no,yes,"Moving from S3 to the S5 was a huge leap. The device has more too offer, better battery and very light and thin. Comparing this too the Iphone 5s/6 i was intending to buy this has more too offer with a removable battery and micro sd card in which you cannot get with an Iphone or any other Apple..."
yes,yes,yes,All seems ok for the time being
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely brilliant for price, highly recommened."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent value for money
no,no,no,"Unfortunately the phone did not work. The display was corrupt and completely unresponsive. The included quick start guide was in French, ideal if you are French, the problem being that I am not, so was unable to start quickly, which I couldn't do anyway as the phone didn't work."
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone, excellent service from the sellers :)"
yes,yes,yes,Great came much earlier than is was due to.
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone and easy to use
yes,yes,yes,Excellent value for money
no,yes,yes,"The ringing tones are not loud, very disappointing"
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is pretty much as you might expect. For me, it's not as good as the iPhone I used to have, that is just due to some things about the OS where the iPhone is superior (eg. cannot swipe left to delete text messages)."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this Samsung Galaxy S5 Plus (SM-G901F) instead of the Galaxy S6, which I had been waiting for. After weighing up the options of a OnePlus, S6, Note 4 and several other devices, I settled on this. I have a Galaxy Note 8 tablet, so have no need for a huge phablet."
yes,yes,yes,By far the best Android mobile in my experience! Very good battery and clear screen with a well displayed keyboard.
no,no,no,My phone was not unlocked. And this has caused a ridiculous amount of hassle to find someone who is able to unlock this EE mobile for me.
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 is a beast! It plays any game i throw at it very well, great at multi-taksing and should be enough for another 2-3 years in terms of technology."
yes,yes,yes,Item exactly as described....First class service.
yes,no,yes,"A good phone but has so many glitches that let it down it just frustrates me I'd recommend the HTC One M8 which I would have had instead, now have to indure these glitches and faults and lack of silent mode for two years."
yes,yes,yes,This was a marvellous buy I am extremely pleased with this phone very good value.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone ever had
no,yes,no,fingerprints not working.. thx
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic hubby loves it
yes,yes,yes,Works like expected
yes,yes,yes,The wife likes it better than her iPhone 5s. Enough said.
yes,yes,yes,does what it says on the tin
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone just as good as s4
yes,yes,yes,"Received few days ago!! Nice phone, everything is working!! Thank you!"
yes,yes,yes,Great product and service.
yes,yes,yes,brilliant just what I expected
yes,yes,yes,"I've had the phone over a month now and i have had no problems yet, works perfectly, battery is amazing and has 4g."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, no complaints at all from me."
yes,yes,yes,"bought a samsung s5, works perfectly and is exactly as described, mint! thanks"
yes,yes,yes,Had the phone now for about 2 weeks very happy I went from the Samsung s3 to this battery a lot better easily get a full day out of it with normal use camera is amazing and very quick ' the simple fings what do disappoint me on the phone the front camera I can't work it out but it makes you look...
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, great price, great company. Would recommend to anyone. Worked on 4G, came unlocked and haven't had any problems yet."
no,no,yes,Not as good as the HTC One M8 for sound audio but a few software updates could resolve the problem of sound that is either too low or too high and conversations that are not always clear. When playing music sometimes the first 2 seconds of a song are missed.
yes,yes,yes,"It works properly, good smartphone!"
yes,yes,yes,So nice to use after iphone 4 10/10
yes,no,yes,Fantastic wireless charger i had trouble with others that were heating my phone way too much but this one is a lot better i would advise anyone to buy this one ahead of others it really is first class
yes,yes,yes,Perfect very happy with it
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, love it :)"
no,yes,no,WARNING This phone arrived REGION LOCKED - This is what a sticker says on the box “This product should be activated with a SIM card issued from a mobile operator within Europe.
yes,yes,yes,Very good came quite quickly no problem love the product and would order from again no problem.
yes,yes,yes,Works fine. Some scuffs on case.
yes,yes,yes,Seems to have trouble with being registered on the O2 network. Works on Vodaphone. Much better than S3 so a big improvement from what I had. Just be careful about getting a contract online as you will want to test the network before making the commitment.
yes,yes,yes,"Love the galaxy s5, such a beautiful phone. Some customers have complained about it not being the euro version but mine is definitely the euro one. No complaints so far"
no,yes,no,Nie phone except --- it is seemingly to fix separate ringtones/message tones for specific callers... spent hours trying. (Failed) This is a real pain as I like to know if its my son calling for instance and had I realised this I would have bought a different phone.
yes,yes,yes,"great phone, great price"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent value. Excellent phone
yes,yes,yes,Galaxy S5 Enough said. Brilliant bit of kit.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone takes a little getting used to after Iphone, in my opinion a better phone"
yes,yes,yes,Great item. Great delivery. Good price for new.
yes,yes,yes,i have save a lots of money with this purchase. it works perfectly. i highly recommend this product.
yes,no,yes,Great Phone only alternative for iPhone for me. I like how you can insert up to a 128gb micro sd card to boost memory and also how you are not tied to apps from the app store like with apple. I have many apps installed from outside of the google play store.
yes,yes,no,Was every thing I knew it should be it worked as soon as I put my sim in unlike the last one I sent back which was't unlocked
no,yes,yes,Battery kept on dying and phone switching off randomly.

yes,yes,yes,100% Best Choice!
no,no,yes,Great but had to take to samsung to fix as wifi would only work if connected to wifi and wouldn't work with 3G or 4G samsung fixed
yes,yes,yes,"A great phone and miles better than the iphone for the price, absolutely no niggles with it and do not hesitate to recommend it. The great feature is that you can expand the memory easily and cheaply."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone at a very good price. It arrived ahead of schedule & up to now is working beautifully. I'm very impressed with it's features though it's going to take a while to discover all it's capable of.
yes,no,yes,"A bit bigger than is comfortable to use or carry, but you get what you pay for."
yes,yes,yes,"I've not had much luck with this phone. It has fried 4 batteries. It has become unusable. Apart from the fact that it is junk quality, it just isn't a great phone to begin with. It is very square and last generation looking."
yes,yes,yes,"Really pleased with my purchase! The phone has been working great, no quarm's at all! So yeah I'm pretty happy with it! :-) delivered quick and packaged well...thank you so much !!!"
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant a lot better than the older model

yes,no,yes,"Does the job, as advertised."
yes,yes,yes,love my new phone
no,yes,no,Genuine product from Europe. But careful if you are intending to use it outside EU. It's region locked. You have to activate it with an EU sim first before using it in a non EU country.
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone. Does what is supposed to. Reasonably good camera.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is such an improvement on the S3 that a had before. A lot of new features.
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic phone.,..nothing short of shear Brilliance..only know that this comes with a Euro 2 pin plug, which...well, is quite frankly not very British is it....but is very EURO (wink)"
yes,yes,yes,"Really good phone, never let me down !"
yes,yes,yes,Great machine in the right hands
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone and excellent German supplier, however it has had a couple of issues to date. The SD card reader has failed twice, first time the phone was replaced and the latest time was corrected with a factory reset. The finger scanner also failed the first time it was replaced."
yes,yes,yes,An excellent phone. I won't ever return to Apple.
yes,yes,yes,"Worked great, just ordered a case for it."
no,yes,yes,Wasn't aware that US Cellular carrier is CDMA which will not work with GMS carrier as AT&T and T-Mobile. It was in excellent cell phone but had to send back which vendor refund my purchase price.
yes,yes,yes,It was a gift for my Son. He loves the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"No problems yet, havent' begun to fully take advantage of everything this device has to offer."
yes,yes,yes,It's awesome.. Thank you!
yes,yes,yes,The phone is beat up on the out side of it but all in all its better than what i had. The shipping took way to long better to got with ups than USPS.
yes,no,yes,"I've had this phone 2 1/2 years and love it. It has the features I want such as a good sized screen, removable battery, expandable memory and water resistance (I 'm outside alot) I would like larger internal memory but not a big deal."
yes,yes,yes,"Works good, arrived as described."
yes,yes,yes,Item as described and working fine.
yes,yes,yes,as advertised. using to charge spareally battery until I can swap it out for my phone.
yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy s5 is like the perfect phone. It's not to big and has a great screen with excellent color. Samsung really got it right with this. The only thing when you run out of phone memory it will act funny, but that's my fault for all the photos lol Pop in another s.d card and your good to go!"
yes,yes,yes,Highly satisfied. Nice phone. Now my son is already begging for more memory. Good thing I can add to the s5! :)
yes,yes,yes,Phone works great and had no problem getting it hooked up to my monthly plan.
no,yes,yes,The phone was everything advertised. Once I received the phone I called us cellular to activate it and it was working in 10min! This is a great way to get a new phone to replace a current one on a contract.
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone alot
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone and the shipping. I would have gave you five stars if I had known that no sim card and no charger were included. It just happen that I had both, but alot of people may not have. Just think you should let people know. But thanks for a good phone."
yes,yes,yes,Love it! Came super fast everything was perfect had it up and running within 20 minutes. Would definitely recommend.
yes,yes,yes,I bought a s5 from here and when it arrived it looked just like new! Was pleased! Was able to take it straight to US cellular and start it up! Only needed a SIM card which they took from my previous phone. It came with a box charger the cord to it and a pair of Samsung ear buds. Worth the money!
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone
yes,yes,yes,Good phone Got here quick
yes,yes,yes,Excellent job! Thanks so much!
yes,yes,yes,Was better than described.
yes,yes,yes,The phone was still active so i couldnt activate. Other than that everything is ok
no,no,yes,This is the most ridiculous price I e seen on an S5. The new version is out and this price is way inflated. This phone is now maybe $250. People need to research before buying and don't purchase this one.
yes,yes,yes,"easy to navigate, great features, awesome camera. GALAXY S5 rules!!!"
yes,yes,yes,It worked great its just not what we needed ... Loved it though...
yes,yes,yes,Much better than the s3
yes,yes,yes,It is great so far.
yes,yes,yes,Arrived early and it has solved my problems
yes,yes,yes,Best dual sim phone you can buy
yes,yes,yes,"At the time I bought it, I couldn't find a better phone. Great phone."
no,no,yes,"I got this to replace my S4 Mini Duos which had broken Screen/LCD. Personally, I find this S5 just that bit too big and obtrusive. It has Android Lollipop 5 on it, and this upgrade has messed with the programming of button functions (i.e."
yes,yes,yes,"The functionality of the phone is great, including the dual SIM. Note that only one of the SIMs can run on 4G, the other one will remain on GSM. Switching which one is on 4G in the settings menu is quite easy. The phone's big problem is its very delicate display."
yes,yes,yes,I really am enjoying the use of my new phone as I'm normally an iPhone kind of guy this duo is really benifiting.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Does what it should, and much faster than my previous HTC. A word of warning with the dual SIM, which is not quite precise enough in the product wording. If you want your second SIM to be from the 3 network in the UK, then you have a problem."
yes,no,yes,I was unpleasantly surprised to find in a phone box charging cable old model...
yes,yes,yes,"I received precisely, what I expected. And it come on time. It was just as it sholud have been. Thanks"
no,yes,yes,brilliant phone as expected from samsung ... too bad they don't get software update more often and don't get sold in store all over the word ...
no,yes,no,"Please don't buy any Samsung Smartphone Series. I faced lots of problem while using Samsung Galaxy Grand 19082GT. Automatically restart, Hanged, All applications won't work properly. I filed complaints in perherdar, all Indian consumer courts, I mailed to all shopping carts sites."
yes,yes,yes,"Avoid this phone and it's new replacement, the S6 has the same weaknesses. Shame on Samsung for opting for glitz rather than quality of materials and engineering."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy is a good unit, because of its size. I find it ends up, in my back jeans pocket most of the time and its main frame is made of plastic, I have some fear I will forget when setting down and break something. The speed is outstanding, then color on the screen is great."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone, Galaxy S5, does more stuff than I can possibly think up- and it is intuitive!"
yes,yes,yes,"Fast, reliable, good battery life, I've had all of them Samsung Galaxy from the S1 and this one is by far the best of them all."
yes,yes,yes,"A very reputable dealer. Joseph at Mobile Deals remained in constant communication with me and replaced a defective phone immediately. The phone is a beauty and I can't wait to explore all it can do. . To me, water resistance is one of the best features."
yes,yes,yes,Great item. It met my expectations.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Came early as expected!
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, exceeded expectations."
no,no,no,Every turn on it lets you know your sim isn't Verizon
yes,yes,yes,"Good value on a great phone. Bought this for my wife who is on Cricket wireless. Popped out the sim card from her old cricket phone, put it in this one and she was good to go. I am only giving it 4 stars because I did have to do a factory reset about 3 weeks in due to the phone looking for signal."
yes,yes,yes,Came fast and phone was in great shape.
yes,no,yes,Worked great for straight talk after I fixed the internal setting for 4G on straight talk website
yes,no,yes,Mi first Samsung galaxy is incridible is real 4G lte
yes,yes,yes,"Gorgeous phone! I was living with an old iphone 4 for years and decided it was time to upgrade, however AT&T makes it difficult to complete a simple upgrade without renewing contracts and what not.... This phone was perfect! I just plugged in my SIM card and the phone started right up!"
yes,yes,yes,Good phone. Happy that it does work with straight talk.
yes,yes,yes,I activated my phone threw straight talk and I've had no issues with my phone love it
yes,yes,yes,"I am giving 4 stars to this Phone for the only reason that I do have issues with finger print scanner. Otherwise this phone is great, has great features , High quality display bright and vibrant colors. The battery is also much better than more other similar ones."
yes,yes,yes,"I like this phone a lot, I haven't seen any galaxy the color of this one. The same versatility of any Samsung Android. I give it five stars!"
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good. However, there is no owner's manual."
yes,yes,yes,"What can I say....it's a Samsung Galaxy, always fabulous!"
yes,yes,yes,"I really love my new phone. It has so many features that helps me organize lists, calculator, calender, camera, and many more. To many good things to list here. I have a grocery list, prayer list, and to do list. Great phone"
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, fabulous display. Here are some notes: 1. Buy a microSD card and change phone settings to store on it rather than the physical device. 2. The phone charges quickly, lasts all day with hard use and two-three days with minimal use and wise choices of wi-fi, bluetooth, GPS. 3."
yes,yes,yes,really nice phone
no,no,no,Micro SD card slot and finger print scanner don't work. Two main features of the S5 so I would consider this to be a defective product.
yes,yes,yes,The best phone ever. I don't know why they went backwards with the Galaxy S6. This one is definitely a better phone in size and performance.
yes,yes,yes,I'm definitely satisfied with my phone.
yes,yes,yes,I am very Pleased with my phone!!!
yes,yes,yes,"The finger scanner never worked right for me. But not sure if the malfunction its from the manufacture... I am okay without finger scanner not working. Everything else, as promised."
yes,yes,yes,Phone is in perfect working condition and met expectations.
no,no,no,"After 11 months of use, it had to go...did good for the 11 months, but connector was having difficulties and phone started running slow. I did a factory reset, wiped off all apps and it still doesn't work right."
no,no,no,This thing never worked. I bought it to gift my uncle and he told me that the mic and ringer are not working and so he switched back to his old phone. I lost the money and most importantly I felt embarrassed.
yes,yes,yes,Everything I expected from it. Upgraded from an IPhone 4s so I'm super happy with it. It s***s on the Iphone 6 too.
yes,yes,yes,My daughter is very happy with her new Iphone cell phone
no,no,no,"I'm from Argentina, and it work OK."
yes,yes,yes,I replaced a S3 with this phone. The only things I don't like is that the S5 is a longer phone and the audio does not seem quite as loud as the S3 and really weak compared to my Note 3. Other than that it is a great improvement in all aspects from the S3.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Brand new in the box, this is everything it claims to be. Perfect!"
yes,yes,yes,battery cover does not close completely
yes,yes,yes,"I don't think that the phone came unlocked as advertised. When I booted it up, it came up as at&t. But the phone came in great condition, and I love how it responds. I would definitely recommend it to a friend."
yes,yes,yes,This phone gives the casual phone user plenty of power and memory right from the factory. Camera is pretty good too.
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 does very much everything I want a phone to do, does a few things I never knew I wanted or needed and it does it all flawlessly and optimally. The temptation to list specs and discuss every single feature is strong but... well..."
yes,yes,yes,. Item as described
no,no,no,Touch screen is not very responsive. Have to tap several times before I can open a file.
yes,no,yes,The galaxy s5 redefined smartphones being the first flagship to be waterproof. The galaxies continue to amaze us as they come out. Lets compare it to the iPhone 6.. The s5 is waterproof-The 6 isn't The s5 has a 16 mp 4k res shooter- the 6 has a standard 1080p 8mp The s5 has 2gb of ram - the 6 has...
yes,yes,yes,STILL loving this phone..I was suspicious since it took longer than usual to deliver( it happens) but this company took the fear away and gave me an extra 30 days warranty. VERY THOUGHTFUL. It's been going strong ever since. I appreciate the professionalism and live my phone
yes,yes,yes,"This was an ATT edition and while the phone was unlocked to work internationally, it has some glitches and had a limited language selection. Do not recommend if you are planning on taking it overseas, but a great phone to use in the U.S."
no,no,no,Because the charger es bad
no,yes,no,The S5 wants you to be safe. It has this horrible feature called car mode. When in this mode it will reject calls and texts so you will not be distracted while driving. Car Mode activates any time this phone is paired with any Bluetooth divice.
no,no,no,"The description says new but the phone came used, when I opened the back to put in my SIM card there was dirt and went inside and smudges all over the speaker and camera lens. There was no protective film on the camera lens and the box was papers and slide on cover."
no,yes,no,This phone worked for about an hour before malfunctioning. Freezing and power button refused to function
yes,yes,yes,It's a great smartphone !
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect, and at a great price!"
yes,yes,yes,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs."
no,no,no,Don't waste your money here. The phones sold by Phones4lezz cost less for a reason. They do not work properly. We found this out the hard way.
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. I feel a lil old because now they have a S7 out.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone.. Works in Barbados with Digicel and LIME providers. Still learning all the features but the transition away from Blackberry is totally worth it
yes,yes,yes,this device is Colen (fake ) device it's not the original one. don't buy it
yes,yes,yes,EXCELLENT PHONE ....USE ANY WHERE IN THE WORLD WITH GSM TECH
yes,yes,yes,"Damn i love this phone sooo much, that gold is just so darn sexy maan,"
no,yes,yes,"the phone came nicely packaged; the only issue i had was that it came with a travel adapter as opposed to the original charger which i was expecting; perhaps was just an oversight on my part in reading all the specs, but other wise the phone is working fine"
yes,yes,yes,"When i received my, it has been unboxed without original samsung seal. Anyway, phone is good condition. Good phone overall."
no,yes,yes,"COMPRE ESTE CELULAR PARA USARLO EN USA Y EL CARGADOR QUE TRAE ES UNO EUROPEO.... ESO CREO QUE NO DEBERIA SER ASI.... COMO PODRIAMOS SOLUCIONAR ESTE INCOVENIENTE, PUES DEBERIA DECIRLO . Buy this cell for use in USA and charger brings is European... I think that should not be so..."
no,yes,yes,"The phone is great, the only bad thing is that it came all in Chinese! I had to take the phone to a technician to help me to change it to English."
yes,yes,yes,"We purchased this phone thinking it would with our US cell phone provider. Nowhere in the description does it say anything about being an ""International"" version cell phone. Our cell phone provider told us this phone is not as fast as the U.S. version cell phones."
yes,yes,yes,it works way faster then my s3 worth the upgrade
yes,yes,yes,I bay a phone 4g but is not 4g.thancks for cell phon.the cover beack is 4g this is very good.
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased this phone in order to support our need for maximum flexibilty both at home and during frequent and extended international travel. During the 5 months I have been using it, it has met or surpassed my expectations in every way."
yes,yes,yes,i love this phone
yes,yes,yes,"Good night. ask apology for the delay in answering this mail , but right now is that I'm getting my hands on the product since I live in Venezuela and I can only say that I feel very happy and satisfied with my product . thank you very much..!"
no,no,no,LTE feature does not work T-mobile US. Ended up getting it from T-mobile.
no,yes,no,"I have a problem right now and i would like to get an answer, the phone came in a different box with no manuals, but fine the phone was perfect. The problem is that it doesn't connect to my phone network i have internet and signal but im not able to make any phone call or send any text, i would like..."
no,yes,yes,i heard that the F versions do not work with Lte in the USA. Not sure why sellers are not specifying for this is very important information. the only reason most of us want to buy such expensive phone is to be able to enjoy all the features that comes with it..
no,yes,yes,It's not G900F! This model is SM-G900H WITHOUT LTE 4G!
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded to the S5 from the Note, and I'm VERY happy with it. Battery duration is way better than the Note's, it's fast, excellent screen size and doesn't feel so bulgy in the pocket."
no,no,no,"This has been the worst purchase of my life! First of all, this is a knock off phone and not the actual one, and when they still refused to return it and I tried to use it it would not even work! and their reply is simply, ""refer to the manufacturer of this product as it is under warranty."
yes,no,yes,"Okay, if you're here you probably have made your research about the S5 so you know it's an awesome phone. I do, however, wanna talk about some aspects of this version since it's and unlocked version. First of all, yes, do you get the SM-G900F version."
yes,yes,yes,"Both a warning and some good news. The sellers do not seem very well informed, so here is the result of my research. WARNING - This is not warrantied in the U.S. You have to call the Samsung EU for assistance. Samsung UK 0330-726-7864 GOOD NEWS - Unlike the U.S."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone it self is fantastic, but in the posting add for it I didn't see anything that this one was set up for a foreign country. The charger has the two round prongs, and the device was in Spanish when I first received it."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, as expected."
yes,yes,yes,very good phone. better than iPhone 6
yes,yes,yes,Thank you... My boyfriend was really surprised..He loved the phone so much..its awesome..thumbs up
yes,yes,yes,Excellent. This phone is everything as avertised. It was originally set up as a Rogers phone. I'm using this phone on Koodo network with no issues. The LTE data works well. The second unlock code worked to unlock this phone.
no,yes,no,This phone arrived weeks late after several phone calls. It never worked properly though the replacement I have just purchased is spot on.
no,yes,yes,Does what it is supposed to do BUT WHY DOES GOOGLE NOT RECOGNISE THAT THE ISLE OF MAN IS A COUNTRY AND HAS ITS OWN TELEPHONE NUMBERS - 01624 and 07624. It takes a lot of adjustment to.be able to access the internet!!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect. Just what i hoped for, and not the g900h version so many others have gotten from different suppliers!"
yes,yes,yes,Wow amazing service that was quick and reliable with a genuine product I wanted ... works like a dream. Thanks
yes,yes,yes,"As advertised, great price, fast deliver, would recommend."
yes,yes,yes,Good camera and great interface
no,yes,yes,What a disappointment this phone is been unblocked and not unlocked! When I first switched it on the welcome page was from the spanish provider MOVISTAR and the phone has settings modified with movistar apps. I feel was cheated!!! Do not buy from this dealer (DEALS CENTRE)
yes,yes,yes,Improvements on everything against my old Samsung Galaxy S3 - especially the weight Ordered on a Saturday and got it following Wednesday. Really pleased.....
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent device BUT advertised as a G900F, unfortunately turned out to be a G900H which means no 4G support! Still good value for the money, but like most people, I dislike being mis-sold something, consequently the 3-star rating."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this piece of electronics as a New Year gift for my spouse. She is very satisfied. From my personal experience, the hardware is very good, every application is working pretty fast and very responsive (at least by now). The camera is good, the display is great. I satisfied with the purchase."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone now at price it should have been I can live with it being plastic It will hopefully survive as many drops as my trusty s3 Ad sd card slot for my music and audio books plus removable battery to extend life of phone past its original battery life sadly probably my last samsung phone if...

yes,yes,yes,item as described. excelent
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had this phone a few days, but I already live it, with some caviats! I really don't understand why some of the better parts of the S4 seem to have been abandoned. It's like this was designed and built in a different place by different people."
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. I am happy with the phone
no,yes,no,broke in under 4 months but used the warranty to get it fixed but it's playing up again so doesn't last very long
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone. As described.
no,yes,yes,Upgraded to this from note 3 it more like a downgrade its awful laggy and slow in comparison on the plus side it looks nice and feels good in the hand also the software got some handy features Like quick connect so I can stream stuff to my Xbox one but seriously its more of a half a step up from the...
yes,yes,yes,delivered less than 24 hours. As new product
yes,yes,yes,"I GIVE IT 5 STARTS TO THIS DEALER,VERY PROMPT,VERY HANDLING,AS DESCRIBED ON THE TOP OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT!THANK YOU."

yes,yes,yes,Very satisfied. sometimes it does not work though
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone cannot fault it
no,yes,no,My phone was working fine in UK. However I took it to North Cyprus and when I insert the SIM card it keeps asking for System Unlocking Code and I have not been able to use it. Next week I am going to South Africa where I spend most of my time and if it does not work there then I have no use for this...
no,no,no,the sistem is slow
yes,yes,yes,Cant go wrong with this phone
yes,yes,yes,Amazing Phone - Now even better with the KitKat Update Been using this phone for a year now - Major upgrade from my S3 mini - Larger screen size is extremely useful. A few software glitches with old android build but KitKat is a vast improvement with huge speed improvements.
yes,yes,yes,Tried various phones (all Android) and this one works best for me. Given seller's note about strange languages on this model I was a little worried about provenance of the phone.
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant. On time as described. Only downside as its a reseller only had 18 months warranty. But saved over £130
yes,yes,yes,"Brilliant phone & unbelieveable price. Ordered saturday, delivered monday. Only.problem was invoice had no IMEI number on it, which is needed for insurance purpose but quickly supplied by DealCentre when requested via email. Very happy, so far, after one week"
yes,yes,yes,Received phone the next day after order. Good product as described!
no,no,yes,"I have very poor eyesight and I was a little concerned that I wouldn't be able to use a ""smartphone,"" but the brightness of the screen and colors make it possible for me to see what is necessary. I'm 75 yrs.old and use a PC, iPad, and 3 Kindles."
no,yes,yes,"I won't say much about the phone except that I hate the material its made of ...""plastic"" Plus the way it feels in my hand it seems like I better not drop this phone The camera is great battery life is okay the real problem is the software as touch wiz is one of the worst laggiest Roms with tons of..."
no,yes,yes,It's not compatabile with some network carriers. I have used to be a customer of T-mobile and Simple mobile so far. I am experiencing poor network and internate connectivity related with this cellphone.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is great but it sometimes freezes.
yes,no,yes,I need my money back
no,yes,no,"The S5 appears to be something i would have liked but the phone I got was a genuine P.O.S. I bought it to upgrade from the S3 that i have had for a couple of years but it turns out that it was more annoying than my ""slow"" s3. Totally disappointed. I am back to using my old phone."
yes,yes,yes,I don't have a good one so I have nothing to say...
no,no,no,The screen started coming off within the first week of recieving the phone in the mail. It also doesn't have a lifetime warranty. I missed the return window and now I'm stuck with a phone that has a screen that is messed up and makes my phone glitch when using it...
no,yes,no,i am from Guyana...i would like to know if this product will work in my country with Digicel?
no,no,no,"Worked great for 8 months, then the screen started to flicker when the screen was dimmed. Then the screen would flicker a yellow color when dimmed. Then sometimes the screen wouldn't reactivate when unlocked; touch worked, just no image. Had to pull the battery out every time this happened."
yes,yes,yes,I got the wrong item although I added a clear remark to get the right version. Beyond that a got it with many scratches and the charger was not the one they should provide
yes,yes,yes,"Works perfectly and no problems hooking up to Tmobile plan, exactly as listed."
yes,yes,yes,Product came exactly as described. Would definitely buy another cell phone from them.
yes,yes,yes,Excelent product!
no,no,no,This phone is terrible. I get really bad phone and data service compared to my old phone and now the screen keeps freezing! The only way to get it back up and running is to take the battery out which I have to do about 3-4 times a day.
yes,no,yes,"It's fantastic !! So far I'm pleased with the functions of the phone. It arrived exactly when it said it would. In addition, I came updated and the battery and apps are as they should be. My one an only disappointment is the contact app provided in the phone."

yes,yes,yes,Powerful machine.. Love this cellphone
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone with the intention of it being a multi use device. Aside from the obvious - it being a smart phone - I wanted to have a place to store my music, and my ebooks. With a 128g additional storage capacity, I think I've got what I was after with this phone."
yes,yes,yes,It's very awesome and hasn't had any problem with it. It met my expectation
yes,yes,yes,"Good product Samsung Galaxy S5 G900F Cellphone Unlocked, International Version, Retail Packaging, White, but now in 2016 would recommend not buy for more than 200 $. This was an opinion based product in a neutral position and also purchased from my pocket."
yes,yes,yes,"the battery is not working now, it wasn't long time to now (just 9 month) so now, I have to invest to but a new buttery, not good"
yes,yes,yes,This cellphone came with several problems. At first the initial configuration was very difficult to make as it came like for blind disabled people and that wasn't the mayor problem in fact it didn't recognise the letters I was pressing. Another problem is the speed.
no,no,no,"very bad the model, black screen, i only use 1 year, wast money, advise don't buy it , friend, seller nothing to do."
yes,yes,yes,"It works with my network, excellent product."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung galaxy s5 is a great phone, but this one is not the one to get is you want an actual Samsung galaxy s5. this phone never connects with 4g only 3g hspa, if I am lucky. If you are planning to use it in the States at all, don't do it."
no,no,no,"Dont buy this phone. It works fine at first, but all of a sudden it fails for no reason. It started to freeze every 5 minutes, making it impossible to use. Touchwiz goes into error every few minutes too."

no,yes,no,it says unlock but if i insert different sim card its still lock

yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, great construction, switching from an S3 and loving it. The biggest issue on the S3: battery life, seems to have been solved, this one will last for about 8 hours of heavy use. The screen and touch sensiblity are awesome. I'm really satisfied with this purchase."
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic phone. It works fine with Movistar, Movilnet and Digitel in Venezuela."

yes,yes,yes,"Package in perfect state, brand new phone, unused. 3g working successfully in Argentina. Charger seems to be from UAE and USB cable is 2.0 (and not 3.0 as it should be). It does comes with Samsung Original Warranty, but it is only valid for Middle East countries and Africa."
yes,yes,yes,Excelent product
no,no,no,"It took me a while to figure this out. Those who plan to purchase an unlocked phone and intend to use it inside US please be careful. Most S5 models came with LTE capability, but not all of them are compatible with the US provider. For example: G900A is specific for AT&T, 900T is for T-Mobile etc."

yes,yes,yes,product according to the best
yes,yes,yes,"A great flagship...light, thin, awesome screen, long battery life and stylish (if you haven't held one, you won't understand). Throw in water and dust proofing, removable battery and micro SD memory card dock, and you've got an unmatched phone."

yes,yes,yes,"I'm in LOVE with this phone! It's amazing ♥ ♥ ♥ I'm so happy I got it, the screen is beautiful, the pictures are beautiful, the UI is superb, it's just an overall amazing phone (Upgraded from the S4). My one problem is that the description advertises 4G LTE capabilities and that's just not true."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product. I had the S3 before so I was not surprised.
yes,yes,yes,"great experience, everything was smooth and perfect"
no,yes,yes,Dont has software in spanish
yes,yes,yes,The phone itself is amazing but my only complaint is that the company advertised that is 4G lite when in actuality it's H+. If you're planning to buy this phone and use it in the usa take into consideration that this phone won't have 4G lite
yes,yes,yes,works like a boss no problems what so ever
yes,yes,yes,"Works like a charm. My wife is totally happy with this phone. We had a Samsung S3, but this S5 is far more advanced."
yes,yes,yes,Everything was perfect. Amazing phone. Original Samsung S5!
no,no,yes,"Feels really cheap, like it is made of garbage plastic"
no,yes,yes,I didn't get the right cable for the special usb. The charger was U.k standard.

yes,no,yes,This cellphone is more expensive than S4 and the different is just a bit. I miss my S4 for the size and the look
yes,no,yes,"The phone is Ok even though the iPhone %s feels much more like a premium product, mainly due to its aluminum body. Changing from IOS - which is far more polished and intuitive - to Android is a real challenge."
no,no,yes,"Hate it! Hate it! Hate it!!!!! What a stupid design! My galaxy S5 has enough useless features to fill days of exploration yet the home button wakes the phone and there's no way to disable this feature. Every time the phone is in my pocket, the home button inadvertently depresses and wake the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Yes, mine seems to have come from Saudi Arabia. Hey, it's the international version. Works perfectly here in Trinidad and Tobago with Digicel. I got a different sim card, as my carrier didn't have the proper blank for cutting.."

no,no,yes,"Ordered G900F (European version) but come with G900I (Asian version) instead. Some app not compatible with ATT (my carrier), eg. ISIS wallet."
yes,no,yes,I have used it for a month. it turned out to be a real revolution! This is the first time I use Samsung smartphone and I feel it is a wise choice.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm not happy with the product, I live in Venezuela and when you try to change the language to Spanish not make it. visit a representative from Samsung and you can not change the language"
yes,yes,yes,Very nice smartphone
yes,yes,yes,Everything ok. Delivery works perfectly. The only problem was that the usb cable delivered 2.0 instead 3.0
no,yes,no,phone screen keeps turning off
yes,yes,yes,"It's prefect! However, I need to go to the shop to change the micro SIM card. My workmate tells me that just cut the card, but I didn't do that.

yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone!
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone! In fact best phone i ever had for now. With the Otterbox defender case that I bought, it will stay just like new for years. Great battery, light, alot of features.

yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone after I did numerous research about which unit to buy (SM-G900F or SM-G900H) but I choose the 900F because of its LTE capabilities which apparently not if you use it in the states...

no,no,no,Phone come New. charger is overseas 220 v (UK).so I send it back.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is great in all aspects but be wary of your carrier. I get 4g ccross Europe but not in the USA on AT&T. The phone suports the AT&T 4g bands but I gave up trying after an hour on the phone with tec support. Still better than carring two phones thou.
no,yes,no,I like the phone. But have to send it back. Signal very weak in sim slot 2.might as well just have a regular s5. Have tried switching dim around same result
yes,no,yes,"The phone is great, but it is not global LTE enabled, actually doesn't work on LTE in Argentina..."
yes,no,yes,"Good night my friend that phone is totally new, if get the Spanish language if you have the software in Spanish"
yes,yes,yes,The dual sim set up is perfect for those who work in countries where 2 sims are required because telephone reception is poor on the networks. The S5 is a great handset with a large screen and reasonable battery life.
yes,yes,yes,Salve... Sarei interessato al prodotto!!! Qualcuno sa dirmi se c'è la lingua Italiana?
no,no,no,"The product met my expectations partially, since the LTE band doesn't work in my area (Uruguay). Despite the local company provides the LTE service, they say that even the phone is international version the LTE band from this phone is not useful in some providers of different countries."
no,yes,yes,"I have been using this for about a month. I have not had an oppotunity to use the dual sim cards, but otherwise it is working wonderfully. The instruction manual that was delivered with the product was in a language other than English."
yes,yes,yes,Works great for Canadian snowbirds who have to keep access to their canadian phone as well when in USA....only drawback I can't get LtE connection only 3G or H+
yes,yes,yes,Did not realize the SIM card size changed from the S4! Pain in the neck. Works well with two cards for travel. Not difficult to manage and you always now which SIM card you are using.
yes,yes,yes,This is a great Phone. I am now able to use two sim cards. I can receive calls from both my lines.This means the two lines are active at the same time. I place calls from the either of two lines and the same applies to texting. Reception is very good. The camera takes nice photos.
yes,yes,yes,"Best smartphone I have ever had, dual sim on an original S5 is what makes it a unique device."
yes,yes,yes,"I was using a galaxy s4 unlocked and it worked very good on 4g lte network t mobile, now I bought this phone and it doesn't run on 4g lte, only HDSPA, someone know why? 36303"
no,no,no,Samsung America wont repair the international version of S5. Be aware before you buy it
yes,yes,yes,"We bought two of s5 unlocked , 16 GB. It is an excellent phone and user friendly . Great value for money!!"
yes,yes,yes,I love it - I use it in USA and UK and have not problems. It is a very smart phone!. I use it with AT&T and Vodaphone Sims.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung S5 is a great phone with a lot of functionality. Great camera. It's bigger than I'm used to so it's not a great phone to carry in your pants pocket. Took some getting used to switching from IOS.
yes,no,yes,"i dont know about you, but me knowing and using Samsung product for a while now allow me to understand the product more than the other apple and htc and the other people a little more. i'm raiting this phone not for it specificity but for samsung product in general."
yes,yes,yes,Would recommend to anyone. No problems found
no,yes,no,whats wrong with the battery????????? every time battery hot??????can u give me any solution.....
yes,yes,yes,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm 6'2"", so coming from a 3.5"" iPhone 4S, I appreciate the 5.1"" screen. A tab bit bigger, like 5.5"", would be perfect for me but I know many don't like phablets so it's a personal preference thing. Camera is great with a 16 MP rear snapper. Front is 2 MP so selfies don't come out amazing."
yes,yes,no,"Good evening , I'm from Venezuela and to this day I received a phone samsung s5 read buy , but to turn it on I realized I had information from a person named monica ruiz with data from the US for what I wanted to give me an explanation because when I did not buy it because I wanted a new phone and..."
no,no,no,didn't realize international version meant it wouldn't have a warranty but i had no serious issues with the product
no,yes,no,buy this phone four months ago and has damaged the battery is discharged quickly. delete applications to see if it was and still persists. thanks what can help me
no,no,no,"I received item 2 weeks late and the box seal is broken, so disappointed. I don't know what happened??????"
no,yes,no,"I had an S4 and I accedentally bundled it up in my sheets--my sheets were black and so was my phone--and washed it. My S4 was totally broken, and it cost me $450 with a new 2 year contact."
no,no,no,Carefull... The phone lcd touchscreen doesn't work...!
no,yes,no,"This phone is a UK phone. Seems to be working fine, however, you have to register your phone in the UK. The phone support number is an international number. Also, some words are spelled wrong. For example, when I am making a call, it says ""DIALLING"" (not the two L's)."
yes,no,yes,"I’ve been an iPhone user for as long as I can remember. Ever since its first release, I’ve been a solid iPhone fanboy. But it all changed with the release of the Samsung Galaxy S5. Every single feature in this phone is perfection to my eyes."
no,yes,yes,The phone seems to be ok.. Unfortunately i can not enjoy it fully as the battery has been giving out on me in 3hrs or less
yes,yes,yes,"didn't have the standard Samsung screen protector on it , just a clear one. They also didn't include the USB 3.0 cable! They also didn't include the USB 3.0 cable! They also didn't include the USB 3.0 cable! They also didn't include the USB 3.0 cable! They also didn't include the USB 3.0 cable!"
yes,yes,yes,"This Samsung Galaxy S5 is the best phone to get right now, it has alot of cool feature you`ll love and the battery last long. I use it at work and by afternoon depending on long I use it for, I still have 70% left."
yes,yes,yes,"Since 2010 i was using an iPhone 4, BUT NO MORE! The iphone 4 was a great smartphone, but since iOS 6 it changed a lot. More slower UI and, well, i was so tired of the slow processor and i bought this beautiful device."
no,yes,no,"I am using it in Turkey. I did not need to use the phone for 5 mins with USA operator. So it was fully international unlocked version. However I am not satisfied about S5, since it is so warm, may be hot, while using GPRS data."
no,yes,no,First of all the phone says it must be activated in Saudi Arabia or one of these middle eastern countries. The phone is region locked. I have tried three different unlocking agencies and no help. The folks sell g this phone knew there was no way for me to get this phone to work properly.
no,no,no,phone not unlocked
no,no,no,"Bought 2 s5 phones which are working well, however one of the battery is already overheating which makes the phone very hot."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent. I got my package on time
no,yes,yes,"Warning, this phone, despite being a Samsung Galaxy S5, DOES NOT come with 4G capability. I did not think it was possible for a phone, as new and advanced as the S5, to NOT have 4G capability. The first month I owned the phone, I thought I wasn't getting 4G due to poor network connections."
yes,yes,yes,Love It! It makes my girlfriend happy.
no,yes,no,I got my phone on time and it was working fine until yesterday the camera stop working and now it only says... Camera Fails... i do not know to fix it... i need help please

no,yes,yes,"I ordered this product on June 8th, 2016. It worked amazing so I even ordered a second one for my dad. I am so disappointed with the phone my dad received. It worked great up until today. There is a problem where he can not text one contact in his phone."
no,yes,yes,Too many problems
yes,yes,yes,Exactly what I waited for! Perfect
yes,yes,yes,Everything perfect!
no,yes,no,"The phone looks brand new however, the ""impression touch"" screen does not work."
no,yes,yes,After a year the phone decided to lock itself to an unknown network. I could not get it unlocked and ended up having to buy a new phone.
yes,yes,yes,its very nice; i like this jeans
no,no,no,"I'm not sure if it's because I bought it used, but the mouth piece wasn't working, after less than a week. was very disappointed :("
yes,no,yes,"Disclaimer: I bought my Galaxy s5 directly from T-Mobile (USA), so my review is regarding the phone itself, not the one sold by this particular seller. I love it. In my house I have a problem getting network signal from different providers."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! Had no problems. I used it in Argentina with Movistar. 2 years user.
no,no,no,It was a gift I haven't heard anything bad so I guess its good
no,yes,no,"Failed out of warranty of 2 years by 4 months, could not be repaired."
no,yes,yes,"I don't know what's happened..but the battery never lasted more 2 hours.. I bought a new battery from samsung but the same. The screen had problems as well. In short, I had to buy another phone. I wish it was just a case."

yes,yes,yes,I love it and it takes my abuse.
no,no,no,I must tell you that about 13 mos after buying this phone the display chip starting acting up and iI would have to remove the battery several times to try to get it to work.
no,no,no,I am very disapointed since this phone did not work properly using T-Moble connection. Neither T-Mobile nor Samsung Tech support said it will work here in USA as the phone was manufactured outside this country.
yes,yes,yes,"I was very disappointed in receiving this phone. First issue I had was that it wont do 4G LTE despite the answers given from people inquiring about the phone. Secondly was the packaging; didn't have the standard Samsung screen protector on it , just a clear one."
yes,yes,yes,My sis had no problems upon now and can say that it seems to be like a good product.
no,no,no,"on the box it clearly states: AMERICAN SIM CARD ONLY....that should have been stated instead of ""International Verison"" don't you think?.....I'll be going to Jamaica in July (one of the main reason why i wanted an unlocked phone) and i can bet it won't work there..."
yes,yes,yes,I just love this phone but sometimes scren frozes but I knew it heard this decheck even before it's ok anything else I love it.
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone for the price. Good camera, doesn't do what the S6 or 7 can do, but is very reliable."
yes,yes,yes,Best of all phones
yes,yes,yes,It's features define its quality
yes,yes,yes,GREAT PHONE WATCH THE COMPANY
yes,yes,yes,Phone is easy to learn and the screen is easy to see. I love the Samsung Galaxy S5.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone for myself, and I could not be more satisfied. Like any other phone, I put mine to the test on the first day out of the box, already testing its water resistant and dust resistant capabilities. It has not failed me."
no,yes,no,The first phone was blocked. The second phone's mic is defective and unless you speak into the mic no one hears me. Also the phone is locked in Spanish and cannot add any other keyboard. Good Luck!
yes,yes,yes,the pone was uggly and used. I dislike the conditions that become the pone. I want the returns of my money. Thanks.
yes,yes,yes,This is a nice cellphone
no,no,no,The speaker volume is very low. I could not hear other party's voice in loud speaker mode though it is increased to full. I could not zoom the camera when default camera is used. I had to download another android camera app.
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone.. but honestly, within 3 months i was having issues. I am a fan of samsung but the fragile aspect has done it for me."
yes,yes,yes,"This is an AMAZING phone. Very fast, brilliant screens with a excelent camera. The new sensors adds a great set of features."
no,yes,yes,I just purchased a new Samsung Galaxy s 5 because I used have a s 3 before and dropped it in the sea water and it didn't work anymore. The s 5 is water resistant and i was told that it could be in 1-meter deep water for 30 minutes.
no,no,no,I had a horrible experience in having to return the phone because of missliding in the title put as universal unlocked version
no,yes,no,"I received the item ahead of time, i think i will credit it to the shipping company lazership. I think it is location dependent since lazership in GA is near our apartment. All of the functionality was working and there are no damage or scratches on the casing so i can confirm that the item is new."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Beware this phone does not support 4G LTE however the version which supports this is sold out at the time of this review. For me, 3G is fast enough."
yes,yes,yes,So far..I'm loving my new galaxy. An upgrade from my S3 so i'm still learning the new stuff. No problems at all since I received it.Works fine for me. Will update my review if I discover anything negative.
yes,yes,yes,"I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy 5S after reading reviews for both the new Samsung and Apple products. I am not a fan of Apple, and have several Samsung products (t.v., computer, DVD player etc) so I thought I would go with the Samsung phone. Glad that Best Buy has a 14 day return policy!!!"
no,no,yes,"I don't like the charger and phone don't display 4 Glte on the screen, only H, I think this phone was made to use in Europe . Plus the original charger is different , this one is the micro charger and not the Samsun charger."
yes,yes,yes,It is recommended as a seller and excellent product.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. It's on the AT&T network. But battery goes quickly when playing games.
yes,yes,yes,Purchased this phone as I do not buy from the carriers since they set them up and lock out lots of features. I refuse to fall to their communist ways. I wanted a fully functional phone and OS. This one serves that purpose and has worked great so far.
no,yes,no,"I 'm disappointed , it downloads very fast, I had to change the batteries several times"
yes,yes,yes,decent phone for the price
no,yes,yes,It didn't support 4GLTE and this info is not provided in the product description. I can't imagine a S5 with 2G in 2015....
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, with a really nice look. I've used for work and until now I haven't experienced any problems, some lags but I can live with that"
no,no,no,I bought this as UNLOCKED phone and when trying to put the sim card it asked me for the pin. Which means it is locked. Any idea?!!!
yes,yes,yes,Quality phone for the price
no,no,no,"Do not ever buy this or any samsung product, EVER. It is.impossible to operate within months of buying. Claimed warranty through TMobile and they charge 428 USD. Worst two companies out there, stay.away from both"
yes,yes,yes,Works great love it
no,yes,no,Working good is no bad
yes,yes,yes,no problems at all. quality is great.
yes,yes,yes,"Got the product in time, works as expected, it's great, love it, you should get one!."
no,no,no,Does not come with 4G. I had less than a year with this phone and the screen is now completely black for no reason. It just stoppedal working. You can't play your music directly when the phone is locked.
no,no,yes,"Died after less than five months of use. Even when it did work it would crash all the time when trying to do something as simple as upload a single photo to facebook. I have owned many Samsungs in the past without a problem, besides having a great camera this phone does nothing for me."
no,yes,no,"This phone is a problem to use in the US. I had to spend hours on the phone with my phone company to get it configured correctly. Also, when it comes to warranty, you don't get one. Had I known all the trouble, I would have spent the extra $200 and bought one from my carrier."
yes,yes,yes,It was not an original product
no,no,no,Buying this phone was just a waste of money! The speakers stopped working within 3 days of purchase and it also had so many other manufacture problems which I don't wanna go into details and waste my time here.
yes,yes,yes,"work perfectly, highly recommended"
yes,yes,yes,Excelente. Saludos desde Argentina.
no,yes,yes,The phone get my hands that do not start or load grabs
yes,yes,yes,"For people buying from Venezuela, this phone is great, it works just fine. Can recommend a 100%. I've been using it for 4 months now and can't complain about a thing, very resistant, colors look great, extra power saving options, and many other features that are a win-win when it comes to..."
yes,yes,yes,Todo re bien. Saludos
yes,yes,yes,Everything was right like expected
yes,yes,yes,Got this phone for my 17 yr old daughter and she love's it. No problems w/ shipping. Will buy one later for myself.
no,yes,no,"Exactly as advertised,the only thing that was on one of the reviews is that if you want to use it over sees ,you have to turn it on first in the u.s and let it work for few minutes ,with an us SIM card ."
no,no,no,"Worked for 6months, after that hangs oneday. trying to reboot by removing battery, but noluck. its not coming up at all. contacted samsung and they said its non us product, and they don't support. contacted local repair shop, they couldn't help on this. Its one of the worst mobile i had"
no,no,no,One of the worst product i have bought so far. The speaker phone on this suck and we cannot talk to any one who has a iPhone.
yes,yes,yes,A present for my mom. She loves it.
no,yes,yes,Only issue is the charger is for UK power outlets.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works perfectly. I love the meter pulse, is fantastic and allows me to see my stress level"
yes,yes,yes,PERFECT Phone... I love it!!
yes,yes,yes,"Had it for a year now and never regretted buying it., was worth the investment"
no,no,yes,Not the 4G version. I had a S2 before this and was expecting significant improvements in speed and screen management. I am quite deluded by it. Not a huge change. Screen is too wide to reach single handed and when typing get the wrong letters quite often and I continuously do mistakes because of it.
no,no,no,"signal bounces of and on like a Kangaroo on hot coal even when stood next to a wifi router, had it eight months and it no longer charges, I have to charge batteries using external charger then swap over. I should have just used the £400 I spent on this on stamps lol."
yes,yes,yes,nice phone so happy.
yes,yes,yes,This was for my sister in-law and she is still thanking me now. Which makes my wife happy. So I have nothing but admiration for this phone.

yes,yes,yes,Probably the fastest phone in the market in 2014.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent Phone, Poor Prime delivery"
no,no,no,wrong charger i dont think it's new
no,no,yes,"I bought this after an accident with my previous s5. Unfortunately for me, I never read the specs fully and found it was only 3G and not 4G as per my original phone. The clue is that it doesn't list LTE on the spec sheet whereas the G900F does support LTE."
yes,yes,yes,thanks for all your feedback i am so happy with my new phone .
no,no,yes,"This Phone DOES NOT have 4G, in the UK or anywhere else for that matter. It is the 8 core version originally made for South Korea. If you live in the UK its the G900f version you want."
yes,yes,yes,This is a bit of a rip off . It's only a 3G phone and can be bought at a fraction of this price on ebay. Be careful .
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic upgrade from the S3. I had a good look around at the other phones and am very glad I stuck with Samsung. The S5 is simply brilliant, the battery is much improved and can last the whole day without the constant worry of needing to charge it (theres even a ultra power save mode which..."

yes,yes,yes,Loved the experience of this purchase. Instant shipping! No hassle what so ever!
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works pretty well. My only complaint is that it does not pick up the 4G LTE network of my carrier. It only picks up 3g signals. It makes and receives call, emails and everything else flawlessly."
yes,yes,yes,"Have the phone for a week, enjoying it. the battery seems strong, size is perfect, touch good."

yes,yes,yes,Works under water! Cool!
no,no,no,"I just wanted to confirm my theory since it was hard to find online before I purchased it: If you get the S5 G900M, which is a North American International Model specifically, it will work with LTE on Cricket. I highly recommend the international version of this phone."
yes,yes,yes,It's great still getting used to the new configuration of apps and button placement
no,yes,no,After a year it started breaking down :( and I don't usually throw my phone to places...But it's an ok product...
no,no,no,"Returning this product because it does not support all of the bands this page says it does, including but not limited to the bands necessary to use 4G LTE service with T-Mobile. The actual box says it only supports these LTE bands: AWS/700/850/1900/2100/2600."

no,no,no,The Phone camera is not working well at all....I am sorry but I will have to return it.

yes,yes,yes,This is the greatest phone ever. Works perfectlyfine on my cricket plan I even get 4GLTE and I live in Texas
yes,yes,yes,"I was a bit intimidated when I first received it. Seemed like a long learning curve. Interface is powerful but clunky. Simple things are non-intuitive, like silencing the phone, flashlight, alarms, settings, answering calls (press and swipe finger rather than press)."
yes,yes,yes,Everything perfect! It works in Argentina with 4G!
yes,yes,yes,Received before promised date! Great!
yes,yes,yes,Works for Metro in Dallas. Love it!

yes,yes,yes,Like like my new 5
yes,yes,yes,There are a few things I don't love in the transition from the S3 to the S5. But there's no question it's a better phone. Everything was legitimate though if your just nervous about buying outside of a carrier as I was. I slipped in my t-mobile Sim card and everything worked.

yes,yes,yes,"Cons: phone talking voice quality not good at all. Space between the home key and screen too close, easily hit the ""recent app"" and ""backward"" button mistakenly. I used Galaxy S3 before and I felt S3 is better Pro: Photo is good. Support SD card."

yes,no,yes,Samsung quality and support is the best.

yes,yes,yes,The phone works pretty good
yes,yes,yes,I purchased this phone with the knowledge that it was suppose to have most carriers that were compaitable with the phone. The phone came perfect and very clean but however it was a certain carrier that I did not have.
yes,yes,yes,"My phone arrived nicely boxed, etc, however it did not meet the description or condition assigned ed to it.

yes,yes,yes,Works excellent here in Mexico.

yes,yes,yes,"It is unlocked, works with carriers that use SIM cards. I have T Mobile & it works fine."
yes,yes,yes,Perfect phone! I researched a ton before I bought this phone. Comparing band widths from this phone to T-mobile. So I could get 4G LTE some people in the reviews said they only got 4G so it was a bit of risk to see myself if it would work.. And it works perfect! I love it!
yes,yes,yes,Got it before expected. Its the perfect 4g lte version for brazil/argentina. All its perfect. I will update my review when im finih testing the phone.
no,yes,yes,"Wanted a new phone for a while and anything waterproof seemed worth the thought. I live in New York City and it works just like any other phone.

no,yes,no,"I've been using this phone for 2 months with a carrier from Argentina. It works very well, However any app that uses maps, except Google Maps, will crash and not work.

yes,yes,yes,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs."
no,yes,yes,I am sorry to say that the phone didnt switch on even after charging the battery for three days...
no,no,no,"They don't give you the sim card and your phone will not work correctly without it. They make you buy the SIM card separate, in order to get more money! I had to take my phone into the Sprint store in order for it to work correctly."
yes,yes,yes,Works perfectly well. Gave it 4 stars because my son had to go to Sprint to get a SIM card in order to be able to access cell data - could only access the Internet when on WI-FI.
yes,no,yes,"I normally do not write reviews, but I had to take time and give this product 5 stars. The phone is in excellent shape and it came with the Samsung charger and headphones.I took the phone to my Sprint store and they provided me with an SD card and the phone is working perfectly."

no,no,no,"i want to contact with seller, i need to change it, it doesnt work in Argentina the cellphone said ""unlocked for international version"" and the operative system cant use my SIM en Argentina, i need to change it for an UNLOCKED FACTORY SAMSUNG GALAXY s5 g900 M or G900 A, please contact me"

no,yes,no,"Phone had issues since we got it. Hard to hear, constantly fades in and out."
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone, Bootloader is not locked down as like AT&T or Verizon Phones so you can put in old Android Versions down to 4.4.2 using Odin. Updates to Marshmallow 6.0.1, make sure to load it manually, do not allow it to install automatically as the latest 6.0.1 version prevents from downgrading."

yes,yes,yes,Was exactly what I was looking for
yes,yes,yes,Beat smartphone I ever had at a great price

yes,yes,yes,"Working now, good buy."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone and Company I bought it from perfect perfect perfect no flaws just great phone.

no,yes,yes,"Bought a ""New"" phone from EZWIRELESS that seemed to be in great shape and new, as advertised. The same day I received it, it went into a case. Three weeks after purchase I noticed light bleed on the bottom corner of my screen."
no,yes,yes,"bought mine from chubbiestech. phone is ok, was advertised as in good condition, chrome is peeling off the trim of the screen, one good scratch across glass, but not too bad. the cable that came with it doesn't have enough plug to even go into the phone, so had to go get new cable to easily transfer..."
yes,yes,yes,Thank you for the perfect price and quality!
no,yes,no,"Problems charging after only a month, and the ""waterproof"" flap on the charging port got stuck in the charging port, so we had to remove it. I missed the returns date by 4 days and now am stuck with a piece of garbage phone."
yes,yes,yes,Simply everything I wanted in a phone.
yes,yes,yes,I changed providers and needed another phone because mine wouldn't work well even though it took a sim card. Had to downgrade because I just didn't want to rebuy what I had. This was bought used and in excellent condition.
yes,yes,yes,A very nice phone in beautiful condition purchased from LaptopAid. unfortunately I murdered it 3 days after it was delivered and the OEM replacement screen is as much as I paid for the phone.
yes,yes,yes,I have had the phone for a few months and it is not in good condition at all...
no,yes,no,"Worse phone! I gave it another chance after the previous Galaxy S5 just stopped working, not making or receiving calls. This phone works outside but not inside as far as calls are concerned. Im just going to wait till I can get an Apple."

no,yes,yes,Phone was dirty and chipped.
yes,yes,yes,Love the Samsung S5

yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Perfect for my needs. Works perfectly
yes,yes,yes,"Really great phone at an excellent price, but you should only order this only if you have prime. The first time I ordered the phone, it came in with NO LESS than 20 hard dents around the edges (I stopped counting after 20, there was 1 edge left to count)."
no,yes,yes,Phone does NOT connect to wifi
yes,yes,yes,I like the item but I sad it doesn't have symbols as 4s and others phone . That's all.
yes,yes,yes,I was looking everywhere for the best deals on this phone. I wasn't paying over $250. I found this gem for $187!! I'm using now. It's great
yes,yes,yes,"The phone came like it was brand new, nothing was out or order. The charger, ear buds, and USB cable are all new. The battery was not charged when I got the phone but that's a non-issue. I'm so happy with this phone, it's definitely an upgrade from my 4 year old galaxy s3."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. The camera is great quality. Easy to use. Fast operating system. Look no further....may your cell phone troubles be gone. But seriously this phone is worth the money!!!! I've done my research!
no,no,no,Received this phone and it wouldn't take a charge. Returning it.
yes,yes,yes,Ordered it on a Thursday evening and received it in Monday morning. Great quality.
yes,yes,yes,"Meh... it works, and it's great for my son to have a working phone, but boy, was it beat all to h$ll. A few scratches and dings? Sure, I expected that. This thing was missing most of the chrome paint from the perimeter, multiple dents, scratches on the screen."
yes,yes,yes,"I can finally count on the phone! The software base for the firmware was so out of date/Samsung issues that I needed to send it to Samsung, but I guess that happens with a phone this old."
no,yes,yes,The battery life for this phone is not good. I have to get another 1. I sent maybe 2 texts & checked Facebook once in the span of 3 hours & the battery went from 100% to 70-60%...If you don't have anywhere you need to be & basically keep it on the charger then it's fine.
yes,no,yes,This phone is working great and no problems at all
yes,yes,yes,Great product. ....
yes,yes,yes,My father in-law loved it!
yes,yes,yes,"A great phone! Shipped reasonable fast and arrived in ""like new"" condition, as promised, with all original packaging.

no,yes,no,Because the phone was broken and it doesn't have charger and it's was not unlocked
yes,yes,yes,The Android Pay on my new phone would not work. I made sure that the NFC was turned on and it still didn't work. I did some research and found out that the NFC antenna is integrated into the cell phone battery. My cell phone batter was missing the antenna.
yes,yes,yes,Came as expected almost brand new my daughter is very pleased as am I
yes,yes,yes,"Ordered black, but got a white phone. Don't really care about that. For a used phone, this thing was in great, great shape. I barely noticed the small dings in it. Got here fast, works great! Awesome experience!"
no,yes,yes,Promptly corrected problems to charger and ear bud deficiencies.
yes,yes,yes,"The unit that was sent wasnt new as advertised but decided to keep anyway since it is so hard to find a legitimate new galaxy s5 now. Be warned sellers online will advertise new and just clean and restore it, use a tool online to confirm headphone and charger counts are low and not in the thousands."
no,yes,no,had a problem with T-Mobile
no,no,yes,I want unlock this cellphone because i give to my wife she can't use please unlock for mi i can't use any sim card i don't now what is goin no please jelpme thanks for understundme .

yes,yes,yes,The item arrived but it drops my calls and loses service fast
yes,yes,yes,Everything about this phone met my expectations I've had it now for quite a while and have no problems at all I would recommend this to anyone
yes,yes,yes,"I really like my Samsung. Coming from having an LG this is a real upgrade. It occasionally freezes, but I think that's more service than anything. I love the large screen and all of the preinstalled apps. It takes great pictures as well."
yes,yes,yes,wonderful product no issues hooking up to my provider works just like a new one highly recommended.
yes,yes,yes,"First time to buy pre-owned phone. But it was very good. Much better than my expectation. There is one dent on the side of the phone, but no problem at all, in terms of functionality."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, looks brand new , works excellent"
yes,yes,yes,More worn than expected.otherwise good.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, excellent condition!"
yes,yes,yes,Works great so far. Simple and easy to make into a straight talk phone.
yes,no,yes,"I bought the S5 used, so I expected imperfections. Delivery and packing was good. Only issue I had is that there was an image burned into the screen, so it is always visible when using the phone. Thankfully the image is just a news app home screen rather than something offensive."
yes,yes,yes,"Not going to lie, I was a bit skeptical about buying a galaxy s5 for $200 because of not knowing what kind of condition the phone was in. I received my phone last Saturday and I have to say.... it's pretty much brand new...it's a few spots where the paint came off, but that's nothing.."
yes,yes,yes,"Exactly as described, I love my phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"Screwed me over after 7 months, to find out it was blacklisted. Thanks and never again"
no,yes,yes,"While I am enjoying the phone. I noticed their is a Crack in the glass. They failed to mention! Also, it tells me to check for water damage. So I'm not sure if this fell in water."
no,no,no,This phone when i got it you said 100% positive but the speaker is not working. What do you want me to do with it. Rahel
no,yes,yes,"purchased months ago and recently my phone was blacklisted. they were kind, but did nothing to help."
no,no,yes,My phone was working great until about a month into my purchase it started glitching. It first started out with some automatic shutdowns of apps that I was using and then escalated to opening up apps on its own and typing things randomly while I was texting as if someone else was on the phone.
no,yes,no,Phone works as described but after a while i noticed it freezes and lags like crazy. I have to keep shutting apps down otherwise it will not function. Never had this problems with S4
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works wonderfuly. Has really cool features, and is very durable"
yes,yes,yes,great price for the phone
yes,yes,yes,"I've used android since the GS1 all the way to the S5. At this point I got tired of the phone having a mind of its own, freezing, force closing, and wiggin out all the time. Switched to an Iphone 6 and can't stress how much better it is."
yes,yes,yes,My first smart phone and I love it. Very user friendly with fast response. Would highly recommend it!
yes,yes,yes,"Was a good buy. Looks new even though listed as used, working great."
yes,yes,yes,Great condition except the battery and the side scratches
yes,no,yes,"Gift for my wife, good condition"
yes,yes,yes,Came in quickly and works awesome except for one thing. The battrey gage is broken. I was not told of this. It always says 100% than it just dies because I never know how much charge it has...
yes,yes,yes,Worth buying been using the phone everyday
yes,yes,yes,"The phone was exactly as described by seller - gently used (I couldn't really tell at all) , worked perfectly on both T-Mobile and Cricket networks."
yes,yes,yes,Very nice it is beyond my expectations and almost new
no,yes,no,Phone would would not connect with provider so called provider. They made conference call with Samsung tech support who stated phone was defective so had to return it.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Working just fine so far.
yes,yes,yes,The reception was not good.
yes,yes,yes,I rate this item a 4 because it did say in the description it may have dings and scratches. But I didn't think it would be this many. I mean it is mainly on the top and bottom edges of the phone. So a case is a must. Other than that the phone is great!
no,no,yes,"Missing camera plate that's covers the lens, and rear-facing camera has dirt in it that show up n pictures and cannot be cleaned. This does not fall under the category of ""very good condition."""
yes,no,yes,Phone work great.just the right size all features are wonderful love it
no,no,no,"Update: 8-26-2015, Day 5 of torcher by phone... -- Tried clearing cookies, meany times, a slight effect maybe... -- Did two resets: -------- 1st; Up/Home and Power, till Android screen (you'll need reading glasses), reset to factory settings (this is the same screen for the clear cache, that I did..."

yes,yes,yes,Great product. Great Buy!
yes,yes,yes,Had one before. Replacement phone
no,no,no,had to return it b/c it was not correctly unlocked.
yes,yes,yes,Grandson is so excited to have a new phone.
yes,yes,yes,This phone out performs my HTC Thunderbolt by a mile. I got one for my wife as well.
yes,yes,yes,This product was exactly as I expected and at a great price. The only thing I had to was insert my card and set the phone up!
yes,yes,yes,"I really enjoy this cell phone. I have had really good experiences with android phones by samsung. I love all of the different things I can do on it, and coming from an iPhone I was worried I wouldn't have as many options as I had in the apple store but I have everything I need and it was very easy..."
yes,yes,yes,Its great item but im triying to configure it but i cant access my data service i make calls but no data. Help
no,no,yes,Constant black screen.
no,no,no,It was supposed to be unlocked and would work with ATT. It was locked and could only be used with Verizon phone service. Bad move on my part had to return it and was without a phone for almost 2 weeks.
no,no,no,"Only gave 5 stars so this'll be seen. Received this phone 2 weeks ago. Waited 2 weeks for a sim card i just got today, and was on the phone with a service provider for 3 hours just to find out after getting service and activating my phone the CHARGING PORT IS BROKEN. I cannot charge the phone I got."
no,no,yes,did not come with Verizon sim card like it stated in add (this cell phones are fully compatible with veirzon) I can not use it until I go to a Verizon store and hope they will give me a sim card
no,yes,no,I'm really disappointed with this the camera on this phone I bought it and didn't start using it until 8/16/16 for non contract service. Then the first pictures taken at wedding pictures are terrible! There's something wrong with the focus and I can't send it back because it's after the return date!
yes,yes,yes,works beautifully! I love it!
yes,yes,yes,"Fast, elegant, good camera."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone was a replacement for my husband's Galaxy S4 when the charging port broke. With prime, we got it next day and simply switched out the sim card with no major problems. I will give a small piece of advice for anyone who purchases this unlocked device to use with Straight Talk since this..."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone was in good working order, I took it to Tmobile to have it looked at and activated. They said it was a great phone for the price,"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone works great.
yes,yes,yes,The item is perfect
yes,yes,yes,Great phone as expected. Great service by seller.
yes,yes,yes,Great purchase! Really glad I got it.
yes,yes,yes,It was a gift and the person who received it loves it
yes,yes,yes,Great buy. Got it was as described and works perfectly. Would recommend.
no,yes,yes,"Good phone, however do not purchase it unless the phone was made for the carrier you currently have. If you have a carrier other than what the phone was made for, you will not have 4G service. Phone will also be very slow in operation. (or you'll have to switch your carrier service.)"
yes,no,yes,"Said it was compatible only with att. BUT WAS NOT. Purchased att go phone 45.oo account, WASTED that money. Supposed to b unlocked phone. NOT. after three trips to att, finally decided to go with Verizon b/c phone said Verizon. WORKS."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone!! Easy to use if you've previously owned a smartphone. Processor is extremely fast and the color is fantastic. I really like the size of the phone which is larger than my previous phone.
yes,yes,yes,was a Verizon phone worked great with straight talk
yes,yes,yes,great thinks child love it.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. I was wanting one I can use while I am in Germany and although it is a Verizon phone and continues to give me the ""not a Verizon sim"" message the phone still works with a Vodafone sim card."
no,no,yes,I am very dissatisfied!!! Phone came with no charger....no booklet... No Nothing but a phone case!!! ITS SCATCHED UP!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!!
no,yes,yes,"buy this phone and I came with the damaged camera , I really feel disappointed one of the things which a phone purchase is for the camera , I feel like I lost my money"
no,no,no,Can't get ahold of anybody to help me fix it because two different carriers told me different things wrong with one of the phones.it's been two months and I'm still using my broken phone.
yes,yes,yes,"My phone arrived yesterday, which was several days early. The phone looks nice except for some minor scratches in the area around the camera and a tiny chip on a corner, but that's to be expected with a phone that's not purchased new."
no,yes,yes,Phone came quick and as described! I had a gs3 so I thought it was time to upgrade because the 3 was really starting to slow down. I had straight talk with my s3 so all I had to do was switch my SD and Sim cards. My old number was already registered with the Sim card.
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone used and then used it my self for 2+ years. I LOVE THIS PHONE!! The only reason I am no longer using it is because I messed up the charging port :( This is one tough phone!
yes,yes,yes,"Phone came in great condition, my girl loves her new phone pretty much we are happy in how great condition the phone. However the shipping seems like it took a long time!! But will recommend to friends and family, very easy to activate the phone and everything!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,very nice good purchase
no,no,no,I still have problem charging my phone it won't charge some time and sometime it won't let me press the number
no,yes,no,Didnt come with the right charger. Alot more damaged then described. Lcd screen has a shadow on it.
no,yes,no,When on the phone the other line can't hear me because it echoes too loud.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is excellent and in great condition. I had no problems using my Italian SIM on the unlocked phone.
yes,yes,yes,Overall great phone little nicks on side but I purchase an unlocked I received a Verizon..
yes,yes,yes,"So happy I got the S5 !!! It is quick, has great security features, thin, big screen, absolutely no issues at all !!! Love it !!!"
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. This phone has locked up once in its first two weeks of operation. Hope thats not going to be an ongoing issue.
yes,yes,yes,I love all the accessories that came with the phone. The picture quality is great. It's not too big or too small. Great tools for everyday use and some fancy extra's. the battery life is exceptional as well
yes,yes,yes,"I'm loving this phone, enough said."
yes,yes,yes,Perfect phone!! Perfect just everything perfect love this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone & features. Still getting used to all of it's functions.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great, but the price drop quickly."
yes,yes,yes,one of the best phones out there. the phone was shipped with all the accessories.
yes,yes,yes,Got it really quick! Ugh wish I would have known about the Sims card!!! But I honestly love it!! It's almost in perfect conditions accept 2 small dents in the back of the phone.
yes,no,yes,"Arrived fast, works great with my Verizon service. I went to the Verizon store and they installed the sim card free of charge with no questions. Didn't change my rate plan. Verizon also copied over my contacts."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone absolutely love it ! I'm using straight talk & upgraded from my Verizon Galaxy s3 to this s5 & the transition was unbelievably smooth. I just removed my Sim & SD cards from my old phone & put them in my new one & never missed a beat. Would highly recommend !
yes,yes,yes,"Works very well. Looked a little crusty but sold as used. No real problems just a little dirty. I highly recommend this phone, it's so much better than the S3 I had that it's incredible. Use Firefox for best browsing on this."
yes,no,yes,"This phone really did as advertised. I wanted to buy a phone that could be carrier independent since I do a lot of travelling, and shortly after I bought this I got to take it with me to Mexico."
yes,yes,yes,Just the best phone ever... period the end. It lives up to the hype. All kinks worked out either by Samsung or verizon. The 5.0 update has been fixed because Verizon waits to release them after they see how it works on other providers and doesn't update until after they are fixed.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. I bought it to go on Verizon prepaid. If you are doing that, make sure you take it to an actual verizon store NOT an authorized dealer. But it's fast,great battery life and charges quickly."
yes,yes,yes,"Incredible deal! I love this GS5 along with a stellar offer for an unlocked Verizon Phone. Now I can use this phone at my own discretion with providers without being bound to a contract. The phone is truly water resistant and for the science gurus, hydrophobic skinned."
yes,no,yes,"A stellar phone compared to many out there on the market. It is slightly bigger than the S4, but not much difference. It is incredibly fast, very light and has removable battery and storage (for music, movies, etc.); I had a 64gb Samsung micro SD card installed with plenty of movies."
yes,yes,yes,"This was exactly what the description stated. I love this phone it works for everything I wanted and more. The only thing I found to be negative is the packaging states it contained a Sim card, but there was not one in the box."
yes,no,yes,"Love the S5. I bought an unlocked 'Verizon' phone that did not work at first on my ATT plan; but ATT chat help gave me the correct data to put in the VPN settings and got that working. Then, I could not get Google Playstore (and thus, no apps) and Best Buy Geek Squad (they are awesome!"
yes,yes,yes,"I knew it was a large phone before I bought it, but I wanted a large display for internet acess. It is on the border of being too large for a phone after you put a good case on it but everything else that is great."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! It works awesome! It was easy to register with straight talk from the instructions that were given. All I had to do was get a straight talk Verizon SIM card. I would buy this phone again!
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone. Works well.
no,yes,yes,Phone bought as unlocked. However Sim not recognized
yes,yes,yes,Going from a galaxy 4 to 5 there is a lot of changes to the phone that won't transfer over I didn't know that so I lost a lot of data. Make sure you back up your 4 well before switching them I was unable to keep my Sim card from my 4 so I could do a transfer from one phone to another phone transfer.
no,no,no,The phone is completely locked to Verizon and not to AT&T and T-Mobile as you advertised and is no use to me unless I can somehow afford to unlock it. every sin card I insert is not recognized and all I get is this is not a Verizon sim card. Neither was there any headphones with the purchase.
no,yes,no,It was a new phone but there no authentication from company like warranty card or user manual. Made in China and sound quality was very bad. Charger cable or USB cable was generic. It seemed to me it was a bootleg phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, We have 3 of them. We love the water proofing quality since we live in Arizona and are always out at the pool. WE DONT swim with it. But it protects it against and occasional splash, etc. The phone is plenty for what I need, I love the android system and the open aspect of it."
no,yes,no,USB charger doesn't match to the Phone it so disappointed
no,no,no,"BEWARE OF FALSE ADVERTISING!!!! THIS PHONE IS NOT UNLOCKED!!!! ITS VERIZON ONLY!!! I bought this as Christmas gift for my girlfriend who has metro PCS. I was under the impression this phone was UNLOCKED, so she would be able to use it. To our surprise, that's a big NOPE."
no,yes,no,It's was boy a bad phone at all I just like gold and they didn't have the right charger
no,no,yes,This is not unlocked for the browser
yes,yes,yes,"Got this for my GF and she didnt like it so we sent it back and got the note 4 instead OMG! I am an Apple fan but if I ever left the Apple ecosystem the note is the phone I would get Better camera, better display, and a rational file system!"
yes,yes,yes,I love this s5 however the charging port cover on these phones falls off so easily then they are no longer waterproof
yes,yes,yes,zippy fast...love Samsung phones!!
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, wish Verizon had the latest Android updates that AT&T does. My AT&T S5 is two operating sysems ahead of a new Verizon S5."
yes,yes,yes,"Great cell phone.. nice looking, worked as soon as it became active."
no,yes,no,I am very upset with this product because I have to fix a phone that I have not ever get to use. The Samsung galaxy s5 came on for 10 minutes and then just shut down and would not come on. I need my money back
no,no,no,its a wonderful phone but does not work with my carrier like it says it does im very displeased. refund please?
yes,yes,yes,Realy greate Phone it works fine
no,no,no,"not even 45 days old and screen has pink tint and ""jumps"" making it unusable."
yes,yes,yes,Had purchased another phone from other seller that did not work. They did not work with me to get replaced. Paid the difference for this one. The VERY small price difference was worth the investment. Got the phone in new box. All parts are new and the phone works great.
yes,yes,yes,Works with Verizon in the US. Had to switch my phone after the last one broke. Recommend you buy a micro sim as it does not come with it.Great phone and brand new
yes,yes,yes,"great device. exactly what i was looking for. runs fast, great looking display, excellent camera quality. the only reason it isn't 5 stars is due to its battery life... have to charge it at home and then again for a bit at work, otherwise it doesn't make it thru the day."
yes,yes,yes,I live this Version S5 model.AWESOME FEATURES
no,no,yes,It did not come with any of its original accessories and a yellow death touch on the bottom of the screen.
yes,yes,yes,Happy with this phone .
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone! I received earphones and a car charger as a bonus. The car charger only worked for about two weeks, and for some reason the heart rate monitor on the back below the camera can never read my pulse."
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from Galaxy S4 to Galaxy S5. I now wish I had stayed with the S4 or had looked at the S6. Really do not like the wider power/data cable. Also could do without the little power cord door - just something else to break and now an extra step every time you charge or disconnect.
yes,yes,yes,"Wonderful device, exceeds all of my expectations! Have not had any issues with the device!"
yes,yes,yes,So far it is just what I wanted. I did need to order a sim card kit from Straight talk to activate the phone. That cost was .98 cents. Great phone. I purchased new phone and received a new phone. Very satisfied. I up graded from S3 to this S5. Again very happy with the phone.
yes,yes,yes,Item arrived as described and in good condition
yes,yes,yes,For about a third of the price of a newer phone this does everything I need and more. Very satisfied.
yes,yes,yes,Very good. Has many features.
no,no,yes,I purchased the black version of this phone and received a brand new phone. I purchased this phone and received a phone that's been used. There is dirt and tape inside the phone's back compartment. Battery terminals show use.
yes,yes,yes,Its the best phone i ever had
no,yes,yes,"Great phone if the selfe camera and sensor wasn't bad, screen would dim until you pushed down on the eye, then brighten up."
no,no,no,I rarely leave a poor review but I've had this phone for a few weeks now and it has been very glitchy. I have the same service provider I did before. This phone is an upgrade from what I had. It drops calls and my call quality is poor.
yes,yes,yes,I got this to replace my Droid and this is not as easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,"Item listed as in ""Used - Very Good Condition"" - phone works fine but the camera lens is all scratched up. All pictures come out fuzzy and blurry.... Would not have bought it if I knew the camera was not in good functioning condition......."
yes,no,yes,After I FIGURED OUT HOW TO MAKE IT COMPATIBLE WITH STRAIGHT TALK.....it was good. Gets a little laggy sometimes though even though brand new
yes,yes,yes,I was very wrong with this phone I got a Chinese model of samsung s5. For all those who want to check if it is an authentic samsung mark this code * # 0 * # must arrive in menu to check the authenticity of samsung
no,no,no,"The product was used, had been destroyed, with the bad video card, the days began to fail, they sell it as new when it is not so, do not be fooled"
no,no,yes,"Charger port was broken when I received it. Could only use phone with a Verizon small charger not the longer S5 adapter, phone actually came with. Cost me an additinal $75 to get fixed, disappointed but needed a phone. However, great price for what I received."
no,yes,yes,It didn't fit snug
no,yes,no,"phone works , but some apps I downloaded (some more than once) won't work. I have to send it back. I went to the Verizion store, they updated the out of date operating system , but it still won't load the apps."
yes,no,yes,"My husband loves the phone. The ad stated 'new, unopened, sim card included', however the box was opened and there was no sim card. The phone is great though."
no,no,no,"Phone is not operating properly. Screen is blinking out, cutting off and speaker is not working. Will not be purchasing a phone from again."
yes,yes,yes,just as described arrived early and works great
yes,no,yes,"Unfortunately, I got this phone. A good phone but the one I got had reception problems. I own another, exact same one, and it works fine. I got another as an extra for another number I use for work."
no,yes,no,"I really loved this phone at first, but I only had it for 3 months before it started to be impossible for people to hear me on it. I just had to replace it."
no,no,no,Product in bad condition ... the screen when it is white color are 2 tones (white and beige) ... disappointed
yes,yes,yes,great new phone - new box - all the factory stickers and cords
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! Was used overseas..
no,no,yes,Just received the phone and it turns out that it is not a verizon phone. It is an unlocked phone and verizon had a difficult time activating it. It did activate however and we'll have to see if everything is as expected. I seem to be getting 3g signal only.
no,no,no,"No problems encountered with order/delivery. Unfortunately both phones had software issues, unable to factory reset due to screens freezing. Afraid to re-order for fear of getting another pair of phones with the same problems."
yes,yes,yes,"Bought mine brand new and it works as it should, not the persons fault but the battery does die faster than the knock off brands and it gets a bit warmer than my liking. Other than that so far it works great. :)"
yes,yes,yes,"The 2017 review by Stephen S is very good and I agree on all counts. The other thing I would add is the GPS capabilities of this phone. It's one of the few that can see all THREE sets of birds, the US (most useful) Russian AND Chinese."
yes,no,yes,"One thing the S5 has that its newer and significantly more expensive alternatives in the 'S' line do not: a removable, replaceable battery. To me, this matters, because I like using an extended battery. With an extended battery, I don't have that nagging impulse to constantly be tied to a cord."
no,no,no,Camera not working 100% it's blury
yes,yes,yes,Great phone... cheap price
no,yes,yes,there was no sims card when the listing said so
no,no,no,Issues with callers not being able to hear me and often just disconnects. This poses huge problem for me because this is my business and personal phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone in great condition, set up easily and works well. Very happy"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone itself is fine. The issue I had was ordering a phone that was labeled as ""NEW"" but when it arrived it was obvious that it wasn't new. It looked to be a display model. It cosmetically looked fine."
no,no,yes,I bought this phone yesterday. I have a 4g plan and for some reason the battery isn't holding good. And whenever I'm outside my house not using WiFi it's always saying no network connection an that it's not a version sim card which it's not .
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good. The phone seems a tad bit light and made of a different metal, but works well so far. I've had it for 2 weeks now."
no,no,yes,"Screen burned out, had weird arabic app that I can't uninstall."
yes,yes,yes,need help with phone
no,yes,no,I like the phone but the top speaker did not work at all.
yes,no,yes,Exactly the phone I wanted (and needed). I'm sure an S6 or S7 is faster but I'll take having a removable battery and a micro SD slot any day.
no,no,yes,Samsung Galaxy S5 I ordered has a very short battery life. Approx 30 mins of use drains battery 30-40%
no,no,no,The phone is OK. Only problem is I was expecting an unlocked phone but what I got is not unlocked. It is locked by vrizon.
no,yes,no,"returned due to warranty information and problem with the outer shell of original back, warped."
yes,yes,yes,Phone is absolutely perfect nothing wrong with it!
no,yes,no,"I would not recommend buying from MobileSpree. The phone's charging port does not work and SD cards do not mount properly. I would recommend dishing out the extra cash and buying from whatever company you use (Verizon, T Mobile, etc.)."
yes,yes,yes,This phone doesn't stay charged for long. I have been having problems with it since I purchased it in April of 2016. They stated they would need me a another battery for this phone which I still haven't gotten.Now the plug that you plug in the wall only half way works.
no,no,no,"Was really looking forward to updating my old Samsung phone, and I was a little disappointed with how many problems I have been having with this phone. Turns off randomly, screen doesn't always turn on, along with other frustrations."
no,no,no,Phone was not unlocked. States that it was it is ineligible to be unlocked because its still under contract.
yes,yes,yes,"Worked as expected, have been using for over a month, no issues. Very happy with product and seller."
no,no,yes,Only the battery does not stay longer than 1 day
no,no,no,"So here I bought a phone thinking it was going to work for AT&T since it Does mention that it is unlocked and you're able to use it with AT&T sim cards. NOPE. I got the phone and I put the card in. I turned on the phone and it goes Directly to a Screen saying ""No Verizon sim card..."" and that's it."
yes,yes,yes,"I've just receiving device and you download some applications and came off the device and appeared to me the Samsung logo on the screen and all the friends lost phone numbers, pictures and applications and PIN numbers do not recommend anyone try this device"
no,no,no,This phone is NOT Verizon compatible as described. Verizon was mentioned in the description at least 2 times. Very misleading and extremely annoying. The phone seemed to be absolutely fine...just NOT Verizon compatible.
yes,yes,yes,Works perfectly. Excellent functionality.
yes,yes,yes,Phone works extremely well
yes,yes,yes,I am really enjoying my new phone.
no,no,yes,Screen broke on the first day
yes,yes,yes,Replacement phone for my wife. She loves it!!
no,no,yes,"After carefully researching what was on the market, I decided on what was not the newest of its line. This model has a replaceable battery, which the S7 does not. The SAR measurement of electronic radiation is about one-third that of the S7."
no,no,no,"Very disappointed in this purchase. This phone claims to be gsm meaning it works with at&t. According to the info posted all you have to do is switch the sim card. When i did that the phone immediately said ""this must be a verizon sim card."
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely love the phone, but can't give the provide five stars. The charger that came with the phone did not work. Also it was Prime shipping, but it took a full week to arrive (I got a notice it would be 2 extra days...ended up being 3 extra). FYI..."
yes,yes,no,It says it is unlocked but it isn't!! I originally bought this phone as a Verizon pay-as-you-go phone. But then I decided to switch to TracFone. So when the phone came I inserted the TracFone SIM in the phone. I couldn't set it up because it said it was a non-Verizon SIM card.
yes,yes,yes,My daughter loves her new phone she got for Christmas. It came as expected with all items intact and functioning perfectly so far. Very pleased so far with this product!
yes,yes,yes,"This phone works like it's new our the factory! Only setback was the charger port cover won't stay properly unless you fiddle with it a bit. Overall, great phones!"
no,no,no,Screen Stopped working in a week of using this phone
yes,yes,yes,"Like the phone real well but the charger that came with it does not work,"
yes,yes,yes,Very good buy. I have no problem with it
yes,no,yes,"I purchased this case for my sister, and so far she loves it. it fits snug, and the padding around the screen helps protect the screen when dropped."
no,yes,no,Screen is green. It always flashes green no matter what the brightness is set at. Runs very slow and constantly freezes. But I needed the phone and it texts and calls like it is supposed to...
yes,yes,yes,for a samsum i dont like it breack very fast!!! i am not happy
yes,yes,yes,"very good Samsung Galaxy S5 , i would rate 4 stars"
yes,yes,yes,The phone works great. But the charger is defective. Using my old one with the new cord
yes,yes,yes,The equipment is very nice because the price I've paid.
yes,yes,yes,This is a awesome phone.
no,yes,no,Loved the phone. Sound was terrible. People had difficulty hearing me.
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone, I am using it with Trac Phone plan, No problems switching. Loading contacts from the other phone was a breeze!"
yes,no,yes,Everything was great love the phone but the charger stopped working and after way to much back and forth in Email they finally got me another and it only worked for a little while and now waiting for another...
no,yes,no,I received this phone. It was in great shape but the charger is not the one that comes with the phone. Very slow to charge
yes,yes,yes,"This particular phone had an internal problem. Had to send it back. Ordered another from another vendor. Same make and model. New phone works perfectly. Just got a bad one to start I guess. Great phone if you get a good one, but sometimes these things happen."
no,no,no,This was a Christmas gift for my wife and after one month of use the phone stopped working. The images on the screen started scrolling upward and the whole screen gets distorted...I'm definitely sending this back.
yes,yes,yes,Wasn't worth a cap from the start!
no,no,no,"Phone's battery will not charge with any cable. I have to switch the battery out of a broken phone, charge the battery up inside of the broken phone, and then place the battery back inside of this phone."
no,no,no,"This phone is not unlocked, I bought for a present, it should work with at&t and but it doesn't work. Also I order as a gift and I write a note and they didn't sent the note."
no,no,no,"My phone comes with broken case, broken in several places. So you can not get to the water. And it looks very ugly"
yes,no,no,"This was a great phone until the G7 came out. Started having issues shortly after and my phone has had several updates since, which have been slowing it down a great deal. The one issue I have is that this phone is unlocked by Verizon and you will be stuck with all of Verizon's default applications..."
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful condition on this phone thank you VERY much
no,no,no,"This phone was not unlocked as stated, very disappointed am having to pay extra to get it unlocked as I don't live in US. :("
no,yes,no,This phone started great but quit working very fast and I had to buy another phone and I have no insurance.
yes,yes,yes,Perfet very good phone
no,yes,yes,"Phone was still locked to Verison. I had to sort out unlocking the myself. The portable mobile hot spot feature appears to have been permanently disabled by Verizon. Even after unlocking the phone, the feature is still blocked. Asides this, the phone is as good as new."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent purchase but had to return it.
yes,yes,yes,Item condition came as described.
yes,yes,yes,Phone is good but did not come with a sim card.
no,no,yes,Was not unlocked as it said it was.
no,no,no,i would have given five star but am yet to see 4G on my device all i see is H+ and every time i restart i get a clear reminder that the Sim is not a verizon sim and my home key after a press on it the screen takes about 4 seconds to start up the screen.
no,yes,yes,I think I got a lemon. Had nothing but repairs on this thing. When hubby broke the screen we gave up and got a different phone. My friend has the same kind of phone and loves it. He even showers with his phone and abuses it in other ways constantly and has never had any trouble.
no,no,yes,this cell phone is not working.....in one month this phone was damage
yes,yes,yes,great device and order
no,yes,no,Terrible China made knockoff
yes,yes,yes,We just love the design and the fits application app. Also a lot of fun with way it design
no,yes,yes,with h2o no 4g possible. though mentioned in details. buy only for verizon but not for other providers.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is the best Android based phone I have had. It is very fast and has solid response. I bought it for my Straight Talk account. Switching phones was incredibly easy. All I had to do was swap out my SIM card form my previous Samsung phone and everything was automatic after that.
yes,yes,yes,Because it functions just as good as my 1st G5 and cosmetically looked like new.
yes,yes,yes,Perfect! Great Deal
yes,yes,yes,Got phone as a gift. Works fine. She is happy with it . I bought things to protect it . She dropped and cracked screen on last phone.
yes,yes,yes,Only been using for a short period but so far works great and I love it.
yes,no,yes,Product had severe cosmetic defects and the charging port malfunctioned the day it arrived. I had to purchase a wireless charging pad and wireless cover before I could even give it to my daughter for her birthday.
no,no,no,"I usually don't do reviews, however, I ordered this phone for my son's birthday and the data wouldn't connect. I ordered a replacement and the data on it won't work. You can make a call and use the wifi but that's it. The phone isn't responding to touch and the texting won't even work properly."
no,yes,no,"Received an ATT version, not Verizon. This phone was returned. The quality of the phone was good."
no,no,no,"This phone regularly drops reception unless in direct line to a tower, and even then will drop to 1X for no obvious reason. Also the screen has developed a glitch where the bottom half takes on a scratchy, digital distortion right before the screen fades out and whenever you wake it back up."
yes,no,yes,I own one already and it's just right for me. this one is for my 15 yr old for Christmas.
yes,yes,yes,leary of Samsung galaxy at this time
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. May be a little behind as far as generations go, but it still functions above average. The battery leaves more to be desired, but all the useful features really balance out the negatives."
yes,yes,yes,I just love it! And the price was GREAT TOO!
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works fine. The problem is the screen had a text window burned into it. It's not immediately noticeable, but with bright backgrounds it is. I guess I cant complain too much since it was about $50 cheaper than most of the ones I looked at. Still, I'm taking an extra start off because of it."
no,yes,no,Phone received was not unlocked.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome. Woke right up witn an existing activated Verizon sim card.
yes,yes,yes,"An amazing phone, great buy!"
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I am so happy I purchased this phone. I use trac phone and it works great with it!
yes,yes,yes,Finally took the plunge & upgraded phone & service plan after 15 years....and I am BLOWN AWAY at the incredible reception in my area- almost all my friends & service people that come to the house get ZERO reception..
yes,yes,yes,It was brand new and works great! Would buy from them again!!
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and great price
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone;works great
yes,yes,yes,Good price for a great little phone.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent would buy this again
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product and service
yes,yes,yes,Product met all of my expectations
no,yes,no,"Well.... phone is is decent shape but that's it. I wish I could put a pic of what I actualy recieved. Not in factory box as pictured, 2.0 inste a d of 3.0 charger, and no ear buds period. Definantly false advertising but I g you just get ripped off some times..."
yes,yes,yes,"Had an issue with the phone, and they were great about replacing with a new one. TooK a little longer than expected, but was glad for a no hassle return."
yes,yes,yes,"So far this product has been awesome :) The port to recharge kinda sucks, tight to open but oh well. Great camera! :)"
no,yes,yes,The title didn't say it was a Verizon phone and I stupidly didn't research further into it. I can not use it and am trying to sell it.
yes,yes,yes,I nee to retun dis phone
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased 2 of these, one worked perfectly and the other was defective, I sent the other one back for a refund, I love this phone very easy to navigate through all the functions. The camera has a lot of features and takes good pictures. I would recommend this phone and seller!"
yes,yes,yes,love my Samsung Galaxy S5 it's works well and very fast
no,no,no,I purchased this as a lesser expensive alternative to buying a new phone from Verizon. The first week or so it worked just fine...then the problems began. The button that brings the screen back to life doesn't work and requires upwards of 15 to 20 presses before I can see my screen.
no,no,no,Phone wasn't charging had to buy a next charging port. The charger was draining the battery when I plug it.
no,no,no,If I could give zero stars I definitely would. Have alot of problems with sell phone less then a year old and broke. The phone originally overheated and wasn't working. Now I can't get a refund. This is really ridiculous.
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone. It's just like the xbox360. Not the newest nor the oldest device but, the best S series created"
yes,yes,yes,I've had this for a month or so now and works well. Im sure there is a way to update the android version but for now it is locked at 5.0. My previous s5 was updated to the top version though this is less twitchy than the newer one.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone was in perfect mint condition, not a scratch or flaw anywhere. Phone is works perfectly, took it to Verizon and had a sim installed with no problems. Definitely will do business with Celluar Professor again!"
no,no,no,"Battery was broken, needs to be charged three times per day if not on ultra-power saver mode."
no,no,no,"Phone was not unlocked as said in the description. Also it does not perform like a new phone should, the battery does not seem to last and it sometimes shuts completely off at 15%,20%,25%."
yes,no,yes,I made an extensive effort to determine if this was the phone for me. I wanted USB 3.0 capabiity and a removable battery in a Samsung phone...this was it! I bought new although this phone had been replaced by the S6 and S7...this new S5 was the perfect price. I'm very happy with this phone!
yes,yes,yes,This phone is an improvement over my previous phone. It charges very quickly and holds the charge well. It is a nice size and the camera is very responsive even in low light situations.
no,yes,no,Ordered for a friend. He loved the phone only problem was the charger didn't work must have been defective. This is why the four star rating. Wasn't a biggy he had another charger plug. Was why no one was contacted.
yes,yes,yes,Very nice phone and a great deal. All you need is a Verizon carrier and no contract!
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung Galaxy! With all the worry about the new ones exploding or catching on fire, why not go with an older model? I love mine. This one is a replacement for my older one that I dropped and broke. It works smoothly and I am pleased with my purchase."
yes,yes,yes,Yes got it. Thank u
yes,yes,yes,This product is a great product.
yes,yes,yes,great phone at a great price
yes,yes,no,I have found some defects on this phone. For some reason this phone takes longer to send an email but my HTC droid incredible sends emails faster.
yes,yes,yes,"multimedia/picture texting never worked, I tried everything! it goes off and come back on when it feels like it, its got a mind of its own. No Good!"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. love it.
yes,yes,yes,Was so good . It's so good to buy for here.
yes,yes,yes,"Nice, too good for a very cheap price, there are some little problem though but over all, I love it!"
yes,no,yes,I like it the features are awesome.
yes,yes,yes,I really love this phone. Bought it used. No damage and it works as though it is new.
no,yes,no,The S5 wants you to be safe. It has this horrible feature called car mode. When in this mode it will reject calls and texts so you will not be distracted while driving. Car Mode activates any time this phone is paired with any Bluetooth divice.
no,no,no,"Advertised as ""unlocked"" but when I took it to my service provider we learned it was not unlocked. Service provider attempted to unlock phone but several features (including data ) don't work."
yes,yes,yes,"It came on time and looks brand new, no dent or scratches and screen is clean. it came in looks like original box but accessories are after market one and work fine. I had the hard time to make work on Tracfone even so Verizon said Tracfone should be able to activate the phone but they didn't want..."
yes,yes,yes,Completely satisfied!!
yes,yes,yes,It has worked well for me and is a good cheaper alternative
yes,no,yes,Slow at times but overall a great purchase and we'll worth the money spent.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone works perfectly thus far, no issues at all."
yes,yes,yes,"So far, this has been a purchase I have not regretted at all. High quality product."
no,no,yes,I could not get the phone to unlock in the Caribbean ......
no,no,yes,"I bought a NEW phone instead of USED and paid hefty price They show the box with a new phone, but it was not in the original packaging. Seemed like used."
no,no,yes,For one I had to switch from my carrier which was at&the to Verizon than they say it's not the original charger for the phone and it was late getting here .. but besides the odds I do like it
yes,yes,yes,Great phone works well and is better than expected but it just doesn't get 4G LTE network with T-Mobile everything else is great
yes,yes,yes,"The phone came functioning properly, in excellent condition and the expected time. I recommend it!"
no,no,no,if the phone is factory reset does that means my samsung account wont work?? because i put in my account and it says processing failed
yes,yes,yes,"is very good the service offered his shop, deserves 5 stars"
no,yes,yes,Storage was full and Sim card from a different provider was not compatible.
yes,yes,yes,This is basically a brand new phone. I received all original packaging and Samsung accessories. The camera is crisp and takes great pictures; I love it. The only reason I gave it a 2 star rating is because I have permanent messages on my status bar for the following reasons: * This phone is...
yes,yes,yes,"great condition, works fine but dissapointed it so bloated with software"
no,yes,no,"Did not know it was a version phone, so I can't use. But it came on time. Just need to send back to get other carrier."
yes,no,yes,The heart rate monitor does not work and I had already left the us a few days when I found out.... also the samsung codes don't work on it. It picks up service fine though
no,no,no,It says unlocked but you cannot use for GSM carriers.they try to convince that you can but it will not work.
no,no,no,very worst phone it s said 4g but is not 4g this one working 2g my phone showing E symbol i am try down load Facebook showing error i have make a video call really worst anyway i connect to WI FI same problem
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone for my friend and he love it no problem activating it on other network beside being from Verizon
no,yes,yes,It works with AT&T also. go to settings ->More networks-> change to GSM\LTE Network.
no,yes,no,I really like the phone but hate that I can't get or send MMS messages with it. I wish I could return it and am going to try to sell it.
yes,yes,yes,"I never' ve can to take my voice mails, since, supposedly this phone hasn't it original sistem. I think I didn't a good deal.."
no,no,no,"Bad, inhibits the phone is not unlocked. Only works with Verizon and to top it received on April 08 in Venezuela (not the fault of the supplier), I have no way to return it. Very disappointed."
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone. I find the battery dies a bit fast though.
no,no,no,"FALSE CLAIM of UNLOCKED phones, these are LOCKED to Verizon, and will not start up with a SIM card other than Verizon!!!"
yes,yes,yes,I got exactly what I wanted ! The only downside is it did not come with the original charger.
yes,yes,yes,"Works great no problems, thank you thank you thank you"
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful and amazing so much better than I expected
yes,yes,yes,"Phone OK and a LOT cheaper than Galaxy 7, but Battery life is no better than Galaxy 5 - about 1/2 day at most if I do't use it."
yes,yes,yes,My husband loves his s5 it works great thanks
no,no,yes,The front camera has something in it so makes the front camera have black blob at the bottom of each picture. And this is just a picture of my wall nothing else.
yes,no,yes,"Great phone with one catch: If you are not going to use a Verizon SIM card, you are going to run into some challenges. 1. After a factory reset, the phone will ask for a Verizon SIM card to be used to activate. You can bypass this and activate via WIFI. 2."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone. Just wish the fact that the charger cover was missing would have been included in the ad.
yes,yes,yes,"I used this for BYOP for Tracfone and it works amazing. This is an excellent phone and has lots of features including the 16 pixel camera. This phone is fast and offers everything I need. From what I've read, this is water resistant unlike the Samsung Galaxy S6 which has tons of problems."
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. I am awaiting my sim card to start using it as a cell phone. All the other parts of the phone works well.
yes,no,no,Like the item but it is not working now.
yes,yes,yes,"It works well, but I can't eliminate the advertisement that I don't use Verizone. I think that they have unblocked the cellphone but not 100% good."
no,no,yes,One star was junk but was able to get my money back.
no,no,no,Dislike it didn't work :-(
no,no,no,This phone was a Verizon phone and Verizon continues to show up with a full screen of Verizon and message that phone does not have a Verizon sim. Phone also loses service occasionally and has to be rebooted to get it back. Other than these couple of issues phone does work ok.
yes,yes,yes,very nice works great not a 5 because it is not new
yes,yes,yes,Its a good Phone if Its unloked May work in everywhere
yes,yes,yes,Just got product in today. As of so far I'm very impressed. Thank you. Came in fast and in excellent condition. I will recommend to anyone.
no,yes,yes,It was supposed to be straight talk compatible for AT&T. It works but Where I use it in WV where my other phone worked it does not. Very disappointed a was of money I will go back to my old phone.
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good, hard to get use to it does much on its on"
yes,yes,yes,Exactly as promised.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, works great, - only needed to get SIM card (got SIM card for free from my cellular provider)."
yes,yes,yes,Fast! Just as described.
yes,yes,yes,Is very good phone i like it
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, great condition"
yes,yes,yes,The phone has a lot of issues and seems like it's still connected to Verizon. I can't access my voicemail because it's not a Verizon phone number. I'm displeased.
yes,yes,yes,It's a great little phone lot of functions lit of features and easy to use. Still need to learn how to use some of its future but all in all great phone.
no,no,yes,"phone worked, screen cracked on both sides of screen top to bottom, small horizontal marks top to bottom. pic still good,"
no,no,no,"I am very disappointed with the Samsung s5 g900v it keep shutting off each time I make or receive a call, I can not receive picture text ,sometime I don't get WiFi on the road"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, still using it even though it isn't the newest model. Love the waterproof aspect. I'm able to mount it to my motorcycle, even in the rain"
no,yes,yes,"the phone just came in today and i love it, my pnly problem is with the charging. i plug in the charger and it will charge then stop charging, and it will continue doing this"
yes,yes,yes,Perfect like new phone. Very happy
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great. No problems what so ever.
yes,yes,yes,Was spot on and a good reliable phone
yes,yes,yes,Wife loves it. Came from iPhone 4.
no,no,yes,This phone was purchased and was NOT able to be put on my account due to the phone being on the sellers account still and in a two year contract so I bought a phone that can not be used and is just money sitting on a counter.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is awesome. It met n exceeded my expecations. I love it!
no,no,yes,the phone couldn't be activated and never will be able to get activated again.
yes,yes,yes,It's pretty much the same set up as my tablet which made it very easy for me to navigate through. Phone is in fantastic condition and it arrived a day earlier than originally scheduled.
yes,yes,yes,What a major jump from my Galaxy S3! Samsung's Galaxy S5 is such a beast that the smartphone has features that you want to use for your daily lives. The best bits from the Galaxy S5: Highly recommended this as your replacement for your outdated mobile phone or for new smartphone users. ^_^
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo is slightly better than the Galaxy A5 (2016) in specs. The price I got the phone for was great (C$360 Unlocked) and it works as good as any Galaxy S-lineup phone would.
no,no,no,"Would not recommend, i bought one and im so sorry i did. It doesn't charge properly, when it does it only lasts a few hours, freezes, screen wobbles, screen broke in 2 days even though it was never dropped or misused in any way. Put me off Samsung, wi never get another one."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone for little over a month and as most of the reviews say, the battery life is awful. Everything else about the phone is great, but the battery life is horrendous and overheats quickly when using any of the features that a smart phone is used for."
yes,no,yes,"The appearance of Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo is almost identical to the previous version of Galaxy S5, towards which users had mixed feelings. Some of them were satisfied by the new design while others didn’t like the plastic build, nor the bold decision to go with a perforated back cover."
yes,yes,yes,I don't recommend this phone.
no,no,yes,"I got this product as an upgrade from S4 early this year, went to S5 Neo instead of S6 due to expandable memory...I have had this phoenix for less than a year and have had so many problems, but no solution given :( Ear piece heats up when talking over the phone through what's app or Skype, battery..."
yes,no,yes,was all good till the screen cracked in my pocket with the samsung view case closed.
yes,yes,yes,The phone has been good - the battery capacity is not impressive - my old moto G lasted just as long as this one - I still need to charge it every night... I love the quality of the pictures.
no,yes,no,After reading good reviews i purchased this phone but the experience is very different.It has been a week i bought this phone but its rubbish. It stops on its own and restarts. It is also very very slow. I wont recommend anyone.
yes,yes,yes,"the batter for me lasted 2 days sometimes! my phone was actually dropped off of a cliff onto a rock,then slid into salt water from the ocean, and survived"
yes,yes,yes,"Great value for money and looks brilliant in all colours, I have the silver. The only cons are shakes camera for some shots and could do with a little more RAM. Other than that, 5 stars!"
no,yes,yes,works good for viewing emails and documents. BIG DOWNFALL IS IT FREEZE UP WHEN YOU TURN IT ON ATKEAST ONCE A DAY! only thing I can do is pull the battery and turn it on again
yes,yes,yes,"I am disappointed because Samsung Galaxy S5 has more things than S5 neo has (finger print,screen mirroring,water and dust proof,IR led....). Please Samsung make an update on s5 neo and introduce screen mirroring. Thank you."
yes,yes,yes,So the new android 6 is out and the phone is compatible with it but if you go to do the update it isn't their to find and do.
no,yes,yes,From first use this appears to be an unpredictable battery chewing piece of rubbish. Hate it.
yes,yes,yes,I am extremely happy with this phone. Great pics. Good performance. Cool running. Battery life fair. Storage expansion is a great feature. It is light as compared to friends phones. Slim design is a nice feel too.
no,no,no,I have had nothing but trouble with this phone since I bought it 6 weeks ago to replace my S5 which was also faulty. Phone is very very slow and drains battery quickly
no,no,no,the manual shows you how to delete photo's from the gallery - when you try this action there is no rubbish bin or delete function as described in the manual and at present i'm unable to perform this function and reduce the amount of storage from unwanted photo's - surely they can't have got it wrong...
no,yes,no,On to second phone first was broken by my excavator as fell out of pocket and i had to dig it out and today fell out of my hand on site but only fell 3 ft and cracked screen. Used to have samsung gt c3350 which i still use for my alarm as you can turn phone off and turns itself on for alarm.
yes,yes,yes,THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S5 NEO IS SLIM ELEGANT AND PERFORMS TASKS EXCELLENTLY
no,yes,yes,If the phone worked at a faster speed it might be fine but also it sometimes does not unlock and does not allow you to.make phone calls without the screen going black and not letting you use the keypad
yes,no,yes,"Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo is also known as Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G903F Neo, It supports the latest Android OS, v5.1.1 (Lollipop), Supports Octa Exynos 7580 chipset, supports Octa-core 1.6 GHz Cortex-A53, Supports Mali-T720MP2 , this was announced in 2015, in August, and it was released in 2015, in..."
yes,yes,yes,"What I first got the Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo it was an excellent phone, much better than the S4. It was fast & worked extremely well with almost everything I did with it. That was until a firmware update was pushed & installed a few weeks ago."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a good design with fab features and a decent camera sadly the battery life lets it down. If you intend to use this as a Smart Phone, as it's intended for, then you will find yourself having to charge the battery like every 12 hours."
no,yes,no,"Not too picky with my phone and only need a decent battery. The battery for this phone is terrible. My battery last 9 hours at max. To make matters worst, it takes roughly 4-5 hours to go from 15% to 100%."
yes,yes,yes,"This ia a great phone apart prom the battery performance. My phone loses 35% overnight in the space of 4 hrs ... can't be relied on as an alarm. Shocking, and my phone is only 6 wks old running on power save mode, no bluetooth enabled, no location enabled."
yes,no,yes,Exellent camera quality and Exellent sound quality and very user friendly
yes,yes,yes,Happy with it in every way. Faster in day to day use then the original s5
yes,yes,yes,Very good phone and having great performance and counts pulses and stress. The only negative is that has not fingerprint.
yes,yes,yes,A very good phone! All in one! Good performance. Hi standards. Quality. Nice camera. Luxury design.
yes,yes,yes,Amazing product great display and love that it's water and dust resistant
yes,yes,yes,"i have just upgraded to the s5 neo from the s3 and its a good phone apart from it does not support wireless charging which is a big let down in my opinion, apart from that its a really good phone."
yes,no,yes,The features are really good and it has some really useful apps built in.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone not much difference from the S5 from reviews I've read online. I love this S5 Neo as I've upgraded from a S3 mini so I'm really enjoying this phone and still learning about it.  It's fast, shape, size and screen is perfect with loads of features and I've not even tried all them yet."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has all the best features of the S6 without the nonsense like a finger print scanner. Plus it has removable battery, plus it's waterproof, plus it's cheaper! Just check out the S6 and the S5 Neo tech specs side by side and make your own mind up."
yes,yes,yes,"No problems so far, graduated from s4 to s5 ...then this the Neo. The camera is faultless takes much better vivid pictures than the s4 or s5. It seems a lot smoother and less bloatware and much easier to disable pointless apps. It just feels far quicker and more stable."
yes,no,yes,"Upgraded to the S5 Neo, initially was looking at the S6, but on researching both, decided to go with the S5 Neo due to the expandable memory. My nice shiny new phone arrived and I downloaded lots of music on a 64gb sd card, the phone wouldn't recognize it, so put it into the phone, formatted and..."
yes,yes,yes,"After my first review I contacted Samsung Support. And confirmed a faulty device. So now after getting another S5 neo, I am really happy and no niggles. Thanks Samsung. 100% happy"
yes,yes,yes,Recently upgraded from iPhone  Wanted a Samsung due to the great feedback and expandable memory but this ruled out the S6  So I initially got a s5 which is excellent but it was just too slow!
yes,yes,yes,Well I am really impressed with this S5 neo. And a couple of niggles. Top features the camera is awesome. And the processor makes the phone run so much faster. And the best thing no over heating. As I had that on my old S5.  Loving the latest Android version 5.1.1 lots of extras and quirks.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone the wife love's it.
yes,no,yes,Not very good battery don't last long have to charge it up twice in the day
yes,yes,yes,Good buy and awesome handset
yes,yes,yes,I love my Galaxy 5!!
no,no,no,This phone arrived with a scratched back cover. The cover for the power lead was hanging loose and broke off when the lead was put in. There was no screen cover on the phone. The box had a new sticker over another sticker. This was sold as a new phone. It is highly unlikely that this phone is new.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent like-new product that's was better than expected since it was a low price. However, heartbeat sensor did not work and felt that I should have been informed about this. Great purchase for those on a budget but do expect there is probably a reason why it's cheap."
no,yes,no,"Phone looks brand new, but even though it is sim unlocked, it still carries the Korean LTE provider, aswell as the screen goes weird at times and the keyboard just types nonsense."
yes,yes,yes,excellent product . Phone like new. Son delighted
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic....works perfectly....delivered this afternoon ☺
yes,yes,yes,"This is a GREAT phone, even though it's 3 years old now. If you can't afford a new flagship then this is a great alternative. The specs are really good and if you can pick up a used one in good condition then it's a bargain! Not 5 stars as the build quality is not great."
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant Purchase well worth the money thank you so much
yes,yes,yes,An absolutely amazing deal for what I got !!
yes,yes,yes,It was a present but I believe the recipient finds it fine
yes,yes,yes,"Good sized phone,easy apps to access and handles well.lots of games and plenty storage"
yes,yes,yes,Great service. Only had it 4 days but seems fine. Excellent condition.
yes,no,yes,A few minor dents but apart from that the phone is working as if it's brand new! Very pleased and if I wreck this one I'd buy another from here ;)
yes,yes,yes,I brought it for my Mrs and she loves it. Excellent purchase.
yes,yes,yes,Great but for the money
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful phone with excellent features; so far working perfectly well
yes,yes,yes,I know this isn't the most up to date but I love this phone - mostly I use it to take photos rather than phone or text as the EE signal is rubbish in our area (contract with BT who said it was good coverage grr). I bought the S5 so I could also get the lens kit and I'm very pleased with it all.
no,yes,no,"The phone arrived early and in better condition than I expected, however the battery life is a lot shorter than I expected (possibly due to the battery being old) and the finger print scanner stopped working after 2 weeks of having the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Happy with the earlier than expected delivery. The phone is in excellent condition. My only problem is that the phone will not charge unless I take the back off,"
no,yes,no,Battery life was extremely poor. Returned and bought a Moto G5 plus instead.
no,no,no,"Poor camera and photo quality, updates LOADS every few days! Crashes a lot too!!"
yes,yes,yes,Very pleased with the service and the product
yes,yes,yes,Good but not as good as the S4 or even the S3
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. I love Samsung products and this phone model is a good buy
yes,yes,yes,"Was packaged very well with extra's, like glass screen cover, earplugs and other stuff, which wasn't expecting. A brilliant mobile phone, in perfect working order. Good condition. I would certainly purchase again. My son was very happy. Thank you"
yes,yes,yes,So far so good; still getting used to it but it does everything I want as a relatively low user.
yes,yes,yes,Item was second hand passed off as new. Very disapointing!!!
yes,yes,yes,I can finally text random people during the day and play angry birds at night
no,no,no,I dont think the phone was new so returned it. The touch screen ws faulty too.
yes,yes,yes,"A beautiful phone. I didn't need to contact seller for this product. Ignore my previous review in regard to this phone. I happened to buy two phones, this one for my son. He loves it. It was another smartphone I was thinking on when I did the first review."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone easy to use very good service pleased all round
yes,yes,yes,Excellent service and also the phone is exactly what I wanted. Previously owned a Samsung SII which was a great phone and I wanted something similar but with a better processor for powering the apps I have installed and this fitted the bill.
yes,yes,yes,I need to get used to it before I can write a review later
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with the phone, only one thing really that isn't an actual issue - the CSC-Code of the device is DBT and not BTU, hence why there were German apps installed onto the device."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is exactly what I wanted, the camera isn't top quality but not a worry if you aren't a true photographer, the frame rate can easily deal with almost all games and has a good size hard drive, able to contain many apps. This phone is great for recreational use and work."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone best purchase ever
no,no,no,Load of rubbish phone keeps freezing turning on then off
no,yes,no,Little disappointed as the phone was difficult to set to an O2 sim contacted seller who was quick to respond and told me although the phone is saying it's locked to verizon to ignore and continue with the set up.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I was in the market for a new phone after my Sony Z3 compact decided that the volume rocker should constantly turn all sound off - not great when trying to make phone calls!
no,no,yes,It's really hit and miss with this company. The phone looks fine but a number of features do not work. The fingerprint sensor does not work at all and the sensor is totally broken and this phone has never made a successful usb connection to Samsung Kies or Smart Switch which means if you ever want...
yes,yes,yes,"Came quick, looks new, set up perfectly with my sim card, chuffed thanks a mill"
yes,yes,yes,"I received the product on time but no user handbook -it appears to have no sim card - No instruction what-so-ever - can't get it up and running - from that piomt of few - very very disappointed - my previous phones were cheaper, butall had clear instruction ansd hand book - the phone look excellent..."
yes,yes,yes,"Its a good phone; nice interface, camera is good, feels nice to use. However the battery life is very short, doesn't last 9-5 with not that much use. Has also slowed down a lot since I got it and I've found myself waiting for it to open apps."
no,no,no,"I got the phone and the sound does not work, for it to work i have to keep restarting the phone and then it will work for a hour or so and then it stops working again."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone in fantastic condition and in perfect working order, came quickly too very pleased with this purchase, Thank You"
yes,yes,yes,"Really great phone, it is only an S5 but the S5 is only two years old. The phone is beautiful and very fast."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone seems good, works well, I just have some graphic bugs quite often, maybe the phone had factory little bugs, not really nice when using it, but it's not a big big deal, just a details. The phone is conform to description beside it"
yes,yes,yes,I'm happy with this.
no,yes,no,Does not work and did not take my wifes sim card it is locked
no,no,no,Didnt work and still waiting for refund!!!
yes,yes,yes,Love it .very happy ....
yes,yes,yes,yes i like it and very good serveces
yes,yes,yes,Arrived fast. Phone perfect. No problems.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone! I changed from Nexus 4 which I loved, scared of taking the non-Google route. So far I don't regret my choice. I miss the default Google apps but the phone compensate for this by being good. I like that it's waterproof, micro SD, heart rate monitor, IR remote and more."
no,no,no,A very bad purchase as it failed to work after two months.
yes,yes,yes,"I'd just had to send one back to a different supplier (screen didnt fit correctly) but I'm glad because this one is better! Pure white case, uk plug, faster charging power lead, a samsung keyboard which worked and immediate update to android 6 marshmallow (all of which the other S5 didn't have)."
no,no,no,Phone was American. Had American band width and a lot of American apps. My dad had to take it to O2 and have them juggle with it to make it work tho he still has problems with connecting to data. There is also a lot of interverence when he is making calls.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. Good Value for money
yes,yes,yes,This was a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it
yes,yes,yes,"This is the 6th mobile phone that i have owned - Actually to replace my S3 - I thought that the best phone that i've ever owned was the S3 but this is better. Rather than spend a lot of money on a contract, buy a previous model & get a sim only deal - You'll save a fortune."
yes,yes,yes,I have had this phone for over a year and it's still works perfectly!
yes,yes,yes,I have been using it for a few months without any problems.
yes,yes,yes,Perfect phone at great price. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,"I owned this phone for 2 years and it was unbelievably good. Throughout the whole 2 year period it never died below 1% battery, nor did it ever cut out randomly. Such a smooth running phone could not praise Samsung enough for their devices especially this one!"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone! Fantastic screen.
yes,yes,yes,"I've used countless smartphones and I have to say the Galaxy S5 has been the best I have ever used. The display is simply phenomenal, videos and pictures look extremely sharp and crystal clear. The quad-core Snapdragon processing chip means there is almost no lag or sluggish-performance."
yes,yes,yes,Looks good works well. Screen size is great but not a heavy phone. Get the Samsung flip case. Magic.
yes,yes,yes,As described and delivered ahead of schedule
yes,yes,yes,"Sorry for delay, but really happy with product"
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant phone its even unlocked and came 3 days after ordering it
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. Worth every penny.
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung S5. Everything about it is fantastic.
yes,yes,yes,Love my new phone came on time
yes,no,yes,"Easy set up, higher performance and many thing to choose from the menu to suit your personal style! Very handy & worth buy..x"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent thank you.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought for wife , she loves it and finds the battery lasts a lot longer than her old Samsung 3 and is faster"
yes,yes,yes,very pleased with this fits the s5 perfect
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I've ever had.
yes,yes,yes,"I got mine from 4Gadgets & it was described as Used - Very Good, in pristine condition, which it was - just missing the box. Phone was exactly as described, been using it now for a couple of months with no problems at all."
no,no,no,"This phone is has no warranty , seller said it does. I took it to samsung store and there are also hardware issues on the handset. Sending it back as it is not what u paid for"
yes,yes,yes,100% new phone. Trusted seller
no,yes,no,This phone makes me miss my samsung S4 mini which was stolen. The camera does not zoom. My downloaded candy crush stops working quite often. Making me loose my hard earned level.
no,no,no,The description stated that all damage was strictly done towards the cosmetics of the phone. However the screen of the phone stops working and the i have to take the battery out several times waiting for it to work again.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone features but battery life not as good as other reviews suggest. I does have a useful ultra power saving mode that turns off bluetooth closes all apps apart from phone, email and texts and goes into black and white mode. I find myself using this mode quite a bit to get me through the day."
no,yes,no,Delivery good but fones battery was dead!!! Wouldnt charge at all!Bought a new one but couldnt send txts! Now got a s7 from an ee store!!!!
no,no,no,not working camera had to give back the phone
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned the Samsung Galaxy S5 for around a year now and have been extremely happy with my choice. Really fast charging time and the battery life is very good, A definite improvement for Samsung. I love the camera functions and it produces excellent results with great clarity."
yes,yes,yes,i received the handset on time and as described
yes,yes,yes,"this is an excellent phone. i use so many of the features. it says it is life,s companion and it so is that.. the only problem i have had is, i have had to restart the phone to get the blue tooth working a couple of times."
yes,yes,yes,very good value and an excellent product
yes,yes,yes,Ive had the s3 so the s5 was fine just bits that had changed. Very happy with the phone. Only 3 stars as was not expecting as much damage as what there was. But with it in a case you wouldnt know it was second hand. Was late due to bank hols
yes,yes,yes,"great perfect working phone, very clean just like new. Thank you"
yes,yes,yes,"Great , not fitted it yet but looks good"
yes,yes,yes,"A superb mobile phone,very fast and response"
no,no,yes,"Unfortunately,description didn't say that this was a US version of the phone with lots of bloatware from Sprint."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent service and product just as described. Very happy!
no,no,yes,"The cell phone came without the data cable, it only brought the UK charger that plugs into the wall socket (but without the data cable the charger is useless) and it also came without the earbuds, so I can't listen to my music.."
no,yes,yes,Phone came on time. Only problem is I am having problem with the camera. The pictures I take are not clear. And also the phone screen keeps going off on me. Good phone but just a few problems.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product.
yes,yes,yes,Bought to replace an aging Galaxy s2 but i was not prepared to pay silly money for the very latest smartphone models which offer very little more than this one. The other deciding factor was that with this model you can change the battery yourself which virtually no latest models of any phone...
yes,yes,yes,It was bought as a present. My daughter loves it.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is good but charger is not chargingneed to buy another one
yes,yes,yes,Had the phone for over a month now & everything is working well. Updated to 6.0.1 Marshmallow through official Samsung . This model is European S5 SM-G900F. Boxed & came with charger & battery also cables plus earbuds all in sealed bags + Quick start Guide.
yes,yes,yes,I have got this as i did not like the iphone 5s this phone is amazing works fine driped and did not smashed very fast and good sceen size would buy this phone and not an iphone
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and the fact you can have an external sd card gives it advantage over newer models.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone - bought this as birthday gift for my wife. I have a iPhone 6s Plus, compared to that S5 is quite light to hold, and not unsightly bezel given that 6s plus is only 0.4 inches more, s5 screen is good."
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing, it arrived next day, a good phone as expected."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic I Bought Used But It Seems As Good As New Accept From The Average Tell Tale Sign's That It's Been Previously Used. But Everything Work's As Intended So Very Pleased.
no,no,yes,This came with a virus on the software
yes,yes,yes,"A couple of generations old, and it was my first smartphone, but I am very pleased with it. I love that you can increase its capacity by adding an SD Card. I bought a good leather case for it and fitted a glass screen cover so it should last me for some time."
no,no,no,Worst phone I've ever used do not buy.
yes,yes,yes,The product complies with the specifications. I recommend
no,no,no,"SIM-Free? Nope! Had for over a week and still not able to use, having an awful time getting it unlocked and set up and the thing came with no earphones, a 2 prong adaptor instead of a 3 so had to but one and literally just the original box wrapped in paper and was dented and battered."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, Even better than the newer models, it seems the newer these phones get the worse they get."
no,no,no,sent it back because charging was erratic - only charge if phone was switched off and sometimes wouldn't charge at all.
yes,yes,yes,Was very happy with purchase. The battery life is much better than on Galaxy Ace S2. I did have to order a new sim as it was smaller than old sim. I think the nano. The screen is good size and really clear. The camera is also really good. Overall very happy.
yes,yes,yes,"Have been using this phone for over a year now to replace Galaxy S3. All messages, contacts, and apps automatically transferred to the new phone through Smart Switch. Very fast phone. It upgraded to Android Lollipop when that software came out shortly after the phone release. Very good battery life."
yes,yes,yes,"Wouldn't bother looking at other types of smartphone. The galaxy range does far more than i'll ever use. If there is a weakness, then it would be that it has too many gimmicky options that i don't think are used by many people."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and much better battery life than my iPhone swapped for this. Some of the native apps are not great so you can swo these out for better ones from the app store. I choose this over the S6 as you can change the battery in this when it starts to loose its ability to hold charge.
no,yes,no,It was returned faulty.
yes,yes,yes,"Further to my original review in May 2015 (below), the phone became dysfunctional in January 2016. Still under guarantee so contacted the supplier. Very prompt response which included returns label, However, the returns address is Luxembourg!!!"
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful phone and it performs well. It has a nice feel to it - doesn't feel cheap in my opinion. Camera quality seems beautiful but I haven't used it that much or compared it to anything else so I haven't much to say with regards to that.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, just a shame that this isn't the UK version."
yes,yes,yes,"What a fantastic phone! I had an iPhone 5 previously, so It was a wild stab in the dark going for a phone that's relatively different. I am really pleased with it, as it handles the Internet brilliantly, and is nice to use and hold."
yes,yes,yes,Will not buy Apple again...EVER! This stuff is AWESOME
yes,yes,yes,"After having an iPhone, iPad AND a Macbook, i was a bit dubious about switching to an android!.......but to be honest.... A PHONES A phone. Although this has some great features, related to the air gestures and motion. it does pretty much everything you would want it to."
yes,yes,yes,Very very pleased with this purchase. It was a gift for my daughter and she is over the moon with excitement. I will definitely recommend this to others.
yes,yes,yes,The S5 is amazing and the price is a bargain! I'm really pleased with the phone so far!
no,no,yes,"Writing this review after using the phone for at least 4 months. I have used all the major os and recently tried lumia 1520 before buying GS5. After using lumia 1520 (camera screen broke after a fall from 2 ft height), I was initially disappointed with GS5 - camera quality, and battery appeared to..."
yes,no,yes,The finger print scanner is not great but it is a good smartphone. Compared to my S2 it is broadly the same but faster.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent, presents went done extremely well. An amazing phone, which lives up to expectations. I only wish I had purchased one for myself!"
yes,yes,yes,Everything is working fine. I have it for about 1 month now and i am happy with it.
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this S5 for 3 days. I purchased the phone reluctantly to be honest when my S3 succumbed to ""sudden death syndrome"" but I can honestly say I'm happy with the switch. it is a pretty awesome phone. I would recommend it to everyone who is looking for a new phone."
yes,yes,yes,great phone best I have had the company sent it with a European plug but just put the usb adapter into a univesal charger works great good battery life easy to use much preferred to my old I phone
no,yes,yes,"Besides the setting is in Chinese, the user manual dont do much help, the rest is working just fine"
yes,no,yes,I love it because my old mobile Samsung S2 is battery fast flat this why new is long time battery worth it
yes,yes,yes,"Had my S4 stolen so treated myself to the new model. Works really well, perhaps a tad on the large side, but being water resistant and can be QI enabled a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Some problems after purchasing the EU bundle from EE but very happy with the phone itself. Taking some time to get used to the enhancements in the latest Android there is so much to learn, but will get there."
yes,yes,yes,Got my phone one day later and it was in amazing condition just as advertised 10/10 thanks :)
yes,yes,yes,The dogs ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of smart phones - nothing else comes close!
yes,yes,yes,Good Service. Fits perfect
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone but not a significant improvement over the S4
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone and set it up to find that it had a faulty camera. I go a very unhelpful response as I wanted a phone but had to order it agin as was offered nothing for the hassle it cause. Would of been happy with a cheap case.
yes,no,yes,I thought this was a sim free phone when inserted a sim it ask for an unlocking pin ???
yes,yes,yes,Really fab phone at good price
yes,yes,yes,Good phone no issues.
yes,yes,yes,"Upgraded from S4 this phone is unbelievable fantastic,,, what more can I say go and buy one !"
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy is very easy to use. Did play is clear
yes,yes,yes,"Today I received my Samsung S5 and to be blunt, I hated the general interface. It's like Windows 8 of the mobile world. Samsung had changed things a lot, and not for the better. For example, the volume keys are mapped to take photos rather than the zoom controller of previous iteration."
yes,yes,yes,"best smartphone i have ever used, just the battery life alone would have been enough for me to buy this over the s4"
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone with a great battery life. Some of the features are amazing and you keep finding new things the phone can do! It has a good build, very light. I'd recommend buying a case for it as it does seem a bit flimsy. Other than that I see this lasting me for many years."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, excellent condition"
yes,yes,yes,Was really pleased to recieve this product. the only thing was that it was all in French including the instructions which is not what i expected.
yes,yes,yes,exactly described
yes,yes,yes,"S3 2 S5 Impressions I have been using an S3 for the last couple of years and upgraded to a S5. My impressions: 1. It’s bigger, but the screen is not wider and just a few mill longer. You can now get 20 icons on a screen rather than just 16. 2. People say it does not look as classy as an iphone."
yes,no,yes,The Galaxy S5 is a beautiful and bountiful smartphone. But not with without some niggles. Upgraded from the Iphone 5 and wasn't sure if I'd made the right decision but after I've played with it a few days I definitely have. Battery life is phenomenal.
no,yes,yes,I purchased this phone 4 months ago as a present for my grandson. It was only at the weekend I discovered it was in fact a SM-G900I Telstra branded phone. Had I noticed this at the time it would have been sent back.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. I am an android person through and through and find this easy an intuitive to use. The size makes it good for reading the screen and it takes great pictures.
no,yes,yes,"Dreadful phone. When trying to wake it up to unlock the screen, sometimes it just decides not to. You have to leave it for 10-20 seconds and try again. Keyboard is poorly calibrated and the predictive text can be infuriating, when compared to my last phone; Sony Xperia Z1 Compact, this is just utter..."
yes,yes,yes,"Pros All customer reports say the same, the battery life is second to none. speaker volume is loud enough this time. very easy to use and excellent menu. Cons Many of my apps didnt work and tomtom refused to accept the new phone so that was 55 pounds wasted."
no,no,yes,"It Does what it's designed to do, the phone works ok & the texting is ok My main reason for the purchase was to use the GPS facility to pass on to my camera co-ordinates for precise locations"
yes,yes,yes,Arrived next day and everything is as described. A very happy experience!
yes,yes,yes,It was excellent item thanks
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this S5 for my wife, and she loves it. Very easy to operate,lovely camera and good battery life."
yes,yes,yes,Does more than I need it to do. Much more reliable than my S4.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent. Delivery and phone.
yes,yes,yes,Got this from the Warehouse deal. Works perfect and came as described with a few scratches so there were no nasty surprises
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone and speedy service
no,yes,no,"The phone wasn't even water resistant. got a bit of rain on it and poof, broke. I suggest that no should buy the phone from these guys and just go to a Samsung store where you can get it repaired under the warranty."
yes,yes,yes,"A Great upgrade from S3 to S5. A Great Smartphone for £299 I use this phone for everyday tasks such as: Social Media Running apps from Android Studio, as an emulator. Listening to music Web browsing Reading the news Recording FULL HD Videos."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, in my opinion this is better than the later versions as it is water proof down to around 1 metre, takes a 128gb memory card to boost storage and you can change the battery in just a few seconds if you are not near an outlet when you need a recharge. Great performance at a great price."
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good, no real problems except earphones, nearest store is an hours drive 40 miles aprox, Samsung staff kindly gave me free headphone replacement with my proof of purchase, so more or less so far so good"
yes,yes,yes,A very nice phone which I am happy with.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone for a week now and do not regret this purchase. Phone works great, slight damage on the sides of the phone cover but that doesn't bother me at all. I would definitely recommend if you're looking for a low price but up to date android."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone.... but its rooted... Customer support from the supplier is also very good
yes,yes,yes,Its a good phone brad new. I would love to hive it five stars but i dont know why this phone gets warm too quickly and the back camera isn't clear.
yes,yes,yes,I've gone straight from the S3 as my contract term overshot the S4 and it's a massive difference in all the right ways so this is now my third Galaxy (first one I had being the first Galaxy they launched).
yes,yes,yes,I recommend this product
yes,yes,yes,Everything fine
yes,yes,yes,I love my S5. I still have it despite it being 2 years old now. Recently upgraded to Marshmallow and still does everything I need. Still very fast and a great camera. I have 32GB SD card in it and it stores everything I need.
yes,yes,yes,Great all round phone! But with smartphones get a tough cover as they are as fragile as glass! I also think there are better chinese made phones out there that do a better job and are cheaper. Such phones like Cubot etc.
yes,yes,yes,"Delivered as promised, is as described, great price"
yes,yes,yes,"No longer owned, upgraded to S7"
yes,yes,yes,excellent and good service
yes,yes,yes,exaclly as described spot on
no,no,no,"I have just received my order and found a mark which is white under the glass of the screen around the home button. It is visible in sunlight on all backgrounds. That is manufacturer defect, seems like a glue spot under the glass. The mark photo: imgur.com/yFy56Nb.jpg"
yes,yes,yes,"I bought mine as used, as new and it was practically brand new, so I'm more impressed by that. The phone itself, does the job better than my s4, bigger better screen, nicer options, faster, better battery life."
yes,yes,yes,"Mine came from Eastern Europe (in English) so I had to delete some of the pre installed bloatware but it works brilliantly here in the UK. It's a great phone, completely replaced most of my electronic devices for one sturdy unit."
yes,yes,yes,"This item was a gift but there has been no complaints so far, overall she is very happy with the phone"
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone! After only ever having an iPhone this was a big decision to change but so glad I did.
yes,yes,yes,I won't write a huge review as they can be found all over the Internet. But.. I have always ways like the Galaxy S range and this one does not disappoint. Amazing screen and lightning fast performance. As with all Samsung phones I have to admit they are full of bloatware but what can you do.
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone overall. I've had this a year now and I've had no issues with it. It sometimes switches off when in my pocket around once a month - I think this may be due to a loose battery connection - but hey, at least I save power!"
yes,yes,yes,It's just awesome. I'm more than happy. you should try it as well. you will not regret the call if you'll buy it.
no,yes,no,Worked fine for a few days then the screen went black and it wouldn't switch back on. Full refund issued quickly
yes,no,yes,"* Videos wont work - Unsupported audio/video codec (vids work on my GS1, Tab 2 10.1, Nexus 7, GS4 Mini, and GS3 no problems.) * Flash/light is as dim as hell - possible done deliberately as GS3 bright flash tends to wash the picture out. BUT!!! option to change intensity would have been nice."
no,yes,yes,The phone not dictating the SIM card
yes,no,yes,love it very good condition and happy with it
no,yes,no,"Do not buy this phone if you want 4G. This particular model of samsung s5 G900H doesn't support it. If you want the 4G support, but the G900F variant."
no,yes,yes,The handset I received was not a uk handset but a Hong Kong version.
no,no,no,The phone came after one month in its sealed case but has some damage on it meaning the lower right corner where the return button is Has unsticked and light is passing threw on the screen and if I press it down the return button doesn't work for a while.
no,no,yes,"The fist time I connected the charger to the phone to recharge the battery , everything was fine until few minutes later, the charger exploded. Fortunately the phone itself didn't suffer any damage."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm going to do some grumbling in this review, but before I do that, I have to first say that this is a fantastic phone. I came to the S5 from a Galaxy S2, Samsung's first iPhone killer, much underrated at the time, but such a good phone that only recently did I feel the need to upgrade."
yes,yes,yes,The gyro stops to work after few weeks. I returned this product. But the phone is amazing. I am looking forward to buy another one and hope that works well
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely love my phone, haven't had it that long still learning the basics with it, but I highly recommend it if your not waiting for the S6 to come out, I wanted a phone that will last me a couple of years and hopefully this phone will do the job, was a bit worried about the shipping of the phone..."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone I've ever had. I previously owned an iPhone 5S but wanted a bigger screen. The main reason for buying this phone was for the camera. The camera for me is simply amazing, its really quick and the photo quality is excellent."
yes,no,yes,"upgrading from a Galaxy S4 I decided to go for the S5 rather than the S6 as you are able to insert a micro sd card into the S5 but not the S6 and you are also able to change the battery in the S5 should there be a problem with it, but not the S6."
yes,yes,yes,"Very pleased with this phone. Fast, many apps, airmode preview is really cool. I'm a IPhone lover, but I love this Samsung even more. Mac stays on top though."
yes,no,yes,"I ordered the 4G model as described here (Item model number: SM-G900FZKABTU) where is gives a product description saying: ""Samsung GALAXY S5 Android Phone GSM UMTS 4G 16 GB 51 Full HD Super AMOLED charcoal black SMG900FZKABTU"". I could not get 4G to work."
no,yes,yes,does not have 4g samsung say its made for india and will not cover warranty if anything goes wrong what a rip off
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, we have used it with Three UK and it downloaded all the correct settings and worked out of the box."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone arrived really fast and in perfect conditions. As described, it supports 4G and it's unlocked. I've been using this phone for one month and I haven't had any problems with it. I'm really satisfied with this purchase."
no,yes,no,Smooth and works flawlessly Had LG G3 and was disappointed by how slow the screen user experience was. Laggy and slow. Gone back 2 S5 and works like a dream. G3 screen size is better than S5 because G3 utilises area space very well and can fit alot more widgets much better than S5.
yes,yes,yes,"I Have Had This S5 Since August 2014 And Had NO Problems Yet, Very Good Mobile Some of The Apps On It I Don't Use But Hey Doesn't Matter To Me Really. It's Very Quick in Processing info and Great For Storing Photo's and Vids For a Temporary Time."
no,no,no,Phone was locked to another country and NOT UK stock.
no,no,no,Received with broken security seals and immediately returned
yes,yes,yes,I purchase this phone thinking the larger screen size and updated features would be of help to me being partially sighted. I find the magnification gestures feature pointless at best and the talk back gets confused on the most simple of words.
yes,yes,yes,"I wasn't sure whether to bother with the s5 as I loved my s4 and it didn't seem like a leap forward and to be honest it's not, there are improvements, screen and battery are much better and few tweaks I like but some minor changes I liked better on s4 (black menu, messaging and menu layout where..."
yes,yes,yes,"I have found this smartphone very good so far, certainly worth 4 stars but as I have only had it for two weeks I am unable to give a full 5 star rating as yet, though |I feel confident it will warrant this in the end."
yes,yes,yes,I never write reviews but as I have just purchased this phone I felt I had to. Firstly I want to give my opinion of the Samsung Galaxy S5s biggest problem with others; the finger scanner. It was one of the first feature I tried and I have to say I've had no problems!
yes,yes,yes,Had this phone for about a month now after spending a long time deliberating as to whether to buy (previous phone HTC one HD) in the main because of potential problems with it not being compatable with the UK networks rasied by other reviewers.
yes,yes,yes,"Brilliant phone. Battery life has been between 2 and 3 days on average use. Amazing! the heart rate monitor works 50% of the time but its a nice gimic. Phone has never frozen or been slow, camera is much better than my S2. Much better value than an iphone and the screen is so clear."
no,yes,no,I bought this phone in September 2014. It has now developed a fault and should have been covered by the Samsung return to manufacturer warranty. Upon checking the IMEI Samsung reported that it is a non EU model and is therefore not covered by their warranty.
yes,yes,yes,"Brilliant phone, especially with the wireless charging back. This removes the need to charge via usb thereby not risking the woeful cover over the usb charging port (I would definitely remove one star if it weren't for the wireless charging option)."
yes,yes,yes,"Short review, Fantastic phone. Get it now before the Galaxy s6 comes out! Long review, I'm a long time fan of the Galaxy mobile phones. I've had all of them, bar the s4. I didn't get the s4 as I decided to get the HTC one m8 but I couldn't get on with it."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone replaced my s3 and with the regular updates, in my opinion gorgeous looks and the fantastic way this phone operates, I'm glad that I didn't go for a HTC or iPhone. With samsung you really feel the phone is yours to use and personalize as you wish. LOVE THE GALAXY RANGE."
yes,no,yes,"Ignore the people saying the phone does not work on anew EU netword, it came the next day after ordering and was able to start using it straight away. This phone is so much better than any iPhone, admitingly it takes a few hours to get used to the Android operating system but once you've worked it..."
yes,yes,yes,"Let's start with the reason this isn't a five star phone. In one word it's ""Samsung"", possibly with a bit of Google, but mostly Samsung. So you can't turn of the irritating shutter sound again. If you add a VPN connection it disables the fingerprint scanner."
no,no,yes,"I’ve had the S5 for just a few days now so these are my first impressions. It is the European variant, G900F. Samsung have not released an open UK specific model. On first boot the user selects the language from a dropdown list."
no,no,yes,The withdrawal of an FM radio tuner capability was very disappointing. This is something I do occasionally use to listen to BBC Radio 4 while out and about. I have added a Kiwibird extended battery pack to increase battery capacity to a sensible (>1 day) level.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone screen is nice and clear, and the phone reception is amazing and clear. But there are problems with the touch screen, its not lags, battery life is not that long when you use wifi hotspot. Also you need to stop background downloads from samsung on your phone."
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S5 is a real stunner. But not with out a niggle. well i like the phone everything about it is a upgrade from the S4. So far its all good i have to say. The camera is perfect, some websites have said its too slow to get in to camera mode. wow 2.5 seconds that's years!!."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone .Very fast , beautiful display,camera is amazing and finger print reader works all the time with me no issues.Only downside is the loud speaker not as loud as the one on s4.overall excellent phone well done samsung."
yes,yes,yes,Im really pleased to upgrade my HTC to Galaxy s5. Its just brilliant!! I cant find any faculty or negetive things.
yes,yes,yes,s4 to s5 - lots of small improvements and no bad ones. I had been worried about the usb cover but its no problem - no the best design feature but it contributes to the water resistant feature. overall really pleased.
yes,yes,yes,"I ""upgraded"" from my Samsung Galaxy S3 without checking whether the S5 phone had a built in radio (O.K., my mistake). It doesn't!! I spend a lot of time travelling by train where the internet is rarely available, so used the FM radio in my S3 to keep up with the news and listen to the new music..."
no,yes,no,I bought this phone as I upgraded from s3 I will write the cons first : - back flash led is weaker then s3 one - is not a big issue but stil it is PHONE ISSUE - back camera is not as wide as s3 one is PHONE ISSUE - on Skype cannot be sent video messages as the message appear like is coded only some...
yes,yes,no,Coming from Apple (and have bee pro-apple for 4 years) I thought it was time for a change. I was fed up of having to charge my phone 2-3 times a day and just generally the phone didn't do as much as I would have liked.
yes,yes,yes,"Upgraded from a Galaxy S3 to the S5 model. The difference is amazing, faster processor, more memory and phenomenal screen clarity. I use AllShare to send music and video to my surround sound over WiFi as well."
no,yes,no,Whilst I do like this phone I have only had it for 11 days and on the 8th day the little plastic retainer for the cover of the USB port broke. This means that I cannot cover the USB ports. This happened after only opening the port 8 times to charge up the phone.
yes,no,yes,This phone is amazing. Performance is excellent and it is packed with features. The finger print scanner is a little sensitive to stroke direction but if anything I consider that a good thing as it is obvious erring on the side of security!
yes,no,no,Upgraded from S4 and wasn't sure if I'd made the right decision but after I've played with it a few days I definately have. Battery life is phenomenal. I returned from work after a 9 hour shift with 92%battery. I didn't use it much but massive improvement over s4.
yes,yes,yes,"Received today and been playing with it all day ,music player is louder and has better sound quality than previous models and the camera is just fantastic as I took some photos and compared them with my wife,s iPhone 5s which has also great camera but I believe galaxy s5 pictures are bit sharper and..."
no,yes,no,Seems to work fine although the seal on the phone box was broken on arrival so I suspect someone had previously returned it.
yes,yes,yes,"great phone still works without problems and delays when you first turn on the updated to the fifth version of the android, Sim card Lebara adopted without problems, all happy"
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung S5. Will keep this for another 2 years. Has all the features I want.
yes,no,yes,The phone is great. My only criticism is the fact it came loaded with Vodaphone aps when it is supposed to be a SIM free phone. Some aps will not delete. Why not be honest and say the phone was for the Vodadphone market and been made SIM free but may still retain some aps
yes,yes,yes,Very good mobile phone. Brought it for my daughter birthday. She was very happy with her gift. Thank-u
yes,yes,yes,"I love this. Moving from iphone 5 after having every iphone since they launched - not bothering with Samsung S6 - two of my children have S5's - you can change the battery, put in an SD card ND it's waterproof - TomTom on it is ACE at £34 for 3 years ignore any negative reviews this is the nuts -..."
yes,yes,yes,"Product came exactly as described. Completely flawless, very satisfied customer, would definitely recommend."
no,no,no,"As a phone it's mostly ok but there are a number of very annoying things. 1) Sometimes I can't receive incoming calls when I'm on wifi - they just go straight to voicemail, which is extremely irritating 2) The charger cover has now broken twice, despite me being very careful with it - certainly not..."
yes,yes,yes,Bought as a present she was really pleased awesome.!
yes,yes,yes,very pleased with my phone .
yes,yes,no,"Great phone, although the charger stopped working the day it got delivered"
yes,yes,yes,great phone good price
yes,yes,yes,Amazing product and service. Dealt with any issues I had
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a great device. First time I've owned a Samsung and love it already. Smart features and cool tricks are amazing on this phone. In terms of screen size and quality it's perfect, nice size for texting and operating with one hand."
yes,yes,yes,"So nice i am so hally with that, there is no problems.."
yes,yes,yes,Very pleased with my phone
no,yes,yes,Phone works OK and has all that i want from a phone.

yes,yes,no,This phone was not genuine samsung and was returned.
yes,yes,yes,does what i expected it to do
yes,no,yes,"Both my Samsung Galaxy s1 and s3 felt new, innovative and distinct improvements over the previous phone I had owned. This is not the case with the s5, which feels bland, unimaginative, sometimes even glitchy and distinctly underwhelming."
yes,yes,yes,It is very good according to my expectations.
yes,yes,yes,I love love this phone!. Coming from an iPhone this was a breath of fresh air. The iPhone would crash and shut apps that I was using which was so frustrating but the samsung galaxy s5 works perfectly apps run perfectly.
no,yes,no,phone is great although the charger that was sent with it was faulty and would not charge it properly.
no,no,yes,"This phone is awful, the vibration.is so weak and the battery runs out too fast!!! Also not waterproof!!! Sort it samsung!!!"
yes,yes,yes,Truly the best phone I have ever had in my life! It may not appear a huge upgrade from the S4 as of such but many of the features have improved. Battery life is excellent!. It give's me a good 3 days worth of use from a single charge. The sound quality is slightly better too.
yes,yes,yes,Its early days but its looking good.
no,no,no,"good when bought it, but phone stop working after few months :( need buy new one"
yes,yes,yes,my husband has good taste in phones very pleased with this Galaxy S5
yes,yes,yes,Excellent ...just as described..no problems
yes,no,yes,"Due to a small mistake, the phone was not as advertised, but Music Magpie refunded the full amount immediately and without quibble. I'm very satisfied. Mark"
yes,yes,yes,"galaxy S5 had now around 6 months i bought an extreme case for it, i always do. my job in the building industry means it is a must the phone has performed as well as i expected it to if not better. i would recommend this phone."
yes,yes,yes,My wife loves this phone. Much prefers it to our daughters i6.
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with my Galaxy S5, it was a very good price I dont know why, but I dont have any complaint."
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with it and the dispatch time good.
yes,yes,yes,"This has to be my favourite phone, I am still using it towards the end of 2016."
no,yes,yes,The phone is OKAY (S5-900F) but would the phone I ordered (S5-900H) been any better spec wise.
yes,yes,yes,The phone ticks all the boxes but i believe they could have in the description that its not 4g compatable
yes,yes,yes,I love my new galaxy s5 phone the only thing that It is missing is a radio otherwise I could not be happier with it
yes,yes,yes,New to the world of smartphones. So far the product would seem to be solidly made and the graphics are excellent.
no,no,no,In description it said it had no scratch on screen and it did. Only 1. Also has crashed on me a couple a times
yes,yes,yes,This is my first smart phone and was easy to learn how to use it. Takes excellent photos.
no,no,yes,This phone came with Hong Kong firmware and was also rooted. I therefore sent it back.
yes,yes,yes,LOve all Galaxy S series this is a great phone
yes,yes,yes,This is the 1st Android I've owned since a very poor acer budget phone I bought several years ago (since then I've been an Apple fanboy). The phone is very fast and responsive.
yes,yes,yes,"very pleased with the phone I bought, in fact I was so pleased i ordered a second phone for my son, the phone was described as like new and it really was as good as new!"
yes,yes,yes,Advertised as new and arrives second hand
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant little phone was concerned as it was recondioned but no problems so far.will be buying a gain in the near future
yes,yes,yes,Best samsung galaxy. The last one which has storage expansion and battery replacement.
no,no,yes,"I've bought this phone the 24 of July 2015.... Now someone stole it, is it possible to supply with IME number that I can blocked it.."
yes,yes,yes,So far so good... I'm not really good with technology but in this case I can say that even though it works fine sometimes gets stuck in an app such as Facebook and shut itself down. And is a bit slow.
yes,yes,yes,brilliant product just what i wanted
yes,yes,yes,Everything that the S3 should have been.
yes,yes,yes,As phone it's fine. Some of the functionality could be better but that's probably true of all phones. Screen clarity is good and can look at web pages and videos comfortably. Battery life fair.
yes,yes,yes,Just Great Love it thanks
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect. As advertised and shipped and packed well. In fact, product was better than expected. Thanks very much. Problem report has now been sent to seller."
yes,yes,yes,". There are a number of good reviews here and I do not want to rehash what has, necessarily been said before, so here is “my 2 pence worth”. Samsung's Galaxy S5 excels at everything that seems to matter - Android 4.4 KitKat OS; a bright, good display; and powerful quad-core processor."
no,no,yes,"I'd formerly bought a Wileyfox storm but got so tired of the rubbish battery life and the occasional freeze that enough is enough. Nothing beats a branded phone, with Removable battery and other accessories. So forked or for this beauty and am not disappointed! In went a make micro sd card."
no,yes,no,After owning this for several months it's still almost all I'd want in a phone. The screen is fabulous. I decided to encrypt mine for added security. Not sure it was a good idea as it now has a log in screen at boot up and then does a second boot after the password. Also it seems more sluggish.
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 is better than the S6 in my, and others, opinions. The S6 has gone down the Apple way with a battery you can't change, and it does not last as long, and you can't add more memory, what is Samsung doing!!"
no,no,no,Terrible it said sim free then when it came it was locked to vodafone
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has one of the best cameras, plus you never have to worry about it getting wet. It is 200% waterproof: I have gone to the pool with it and nothing happens. But probably the best feature is the heartbeat monitor, it's really accurate and addictive."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, so quick, amazing display and camera! Worth every penny so far"
no,no,no,advertised as network free..but was with network O2 had to pay £15 to have unlocked :(
yes,yes,yes,Given to me as a work phone from my company its a great phone not outdated yet and has a great camera removable back so battery can be removed and expandable micro SD card slot
no,no,no,Phone don't work its root
yes,no,yes,"The only draw back for me was that my sim does not fit and I have had to order a new micro one. The phone is otherwise lovely, I love Samsung and only use their phones. I wish they would put the sim on the outside like the Sony Xperia does, but not to worry, once its in place it should work ok,..."
yes,yes,yes,Luv it no problems at all
yes,yes,yes,Love my new phone great if you like Samsung Galaxy phones :-)
yes,no,yes,A major improvement is the ability to put the phone into ultra power saving mode which extends the stand you time up 12.5 days but with a limited number of facilities. The access to SETTINGS is now very much easier. I particularly like the finger print reader as a security measure.
yes,yes,yes,Didn't need to worry about it being set up in a different language. This phone is kosher...and does exactly what was said on features etc...I was very worried about purchasing such an expensive item online...but did as the phone shop was 70 pound dearer.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone it's so fast simple to understand are at apps fantastic value takes great pictures I can't say anything bad about this phone
yes,yes,yes,"I was tired of having cheap phones, so I decided to make the big step towards a smart phone. It's really awesome, I can't stop glycogen it. It is faster than my laptop!"
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I use it a lot when cooking something in the microwave that needs a timer. It is so easy to use SVoice by pressing the Home button twice and saying start timer for 15 minutes. Sending text message is also easy using SVoice just say text (someones name) and the message.
yes,yes,yes,Came quickly and phone was in almost pristine condition apart from a few small dents in corners but with a case on completely unused noticeable and screen is perfect
yes,yes,yes,Delivered as per time schedule - The phone and packaging was perfect. The phone s5 itself is an amazing piece of art ! This is my move from Apple iphone - Love Galaxy s5 !
yes,yes,yes,Great device. Delighted I bought it outright rather embark on another extortionate contract with one of the mobile companies. Bit of an initial outlay but will break even at 18 months
yes,yes,no,"The phone itself is excellent, though the USB flap can be a bit awkward if you have a case on. However, I had to send mine back for a full refund because I was sent a phone with Hong Kong baseband firmware (G900FZHUANI2). I have read that this may mean it doesn't have a valid UK warranty."
yes,yes,yes,Been with apple for many years But thought I would give samsung a try so bought the s5 for myself and my wife and we both love the phones the apps are great and the speed of the s5 in 10 out of 10 a great all round phone we will not be going back to apple we have lots more freedom with the s5
yes,yes,yes,I had a iphone 4s from 2011/2012 until 2015 and to be fair it still met my needs to a point as my phone was just used for the odd text but mostly it was used for music so in 2015 16gb is just not enough it was time for the dreaded upgrade. I decided on the s5 for the following reasons.
yes,yes,yes,"This IS the European version... Here’s the list of model numbers of the SM-G900, or the Galaxy S5: - SM-G9006V_CHN_CHN (China) - SM-G9008V_CHN_ZM (China) - SM-G9009D_CHN_CTC (China) - SM-G900A_NA_ATT (AT&T) - SM-G900D_JPN_DCM (Japan) - SM-G900F_EUR_XX (Open Europe) - SM-G900H_EUR_XX (Open Europe) -..."
yes,no,yes,"Can't complain of the price, but some mixed feelings of the product. Firstly, it's a blisteringly fast phone, with a beautiful screen, at about half the price of an iPhone, and no doubt the upcoming Galaxy 6. So, why is the price so good?"
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded this phone from galaxy sIII. I still love my galaxy sIII so much. I believe it is still better for me. GS5 is a Nice product but I didn't get what I expected:- -First of all the battery life is better than any smartphones but still it has got Ultra Power saving mode.
no,no,yes,"I have had this phone since October. Had no problems with it at all. Apart from the charger cover came off within the first week, but i genuinely believe that this was through my heavy handedness. Also its not unlocked and is advertised as unlocked."
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone 6 months and what can I say its the best there is nothing I can fault. The phone is smooth and has tons of memory for apps and what are the highest quality photos I've seen.
yes,yes,yes,i went from and iphone 4 to this and I'm so happy with this purchase i would not go back to iphones again. Only thing is have to wait few days after you order i just wish it came sooner as i was eager to get it.
yes,no,yes,"Upgrading from a Galaxy S3, the S5 is even easier to set up. The screen is a delight. If the comments about the plastic back worries you, then put it in a case - I would anyway, for protection."
yes,no,yes,Simply stunning. There were no issues at all with this. Much better to buy som free up front than a contract. It seems stupid to buy them on contact when all they do is give yo a loan.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone but the battery could be better. Although I have it on power save mode all the time I have to charge it twice a day. Other than that it's fast, the camera is great and it works well."
yes,yes,yes,"Fab! I changed my old Blackberry Torch for the Galaxy and thought this screen would be too big for me, but two weeks on and I'm loving it! It has fantastic image and sound quality. For someone who enjoys taking pictures and making videos, this phone is a must! Very happy with it!"
yes,no,yes,I had to replace my S3 because I had a black-screen problem. If you are into the gadgets then go for it. The only thing is that the camera seems to be worse than the one in S3... It doesn't focus that well and pics are not as sharp as those I have made with my old galaxy S3
yes,yes,yes,Great phone much better than iPhone. Easy to use and lots of great features. Only down side is the battery life if your own the phone mist of the day does drain quickly. However the charger that comes with the phone is super fast. Definitely a great purchase.
yes,yes,yes,"It is a great mobile! Many functions, quick, and an aazing camera! It works well in Europe, I hope so when I go back to Brazil, it will still work well. There was a quite delay to send informations about the delivery of my order, but when i sent a e-mail requesting it, they answered me quickly."
yes,yes,yes,I have had mine for a short while new on a contract after i sent back a Moto G 2nd Gen after it went wrong. All i can say is the Galaxy S5 has been faultless! Never glitched or needed rebooting.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent service. Phone is the 'f' model so it works perfectly in the UK, I'm sat in my house in South Devon right now using it. I ordered this on Sunday and it was here at lunch on Tuesday, the guys even sellotaped a sweet in the box for me. Update."
yes,no,yes,"Very happy with the phone. It came special delivery, firmly packed and 2 days early. I was a little disappointed with the phone not coming with headphones. The phone did not have a smudge, scratch or mark and it was also unlocked. The phone itself is fantastic."
no,no,no,"Phone stopped working within 2weeks and had to be returned. Kept freezing then would suddenly shut down, sometimes went on again others was shut down for hours"
yes,yes,yes,"Ordered uk but got eu version. Works ok but dont know how to change apps local phone book etc. comes up foreign, need to change to uk local. otherwise phone good ."
yes,yes,yes,I have been using it for a month now and all I can say is that I am so very happy! Best phone I had so far. Much better than Iphones. Screen it's amazing. Love it!
yes,yes,yes,The phone is very good (much faster than my previous version!) and the company I bought it from dealt with my inquiries quickly and professionally. Very pleased.
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded mine s3 to this beauty and I am almost thrilled to bits. I will list pros and several cons accordingly to my personal needs and taste. Pros + (Look) maybe it is nothing outstanding or astonishing, but it is SIMPLE nad ELEGANT without gilding the lily!"
yes,yes,yes,Perfect!!! I love this mobile :)
yes,yes,yes,Great smartphone! has got all the features I was looking for.
no,yes,yes,"Good phone, freezes a lot after a while though"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone not much you can't do with it. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,Totally happy with purchase process and phone is fab
yes,yes,yes,ITEM WAS NOT IN BOX. GOT EVERYTHING BUT PHONE. NOT HAPPY.
yes,yes,yes,excellent service and product.
yes,no,yes,The waterproof cover has fallen off!!
yes,yes,yes,You get exactly what you pay for. No complaints
yes,yes,yes,"Lovely phone, very easy to use"
yes,yes,yes,"As someone who has flitted between phones for several years, and previously used an iPhone the most, I feel that I've finally found a handset I can settle with now. So the size of the S5 is perfect, at least for me."
no,yes,yes,It came on time and fit the description.
yes,yes,yes,The phone was far cheaper than in stores (with around £150) i was a bit suspicious and worried after reading some reviews on other websites about phones that were meant to land in different continents than Europe.
no,yes,no,if you don't live in EU take care its not Sim free you will need to have an EU Sim card to can unlock the phone
yes,yes,yes,No issues home or abroad :)
yes,yes,yes,this is a fantastic phone and all the galaxy range are great but the 5 is the top one
yes,yes,yes,Great phone as expected
yes,yes,yes,Got mobile early than i was expected...thanks for that..
yes,yes,yes,"It’s a good phone but, I bought it about 4 days ago it came with south Korean Language as a default language and it was quite a challenge to change the Language into English, went on to utube to see if any info into changing the language but I couldn’t find anything on changing Korean language into..."
yes,yes,yes,Very good product. Recommended A+++
yes,yes,yes,Really Nice! Live description. Better than IPhone 5C
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone just a shame it takes a while to arrive
yes,yes,yes,Super phone good price
no,yes,no,did not come with the accessories that the description said would be included no charger usb cable headphones or instruction manual
yes,no,yes,A fantastic machine and I am wowed bu the camera
yes,yes,yes,An inexpensive but quality and reliable phone.
yes,yes,yes,Good phone for those not looking for the most up to date gadgetry (2017 now and this is a few phone generations old). Does all the necessary smartphone stuff and not too complicated to work.
no,no,yes,"bought phone, says it come with headphones and USB lead etc, my phone i paid for came in an envelope nothing else but the phone, no accessories at all"
yes,yes,yes,"Hmmm, where to begin?! It's a beautiful looking handset but that's where the luuuurrrve finishes for me I'm afraid and I will explain why. 1. Constantly dropping Wi-Fi signal despite other devices working fine in my house."
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone. Great lay out and easy to use. Good picture quality and sound. Water proff/resistant too!! I like the added extra of the cover for the charging point to stop dirt and water going in.
yes,yes,yes,I bought two if these phones. Strangely they came in different packaging and had different problems with setup and configuration on each. I wonder if these were international versions being passed on to the UK market? I've of them was pre-set in the Chinese language set..
yes,yes,yes,In the time I have had this phone I have never had any issues with it. I have just ordered a second one for a familly memeber who was need a new [sim free] phone and a friend is thinking about getting one as well due to my opinions of it. Great phone. Worhty of the 5 stars ErnieK
yes,yes,yes,"Full off stuff you can't remove and you don't need. Since I replaced the cover with a fold over one with wireless recharging I'm constantly seeing the ""check your cover"" message repeatedly. Not once a day, but every 30 seconds!?!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone so glad i puchase this item exactly over the moon, it came so quick in the post . I would recommed this phone. A GREAT DEAL TOO."
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone. Best smartphone out yet. It's water resistant, durable and light in the hand which doesn't compromise quality or versatility. The camera is fantastic...crisp and clear snaps in an instant, and there are dozens of photo effects to play with."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone I didn't think any one was better than iPhone after owning 3/3g/4/5s this Samsung s5? Let me put it this way I doubt I would ever buy a iPhone again
yes,yes,yes,Very impressed with this phone. Fast and responsive. Excellent camera. Beautiful OLED screen. Removeable battery and SD card (unlike the S6). And now very good value for money. Wish I hadn't put up with my laggy over heating battery munching Sony for a whole year.
yes,yes,yes,A great phone at a mid price point
no,no,no,Basically the phone arrived and it just didn't turn on nor did it want to take any charge. No sign of life at all. Tried every trick possible to get this phone to work without success. I am in process of sending it back and will keep this post updated with progress.
yes,yes,yes,"I had the Galaxy S3 and moved to Galaxy S4, I was contemplating whether I should upgrade my S4 to an S5 and I eventually did. So glad I did that because the performance of this phone is so much better and the screen quality and colour is definitely enhanced."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone. Not much bloatware #, most of which is useful. Battery life seems ok for a day at a time and the Ultra Power Setting is amazing. Custs down the phone to greyscale screen, calls and text only but means you still have access even when the phone is at 5% battery life."
yes,yes,yes,"Very clear big display. Battery lasts about 2 days which beats my daughters iPhone hands down.it charges up in approximately an hour and I believe that an extended life battery is available if required. The deal clincher for me was the replaceable battery, so it is feasible to carry a spare."
yes,no,yes,"Superb quality item from Samsung. I skipped the S4 so can't comment on a comparison between those two models, but using the S5 after the S3 is a delight, it really is that good."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great. It took some time to decide whether to purchase the S% , the Alpha or i6. The features on the S5 swung it plus the splash proofness . Very satidfied."
yes,yes,yes,phone came early and it's a really excellent phone. love it
yes,yes,yes,No problems so far. Fast & great screen to boot. Go buy one
no,no,yes,"Wrong model sent, this was not an EU model and is not compatible in this country."
no,no,no,"Buyer beware. Phone came from Hong Kong and was obviously had a Chinese operating programme. Once sorted, the phone is okay. Battery life is poor."
yes,yes,yes,Happy with this phone. Wasn't unlocked as stated but selling quickly dealt with it & sorted us out. Cheers happy buyer.
yes,no,yes,Loving it!! Why doesn't it come with inductive charging as standard????
yes,yes,yes,Wonderful to have such a big screen - just getting used to all features.

yes,yes,yes,I've been using this phone for a week now. Does everything brilliantly. My last phone (Samsung S2) failed after is got wet. The S5 is sold as being water proof. I do not intent to test it!
no,yes,yes,I'm no technophile and other people have posted some great reviews on this but I wouldn't buy it again. The battery life is AWFUL! It barely lasts 24 hours. A bit better if you turn of mobile data and wifi but even so...
yes,yes,yes,Wonderful best phone I have bought I've had about 20! Mobiles
yes,yes,yes,"There's a bit of delay with the delivery but the phone is worth waiting for ,very good phone , it is what it says in the description."

yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with my mobile,excellent quality,simple to use and good battery life which is brilliant. Cheers!"
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone. Slight damage, it was declared, so no surprises there. Seller shipped prompt and answered my query very quickly. This phone is so much better than the Apple, Samsung have nailed. See the camera Apps, just amazing."
yes,yes,yes,It is not exactly new. The box was open and was with carrier.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from S3 to S5 and received mine on Monday. I have tested most if its features since than and it is definitely a Great upgrade. The Phone is super fast and Samsung Gifts has great apps for Free to go with it The Fingerprint scanner works like a charm and havent failed me even once.
yes,yes,yes,"Dear Samsung, replacing hardware menu button functionality with app tasker which regular users do not use much is great FAIL. Yes, I'm aware that long press of menu button will does the trick. But this takes time and is contrary to any usability guideline."
no,yes,no,"I loved the phone when it arrived and I had really been looking forward to receiving it, having preordered it. However, when I was just a short way into the registration process I got an error message ""Samsung Link has stopped working""."
yes,yes,yes,"The screen is big and beautiful: videos and photos look amazing on it. The speaker is good, I just wish the speakers were on the front and they were stereo. Sound quality from headphones is excellent though. The camera is fantastic!"
yes,yes,yes,So far mobile is going perfect I would recommend it first class.

yes,yes,yes,Good value without surprising features.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, everything works well."
yes,yes,yes,"Love it, it's more powerful than my laptop! Really good quality for not so much money."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a preliminary review, 1 day in from receipt. I ordered this as a warehouse deal. Described at ""repackaged"". It arrived in an original S5 box, all accessories in place, all protection film in place, and not a blemish on it. A great deal to save £40!"
yes,yes,yes,This handset offers everything you could possibly need. Easy to navigate .
yes,yes,yes,It came as locked when it was advertised as sim free with great difficulty I got it done it took me two weeks and have to spend about £45 pounds.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent item!! Super Value.
no,no,yes,It's faster than the previous phone I had (also Samsung). But the fingerprint scanner is rubbish and not very good at recognising. Had it a while now and it's starting to slow down a bit and freeze every now and again...but only since the update a few months ago.
yes,yes,yes,"I like this phone but it took me a while to sort it out so the battery didn't drain as fast as it was. I bought a new battery for it which made it a bit better. The phone seems fast and responsive, I like the sound which comes from the speaker and the camera takes clear pictures which are all a big..."
no,no,yes,I've had very little experience with this phone as the charger or battery won't charge. Odd for a new phone to not work on the second day.
yes,no,yes,delivered as advertised
yes,yes,no,"Took to long to ship after it was ready to ship. According to the tracking number the phones were ready on the 5th, but they didn't ship till the 12th. Bad business."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, works just fine. Trouble with Samsung, though, trying to upload contacts from old Samsung Infuse. Was told ""phone is too old, can't use Smart Switch"". Come on, Samsung, these are both your phones and your software!"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone no signs of pervious wear!
yes,yes,yes,Product did not. Make it in time
yes,no,yes,It is irresponsible to send another article which one wants and does not reach
yes,yes,yes,Love my new phone. .works very well..should have been ordered it
yes,yes,yes,"I LOVE this phone. I'm still learning the fine points, but it's wonderful having a phone, mini-computer, camera, etc. at your fingertips. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a new phone."
yes,yes,yes,Finally I got a phone I like very much
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, does everything I need and more"
no,no,yes,The case is really cheap cracked first day I got it and I didn't drop it.
yes,yes,yes,I like galaxy phone better than androids
yes,yes,yes,Like it very much
yes,no,yes,Mines came in kinda broken and yet still gald about it being the real thing . Only if it came in fixed it would had been 5 stars and yet to get it fixed
yes,yes,yes,"Works very well, and looks as promised. Loving my new phone!"
yes,yes,yes,The phone works good but sometimes I don't get service.
no,yes,no,"Phone works for a couple of months until screen won't turn on. It was flickering green then just dark. No matter how much times i pressed the power button, it just won't activate. Disappointed that a good phone is going to waste because of a screen malfunction."
yes,yes,yes,"Had some very visible scratched around the frame of the screen. Other than that, as expected."
yes,yes,yes,Eeverything was fine well satisfy
yes,yes,yes,Can I use this phone in the caribbean
yes,yes,yes,Works great no complaints. Just wish it were cheaper to buy one for my dad.
yes,yes,yes,I ordered two phones and they are both in great condition and work excellent. They are like new and are unlocked to be used in the Caribbean.
yes,yes,yes,Phone came quickly and as advertised. Phone was new and came in original sealed Samsung box. I wanted to use thus phone on Consumer Cellular system. Signed up. They sent me a SIM card and assisted me with settings over the telephone. Phone was up and running in ten minutes. Everything works great.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this as an Android entree after living in the MS / WP universe. Very quickly received Marshmallow updates and comes preloaded with ATT apps (which can be disabled). Not a heavy user but still max out the storage regularly. G Plus has more for the money, but I wanted a screen under 5.5."
yes,yes,yes,Looked new worked great... got it for the WIFii calling mode.
yes,yes,yes,"Loved my S4 so got an S5. These were the smallest phones I could find. The camera is slow, I would prefer to NOT have a cover for the charging cable. Other than that it's a good phone."
no,no,no,"I purchased it online. Got a defective phone, the mic doesn't work."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works beautifully, even though it's said at&t phone, but I use it on tmobile. There are no problem at all. Everything works out as it should be."
no,yes,no,"Do not get the G900A model. That is the AT&T version with a locked bootloader that can't be unlocked. So, if you plan on rooting it etc, get a different model (eg. G900T etc). Also, the OS is android 4.4.2 which is outdated and insecure.."
yes,no,yes,I like the sleek nature.
yes,yes,yes,Pic taking & emailing is fast and easy Wouldn't trade for another
yes,yes,yes,Samsung galaxy s5 is excellent condition. working perfect.
yes,yes,yes,"Just bought it recently, even though it is not the newest model. I don't ask much out of my cellphones, but it does have a great screen, great camera, surprisingly long lasting battery and fast internet over WiFi."
yes,yes,yes,wish it had been equipped with a sim card
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone shipped on time, new in original box with charger block, cord, battery and ear buds, along with all documentation. Just what I was looking for, delivered when I needed it. Would not hesitate to buy again, great experience."
yes,yes,yes,Love my Galaxy S5 it was an easy transition from the older S4.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone was two generations old when I purchased it. While not the latest Galaxy, it has outstanding speed and great features. All at a very reasonable price, espcially compared to the newest high end phones."
yes,yes,yes,"Still a great phone despite its original release date. The phone I received was running Android 5.0, not 5.1 as indicated in the website product description. I am happy with its performance and battery life."
yes,yes,yes,"Works great, it's a AT&T phone, but I used it on the Consumer Cellular Network , only draw back, filled with AT&T apps which I don't use and I had to call CC to manually set up one of the settings."
yes,yes,yes,A Great upgrade from my S3.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is good in almost all aspects, the hearing auality is good, it is quite fast, the camera is good and the battery life is pretty good. The 2 drawbacks are: 1. The huge amount of unnecessary software form AT&T that comes bundled with it. 2."
yes,yes,yes,I think the S5 is the best phone that Samsung makes. Water resistant and you can change the battery if needed.
yes,yes,yes,"It's water proof. (alreaady checked by accident) It has a replaceable battery and It has an ultra saving power mode, also external SD memory. This is my second Galaxy cell phone. The Galaxay S5 design is good and functional."
yes,yes,yes,The phone was easy to get running on the AT&T network. I have been very pleased with the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Did some research, bought the one I wanted. Does more than expected"
yes,yes,yes,"Good price, great service, and exactly what I ordered. I did lots of research and shopping and think overall this is the best, both in product and where I purchased it from. I have had it up and running for 3 days now. Hoping it continues to be a positive experience."
yes,yes,yes,Learning to use this phone is easy even for a non tech savvy person.
yes,yes,yes,"I ordered this phone to replace my older S3. I did not want to spend $$$ for the latest model. Transferring data was easy - used the Samsung transfer and AT&T data transfer software. Took SIM card from old phone and put into S5 .. Plug and play,..."
yes,yes,yes,"I had bought an Asus Zenphone 2 ( a little piece of garbage) and after two with problem I decided to buy this Galaxy S5. It is quite fast and very reliable; however, as most smart phones, the battery is still an issue. My S5 with a moderate usage, takes maximum of two days to run out of battery."
yes,yes,yes,"A great bang for the buck. Theres no reason to spend twice as much on a S6 that its made in Vietnam, this one is made in Korea and specs are almos the same."
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 was a replacement for my S3 which was 4 yrs old and starting to have issues, I use the Samsung transfer and ATT transfer and copying data was about as easy as it gets. SIM card was removed from old phone and worked flawlessly in new phone. Plug n play .."
yes,no,no,"Order came quickly, product description accurate. This is the second unlocked Samsung I have purchased. The one-year warranty is unbeatable!!!"
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. Product received quickly and as described. Would recommend.
yes,yes,yes,great phone good price and 1 year warranty
yes,yes,yes,I updated my S4 to this one. Faster. Nice cameras.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent deal and brilliant phone. love it.
no,yes,no,"The good: similar in performance to an iPhone 5. The bad: it uses USB 3 cable (yes, it does fit micro USB too) with annoying flip cover The ugly: the speaker is absolutely horrific - it distorts massively at medium volume and above. Calls sound like from another planet. Distorts voice too."
yes,yes,yes,it`s a very good product
yes,yes,yes,nice product and good personal
yes,yes,yes,I will recomendet a great phone
yes,yes,no,I upgraded from a Galaxy S3. I had no trouble getting the G5 to work with the Consumer Cellular network. I just moved the SIM card from the S3 to the S5 and was up and running. The S5 is much faster and with the larger internal memory is easier to use.
yes,yes,yes,El envo se realiz en tiempo y forma y el producto funciona de maravillas. Recomiendo comprar en este lugar.
yes,yes,yes,Great for our work force to use. One of the best products ever!
yes,yes,yes,"Great product, fair price"
yes,no,yes,"The phone arrived promptly, and was in perfect shape. Everything was as advertised. Activating it was a simple matter of transferring the SIM card and memory card from my old AT&T phone to the new S5 phone. I am very pleased with it."
yes,yes,yes,Easy to buy. Easy to set up. Easy to use. It's the home of the easy living.
yes,yes,yes,Although this phone has been replaced by newer versions; it does the job I need a phone to do for me. The waterproof and dust proof feature makes it a good fit since I ride a motorcycle a lot and you never know when you will hit rain.
yes,yes,yes,"Truly a powerful device. It brings up web pages nearly as fast as my desktop computer. I'm running it on the Cricket network, which uses AT&T's towers; I also use it on Wi-Fi. I use it for Phone, text, internet, navigation, photos/video, voice recorder/text notes."
yes,yes,yes,"Fast, nice display. Used every day all day and the battery is better and better, last a whole day without a need to charge."
yes,yes,yes,Everything as I expected.
yes,yes,yes,Easy to use right out of the box. Super camera. Much better then my old Iphone
yes,yes,yes,"I love the IR blaster to control my TV's, blue ray, AV receiver etc. The large display is beautiful and the processor is so fast there is no lag. I uninstalled and disabled most of the AT&T and Samsung bloatware apps and my battery lasts all day with 15% to spare at bedtime."
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone that was rated #1 by Consumer Reports recently. It does everything I want.
yes,yes,yes,I just bought the S5 instead of the s6. I wanted to have the ability to add a SIM card and replace the battery myself. I have an older S3 and the new phone is a huge improvement.
yes,yes,yes,after 3 brands this is the one.  Att hook up was easy. file transfers just a bump away. no data lost from Samsung 111.
no,yes,yes,"I tried ""tethering"" and could not do it. Had to get rid of the phone, but the same brand and model but under T-Mobile. I am now happily tethering."
no,yes,yes,"Received complete as advertised, and on schedule. Activated without any problems at carriers store."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the last Gen of Galaxy line with removable battery and SD card slot; and with water resistance capability. Would recommend it if you don't want to be ""lock up"" in the S6 like iPhone."
no,no,no,"I bought an unlocked phone, yes I could see that, but I was never told it was an International model and not serviced by Samsung. Why wasn't this listed in plain sight so I would know what I was buying. Buyer beware!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"It's an awesome phone i have used so far. Switched from iphone to this phone and decided to never go back. Out of all samsung models including the recent s6, this is the best model i like."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone was as described and brand new. No troubloe getting AT&T to set it up for free, providing a sim card and moving the data card from the old phone. The AT&T guy asked where I got it and what I paid. He said I got a great deal. I love the screen and the features."
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from a Galaxy s3 to an s5 and I love it. Much faster than my old phone and a love the built in step counter and heart rate monitor!
yes,yes,yes,"You delivered a great product at a great price. Brand new, unlocked. My girlfriends been using it for over a week. No problems. Went straight to Cricket Wireless and in 30 minutes she was up and running."
yes,yes,yes,Came on time brand new as described. Galaxy s5. Enough said
yes,yes,yes,"I don't use mobile calling that much but I do want to use some apps such as bus tracker, Skype, compass, flashlight, memo, and definitely eBooks. This phone charges super fast (< 2 hrs.), probably because the battery is new."
yes,yes,yes,Phone was indeed new. I am extremely happy with my purchase.
yes,yes,yes,"It is very good product, good speed working, small size, battery have long life. Good phone for not too much money. I recomended :]"
yes,yes,yes,"Mostly the same as previous version. Not fond of all the changes, but overall it's fine."
yes,yes,yes,bought the S-5 900a model to use with our tmobile carrier. this model is recomended for tmobile users. easy set up at store. make sure you tell the tech that it's an AT&T model so they can modify the internet settings. this is the second one we have purchased and will continue as needed.
yes,no,yes,"I got the phone and was exactly the same as they advertise ,unlocked ,I just put my sim card in and change one setting and was ready for work I really like it"
yes,yes,yes,Changed from a Windows phone to this Samsung S5 android phone. I feel like I'm finally in the application loop after the sparse offerings and incomplete workings of windows apps. Phone works like a charm. Pulled my AT&T GoPhone sim card from the windows phone and inserted into the Samsung phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I moved from iphone and am very plased with the phone. The feel of the phone is good. he speaker is loud and clear, reception for both the phone and wifi is also great."
no,no,yes,"I use the phone for calls, navigation, searches.  I like the screen that indicates all the apps you have open, and the fact that you can swipe left and clear each as desired, and do that also on the notices screen."
yes,no,yes,"I bought this unlocked to used for my T-mobile network and so far it seems pretty good, the S5 is fast and reliable even though reception in my area (T-mobile)is only 2-3 bars. battery last 2 days before each charges. I only own this phone for about 2 weeks so will see how it does in the long run"
yes,yes,yes,Upgraded my Galaxy S3 and purchased the S5. Transferred my flash card and Sims card and was running in a few minutes.
yes,yes,yes,"I have always purchased Samsung products but will not anymore. I was replacing a Samsung S5 that was less than one year old because of charging issues and thought it was a fluke, but after recieving a brand new Samsung S5, same issue right out of the box, I also had a S4 and it has the sim card not..."
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 Galaxy is a pretty sleek upgrade from my SII Skyrocket in that the screen is much bigger and the system is faster, but I would not trust the 'water-resistant' advertising more than a splash of rain or sweat."
no,no,no,"The central part of the touchscreen doesnt work, it has no response and that was validated by factorys test."
yes,yes,yes,"So, I upgraded to this Samsung from my previous Samsung S4 mini. That phone was several years old, it was slow, certain apps weren't compatible, and the camera sucked. This phone is WAY BETTER."
yes,no,no,"Getting an unblocked phone to be able to use it overseas with different SIM card requires for the customer to upgrade the phone with your carrier. In my case Consumer Cellular. Otherwise, forward would not work as well as other systems."
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone. I had the S3 and it got tired; this was still the best choice for me. But it is my 2nd one. The first one fell 12 inches from my pocket onto uneven pavement and the screen cracked.
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S5 phone IS wonderful, it is unlocked; I bought it for use with the Consumer Cellular network and it works very well. I think it's even better than the S6 since I didn't want to go larger. The only fly in the ointment is the pre-installed AT&T software."
yes,yes,yes,"In choosing the Galaxy s5, the long battery life and ruggedness (highly water-resistant!) were great selling points, making it easy to choose this over the significantly higher-priced, though similarly-featured with just a few different bells and whistles, s6!"
yes,yes,yes,"great phone,large screen that is bright and clear. Comes with easy start guide which helps on use of basic features and buttons. Battery life is great and charges fast."
yes,yes,yes,This was a gift for my wife who is a very heavy social media user. It replaced an older Sony Xperia. I was given the opportunity to test drive it for some time. My personal devices are a brand new iPhone 6 and an older Galaxy S3.
yes,yes,yes,I spend my time between Mexico and a place in the mountains in California. I needed a phone that could get reception in my area of CA and with a removable SIM card for when I am in Mexico. So far I don't have any misgivings and definitely buy again.
yes,yes,yes,"I wanted a nice phone for use on Straight Talk. The Galaxy S5 works perfectly, easy to set up. Just insert ths Straight Talk SIM card, activate on line and call Straight Talk to register APN. Up and running in less than an hour.  Charger that came with it didn't work but I had other Samsung chargers."
yes,yes,yes,"Got this for my daughter, it's faster than the ASUS mini-notebook she had been using for the last four years! Picked this phone because it still has a user replaceable battery, and is water resistant. She loves the blue color."
no,no,no,The phone is unlocked but some utilities as wifi hotspot it is locked by at&t software pre instaled.  Do not buy this phone for use with other carrier. A lot of functions are locked.
yes,yes,yes,I rarely rate anything a 10 but this phone is amazing in every category. ...Samsung has always been ahead of its time. Superior to any smart phone I ever used.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded my wife to an Android phone from iOS. This was by far the best deal available for an S5! I received it promptly and it was exactly as described. A quick swap of the SIM from the old phone to new and I was up and running in no time. I could not be happier.
yes,yes,yes,I wanted a smartphone with a camera for my daughter who is becoming interested in taking picture and sending them to friends. It's specs easily match or beat the iphone6. When I found out it had a replaceble battery and was waterproof I was sold.
yes,yes,yes,"Top phone on the Market, this was unlocked, came quick and no issues!"
yes,yes,yes,I love the Samsung Galaxy S5. I had Nexus 4 earlier and now switched over to S5. I don't know why I did not decide to switch to this phone earlier :) I should have done that. I am impressed with the phone. Looks slim and light weight.
yes,yes,yes,Bought for a gift for my wife and phone worked right out of box. The only thing that we had to change was the sim card from her old phone since it was not lte combatable. Ordered the phone on tuesday and got it the next day. Great company to deal with
yes,yes,yes,"I'd prefer to give it more stars than 5. Great features, fast, fits in pocket yet big screen. In my opinion best smartphone on the market."
yes,yes,yes,Finally a mobile device that meets all my needs. I do everything with this wee little beastie.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone works great. Initially, the battery wouldn't charge fully, but just leaving it on the charger over night, even though it was showing full already. It's done well since. This phone is fast! It has USB 3.0 and is completely adjustable to my liking. This is a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I had been considering moving to a Galaxy S5 from an iPhone for a long time and when I found this deal, it seemed to good to be true. AT&T couldn't come close to matching this deal and wouldn't even try."
yes,yes,yes,"So far it just works great. The camera is incredible. The screen is bright and clear. But mostly, everything just does what it should."
yes,yes,yes,Works great with ATT.
yes,no,yes,it's not in v good condition
yes,yes,yes,samsung not so good
no,yes,no,I had to returned it. Because it looks used. I didnt feel good woth it. Sorry
no,no,no,RETURNED LOOKS USED
no,no,no,I don't see any reason why people should waste money buying S6 or S7. This phone has all the features you will actually use as good as other phones and is at half the price.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. ...love it
yes,yes,yes,"I am super happy that I got the Samsung S5. I got it about 1 month ago from SCE Enterprise. I picked it for its camera, and I have been continuously impressed at the resolution. The system provides various special features, e.g."
no,yes,yes,"After having my s4 safely in my possession for years, it finally fell and the screen broke. I was advised to get a new phone rather than having the screen replaced. Although I was sad at the loss (I'll miss you, dear S4), I was also excited that I was obtaining a new phone."
no,yes,yes,"Really disappointed. I had the S3 and bought this because I loved the camera and operating system of the S3, and the S5 is supposed to be better with higher spec. However, all the pictures I have taken on this new S5 have been quite blurry."
yes,no,yes,works great with my Straight Talk Service!!!
no,no,no,"It didnt come as a referb, the upper left of side of the screen wasn't properly attached, so theres an ugly cloudly mark inside the screen, the corners were scratched and dented, and the back cover of the phone was ripped slightly on the side making the back of it not entirely waterproof."
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with purchase. I have had 4 phones in the past year. Needless to say I'm very hard on them! I have returned to Samsung as the other brands just didn't measure up. I use Straight Talk and have for years. Had no problems changing over, just check to make sure it works in your area!"
no,no,no,"Wished I stayed with iPhone. Some calls are garbled, notice to close charging port even when it is closed, cover to port broke off without being abused. Screen very sensitive often times not holding phone exactly right the screen changes to something else."
no,no,no,"Unfortunately, although the phone was brand new in box, the screen itself did not work. It would ""turn on"" and ""work"" but the screen wouldn't turn on even though touch was working. I basically received a broken phone, although I don't think it's because of any fault of their own. The phone just..."
yes,no,yes,"IPHONE user for years, Android has come a long way since the Motorola zoom. This phone took the place of my iPhone and ipad. Typing is easy and the screen size is just right. This galaxy is just as simple as the iPhone with more options now."
no,no,no,"Water insulation this off Water insulation is taken off in the port of loading, which is seen is of poor quality. It is one expensive equipment, must not have cosmetic defects. That means the phone is defective. It is no longer waterproof. The insulation should not took off."
no,yes,yes,The AT&T version of the phone is not the same as the T-Mobile. 1. There is no wi-fi calling feature when you switch the phone over to a different carrier. 2. When at full volume the speaker kind of sounds choppy. There indeed is a tick sound when playing music. 3.
yes,yes,yes,"Well, this Galaxy S5 is a significant improvement over the Galaxy S3 I had. My main motivation was to get a better camera and a better display. On both counts, I have not been disappointed."
no,yes,yes,"The phone works fine for the most part, but can't receive group texts or imagines through its built in Messages application. It attempts to download them but never does so even when connected to wifi."
no,yes,no,"Liked phone. It was sold as new, but I had reservation due some problems with use. I had to return it."
no,yes,yes,"The phone came with a flaw because it restarts every 30 seconds, Samsung Venezuela I took it and I will updated the software but the failure persisted and I said could not open it because it had been acquired in Latin America, I spent a lot of money at the cellular and on nationalization I owe taxes..."
yes,no,yes,"I've had this less than 1 week so far. It keeps the charge very well. With the 4G enabled whole day, it charge only dropped down to 60%. Adding to that about an hour talk time. (My previous galaxy S2 ran completely out of charge at the end of the day even without doing any thing, if 4G was on) I..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, but one suggestion. If it is going to be sold as ""unlocked"", root the phone so that it is possible to remove all of the original provider's junk. Unlocked or not, it still operates like a phone I would have expected from one of the providers: Apps launch on startup, and run in the..."
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone but the fingerprint scanner feature does not work. I called Samsung about this and they told me that due to the recent Android update, the fingerprint function would not operate until a waiting period of 48-hours."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone ,it has so my great apps and is easy to use."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone! It came quickly and was unlocked and the model I ordered, and my changing carriers worked fine. Many great features on phone and beautiful display. A great improvement over my iPhone 4 in so many ways"
no,yes,no,It's good. Sometimes it hangs due to process overload. Sometimes it get hot while browsing or talking. Also the camera pictures are not good compare to s4.
no,no,yes,When I got this phone it was supposed to work internationally. It doesn't. I tried it. It only works with 4G. Not all Galaxy S5's are the same. Depends the carrier you have. If At&t it will only work with 4G networks. Otherwise it will not. The SM-G900A is for At&t.
yes,yes,yes,"great phone, only cons: yo can not use the wifi spot in this att phone, as this feature is blocked."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and just what i wanted. I would recommend this phone to anyone that likes android phones. I changed from apple to this phone
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Streaming videos, movies, etc. is excellent with a great, clear picture. I am greatly impressed."
yes,yes,yes,Completely satisfied with this phone. Nothing to complain about.
no,yes,yes,I have had the phone worked for a week now in a South American country that operates with Claro carrier. I had to update a firmware to verify that this phone could be compatible with my services in Ecuador and that was only a 20$ extra for it.
yes,yes,yes,"I really liked the phone and this was excellent. Though still need to verify/check all the features, but so far its good."
yes,yes,yes,"Works, and easily able to upgrade from my previous At&t phone to this one."
yes,yes,yes,"Extremely happy with it. Excellent right out of the box. My first Android phone so I'm still learning but I have voice, text, data and apps what more could you want?"
yes,yes,yes,"the phone works great except it won't allow it to be used as a wifi hotspot on any network other than AT&T, i'm using it on Cricket's network that is owned by AT&T so i assumed that it would work like my old S3 did that was also on Crickets network but that was a UK unlocked phone that only had 3G..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone shipped on time, new in original box with charger block, cord, battery and ear buds, along with all documentation. Just what I was looking for, delivered when I needed it. Would not hesitate to buy again, great experience."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this phone for around 1-2weeks. Thus far, I feel good. It is a genuine S5 phone tested by software. Recommended."
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy this phone however I admit to still learning how to operate it. Lots of options.
yes,yes,yes,excellent 100 % responsabilite
yes,yes,yes,I ordered this phone for when I travel back to my home country. It came unlocked and ready to use. I love it. Works like a charm.
no,yes,no,"Charging cover broke within 2 weeks and my Wifi signal drops constantly, but overall a decent phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing smartphone, very versatile. Love it."
yes,no,yes,Enjoy this phone very much.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is AMAZING! I am currently using it with T Mobile and I don't have a single complaint! Very satisfied with delivery and the product.
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy customer. Satisfied with this purchase and product. Excellent working condition, no cosmetic damage and delivery was right on time. Thank you."
yes,yes,yes,Arrived as promised..Product is as stated..
yes,no,yes,"did buy couple of these for my family and even though I am not a user myself, I can say that they are incredibly happy with these samsung's. reliable at best, never fail, never slow down processing, never tire. screen is amazing and they say -and so i think - about the right size!"
no,yes,yes,"Sent me a white phone, desctiption says black. Phone had visible damages around the edges. Description said light scratches."
yes,yes,yes,Works fine with T-Mobile. Comes with a bunch of AT&T apps I don't need.
yes,no,yes,The voice reception was not clear.
no,yes,yes,"Hello, the phone is great, its unlocked but at&t blocked to other users to use the hotspot .. not fear"
yes,yes,yes,A very good phone. It was what I expected and more. It works very well with Straight Talk.
yes,yes,yes,It's awesome I'm enjoying my s5
yes,yes,yes,The S5 was all I expected and more having come from a Motorola Bravo.
yes,yes,yes,"It's great phone,I like it.So far working good."
yes,yes,yes,i bought this phone a couple weeks ago and love it the picture quality is amazing! the speed it processes is great. its easy to use i would definitely recommend it to anyone.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung S5 has (so far) lived up to the reviews and expectations that online reviews have given it. I've continued to find the abundance of features that made me glad that I jumped from the S3 to the S5. Some of the features like the air gestures are just a gimmick.
no,no,yes,Low quality and battery damage not worth it
yes,yes,yes,little scratches on the side but it works fine came on time
yes,yes,yes,Works great on Net 10 here in PR.
yes,yes,yes,"Nice cellphone. I've been using it a lot and I have not had problems at all. I had a S4 before, I have to confess that there are no many differences between S4 and S5."
yes,yes,yes,It is so great. Has a lot of easy ...
yes,yes,yes,"I love this samsung galaxy s5 really everything Is Fine & nothing problem, even the price is fair."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone great price!
no,yes,yes,"LCD screen broke within 4 months of buying it. Its a great phone, I have had one for over 3 years that I got from tmobile. I got one from here and it lasts 4 months? Seems a little odd to me.....AND IF YOU DO BUY THIS THE INSURANCE IS POINTLESS DONT DO IT!!!!!"
no,yes,yes,Phone will not stay charged
no,yes,yes,the phone I received is even better than my original S5. I bought this one because the screen on my original S5 is cracked. I wanted to get another S5 while they are still available as all newer Samsung phones don't allow for the replacement of the battery.
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone. It was nicely packaged and works great. Was able to use a sim card from Straight Talk to use this phone.
yes,yes,yes,LOVE IT...BUT BROKE DOWN AFTER 2.5 MONTHS OF USE....IT'S A BRAND NEW PHONE WITH NO MENTION OF A WARRENTEE..DUHHH...
no,no,no,I got a defective product
yes,yes,yes,The phone works just like my other S5 did. It has been working great for the last 4 months.
no,no,no,I returned this as it was the wrong phone I ordered. Was as described in original packaging.
no,yes,no,the battery failed within 24 hours
yes,yes,yes,"The battery that came with the phone doesn't last half a day with minimum use from the day I started using it. I bought a similar phone 4 months prior for a friend and it works well, battery lasts a day at least."
no,yes,yes,"Phone was not unlock, could not add sprint services."
yes,yes,yes,Has exceeded all expectations. Just the right size. Takes incredible pictures. Got it to stream movies more than as a phone. Very happy.
yes,yes,yes,"I live in Peru and bought this phone for my son. I found two problems, the first one that it is an ATT iphone and the Android software is pretty old (2014) and it can not be updated without an ATT chip or outside USA, I was expecting the phone with the last version or the previous one at least."
yes,no,yes,It has a defect in its frame. It was not supplied in its original packing. The protecting stamp
yes,yes,yes,"Fits snug on my Galaxy S5. Offers gr3at protection on all corners, feels sleek and good to hold."
no,yes,no,This phone lasted 3 months. I purchased it for an Ethiopian computer software engineering student. The screen went blank and was unable to be fixed. I fully understand the warranty and that I spent $200 or so foolishly but others should be cautious.
no,no,yes,"absolutely hated it,just because it was not unlocked."
no,no,no,"Just bought this phone and it's not unlocked, keeps asking for code, completely wasted my money. Plus when I go online ( using wifi) and try to watch videos it glitches so you can hear it but not see it and the USB cover is chipped."
no,no,no,"barely worked, told it was sim card problem and by the time we tried a new sim card the return date had passed. Don't trust Supreme Deals 18. Buy your phone elsewhere. The phone won't read the sim card."
no,no,no,Camera doesn't work. Seller will not send me email address to return phone and get another. Sad.
yes,yes,yes,Working great. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,working great thus far...i use this with Ting as my carrier
no,no,no,Dosent even turn on came broken
yes,yes,yes,"Very good phone. Arrived in very good state but was missing headsets. And the packaging wasn't very good in terms of protection against shock. But it's a very good phone, totally awesome. Am enjoying it so very much."
yes,yes,yes,To use Bluetooth you have to keep the device within 6 inches. Other than that it is decent but there are many better than this on
yes,no,yes,"Battery runs out too quick, but phone is reliable and fast. Camera is good."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. Price was right
yes,yes,yes,Thank you so much
no,yes,yes,Couldn't read SIM card
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone! I love it.
yes,yes,yes,I got this for my son who is even more techno-phobic (is that even a word??) than I am. He learned to use it very quickly and he is very happy with it. It does the job and is rather intuitive.
no,no,no,"This phone was originally an AT&T phone. It comes UNLOCKED, and hence any BUGS that were later fixed by AT&T are now NOT SUPPORTED. What does that mean? If you put your SIMS card into the phone, you may be lucky enough to CALL OUT, and RECEIVE calls, using your phone carrier."
yes,yes,yes,I can actívate this phone in mexico
yes,yes,yes,"It was a good buy, would recommend it"
yes,yes,yes,Upgrade from samsung 4 . great replacement
yes,yes,yes,The phone is not good
yes,yes,yes,Am very satisfied.
no,no,no,"I purchased this phone in late November of 2016 and now it won't turn on. First off, the charger that came with it never worked. Secondly, I ordered a ""new"" phone but I'm pretty sure the one I received was a used phone because it didn't even look new. It had dents on it."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome quality phone!
yes,yes,yes,Came with the wrong charging cord but luckily we have one already. Phone works great so far.
yes,yes,no,"My problem, with the phone is the numerous AT&T apps loaded into it. I actually expected a non customized phone not AT&T phone."
yes,yes,yes,Another great product at a great price. Great transaction!
yes,yes,yes,Extremely pleased with this phone. My last was a smart phone (not this brand) but nowhere near as good as this! I can now do lots of things I either struggled to or couldn't even do.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. It met all my expectations. I added a wireless charger to the phone which works very well.
yes,yes,yes,Nice while it lasted but within 2 weeks it was nonfunctional and unresponsive to professionals attempting to revive it...wound up buying a new S7
no,yes,yes,The phone was unusable
yes,yes,yes,"First, the good things: great camera and the phone is easy to use with many nice features. Not so good: flimsy housing; the port cover has already broken off and the screen is popping off slowly but surely. I've only had the phone a couple of months."
no,no,no,"I have this phone for about a month now.The phone basically is ok.Battery life sucks. A little chat on WhatsApp, and all the charge is gone. Other disappointment was that the charger that came with it doesn't work at all from the beginning (I have been charging with my old charger)."
no,yes,no,"I sent the phone to someone else to use, but I haven't received any complaints."
yes,yes,yes,phone is working well.
no,yes,no,cellphone advertised as unlocked is locked.
yes,yes,yes,Purchased this device for my mother to replace her infamous LG G4 stylo that had that wonderful update bug on boost mobile that ate up all her system memory and slowed the phone to a crawl.
no,no,no,"Shorting with battery, Senor problem inadequate detection."
no,no,no,"I believe this phone is probably nearly new, but I could tell it had been used by someone before. The screen went black twice in the first two hours of use and had to be rebooted each time. I suspect the same defective phone is sold repeatedly until someone unwittingly buys and keeps it."
no,yes,yes,The phone is average.volumme is too low.
no,no,yes,Love the phone but it broke after 3 months of having it. I droped it with an otter box phone case and when I went to see if it was ok the screen didn't work anymore. I could hear sounds and everything but the screen was just black. After 3 or 2 hours the phone completely stopped working.
no,no,no,Speaker phone is not working and depend on what you doing the screen turn black
yes,yes,yes,Phone worked as described and as reviewed. No issues thusbands far.
yes,yes,yes,This phone was sold as new. It was not new. According to Samsung it had previously been registered to another number. Buyer beware!
no,yes,no,"Buggy, It freezes a lot."
yes,yes,yes,"I don't know about the rest of you, but I received exactly what I wanted. A brand-new galaxy phone. Fresh out of the box. Works great so far. Still just as good as the newer models, does everything they do just about. It's perfect."
yes,yes,yes,This is not the phone I ordered.It comes with AT&T network and I ordered T-Mobile. The protection tab on the bottom of the phone is not connected and does not fit into the hole correctly where you charge the unit. So it compromises it being water proof.
yes,yes,yes,Works well and everything just as described
no,yes,yes,So far so good! Works great no bug issues. Came brand new! Edit: I'm returning it due to the screen no longer working all of a sudden. Apparently its a very common problem. I tried researching the issue and calling tech support...no luck on fixing it.
yes,yes,yes,"Its a good phone, unfortunatly it has a lot of at&t features and it can't be easyly update to a newer version of android. Its very nice, great size, radio FM is missed."
no,yes,no,"Bought this phone as a gift for someone. Very disappointed. It got our hopes up and finally when it arrived, the phone didn't function properly. It was suppose to be a new Unlocked galaxy s5."
yes,yes,yes,Thanks my Fiance loves his new phone. He ended up wanting to keep this one instead.
no,yes,yes,The signal strength is so weak on the Simple Mobile network.
no,yes,no,Charging the phone takes so much time. For eg- for charging 20% it takes 1 hour. Also battery drained very fast. Looks like there is some issue in battery. I think I should return the phone. Not happy :(
no,no,no,I bought this phone for my brother 4 months ago. He placed a case from the box and now the back cover is falling apart. Poor quality.
yes,yes,yes,A quick arrived wonderful phone I have used 3 months.
yes,yes,yes,"Yes yes very much so, we are extremely pleased with our purchase and will recommend to family and friends"
no,yes,no,Hello dear Excuse me i need help I just received the phone and i have met a problem . I have a lycamobile sim and When i turn on it they request a pin number i mean at&t pin because it is locked i need this pin.
no,yes,no,After 5 minutes of use for a phone call my voice would become distorted and un-audible. Phone would become very hot to the touch during charging to the point it would leave a burn mark on the surface it was laying upon. Eventually the phone stopped accepting a charge.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone for its price!
yes,yes,yes,"Main thing I was looking for in a new phone was a more reliable battery life. My iPhone would die overnight if I didn't charge it each day. So far, the Samsung can go several days with light use, and still be set on battery. Love it! Camera is great! Interface is fairly user friendly."
yes,yes,yes,Just a great Phone!
no,no,no,Went bad and unusable within a month. Screen completely froze.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from Samsung Galaxy S4 and this is a great smart phone. I've been using it for about a month without any problem with AT&T.
no,no,no,Batterry is horrible out of box. Will not last a day with little use.
yes,yes,yes,Very Happy with the S5
yes,yes,yes,"It is generally a good model. Light, fast, easy to use, and the ugly Samsung UI is partly offset by the cellphone's superior performance. Only drawback I have to point out is this particular model (G900A) has Bitlocker so it is nearly impossible to ROOT it."
no,no,no,"At first i thought there was a problem with the phone as it wasn't turning on or charging. But the problem was that charger was defective, luckily I had another charger to use otherwise this phone would have been useless."
no,no,yes,I have been trying to get my Sister a Galaxy S5 since the beginning of December (it's the end of January now) there seems to always be something wrong though. First one (from BREED) was missing a water protection cover for a small piece in the back by the battery. Sent it back paid S&H.
yes,no,yes,"It's good, it's just that it doesn't really hold battery for too long. The battery gets drain quick."
yes,yes,yes,Phone was exactly as described
no,yes,no,Good product! Bought it for my mom in Brazil but had to return because this model does not have brazilian portuguese. Refund was processed quickly.
yes,yes,yes,"Love it. It's so easy to use,"
yes,yes,yes,This model resist Water ?
no,no,no,"The phone wasn't working, turning on. Disappointed with purchasing non-working phone. Returned it same day."
yes,yes,yes,The phone works well with a few minor scratches and dents but that was detailed in the description. I have been using this and there has have been no major issues. I would purchase again but would probably step up to buy a phone in Great condition since on occasion a button will jam.
yes,yes,yes,Phone works great however the charger that came with it did not work.
yes,yes,yes,It's ok would have liked bigger
no,no,no,this phone being giving me problems from day one and i wants to send it back how can i do that please

yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. Easy enough to understand and graphics are really good
no,no,no,"Hi, I buyed this phone in November 2016, and then a month, my phone present a problem all of a sudden, my phone can turn on but the screen is black, I need help by this problem"
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung S5 highly functional efficient device'
no,no,no,"When I got this phone, it was a curse from the start. It had so many technical problems... The screen would freeze and not unlock. I wouldnt be able to text correctly, it would freeze constantly. The charger base didnt work from the start. Then the charger fell apart after a couple of days."
yes,yes,yes,Everything is ok except for there is a DOT on the screen where there is a pixel out
yes,no,yes,"I had a bad battery first, then I couldn't get on the internet. after a week of wifi only I took it to a technician who spent better then 20 min. with AT&T. They resolved the problem. As far as I can tell, everything seems to be OK."
no,no,no,"Ever since I received the smartphone the screen has not been working properly, and now it's almost impossible to use it, what should I do?"
no,yes,no,Came with the front panel/screen not fully attached. Sent back. Waiting for the refund. Also battery was terrible and the camera wasnt great at all.
no,no,no,"The charger and headphones have very bad quality, they are broken just 3 weeks after I bought the phone."
no,no,no,"Charger doesn't work with any of the samsung smartphones I have tested. I had to use my old motorolla charger to get it to work. The battery cover already has a small fracture in it, so I can't trust it with water anymore."
no,yes,yes,I need to know jf can change and how can i chance the language because i comes in chinese and I can't access to menu because the screen stay permanently in searching wifi!
no,yes,no,"After 3 weeks and several hours trying to fix it, I never got the Mobile data to work."
yes,yes,yes,The phone is good but I deducted a star because it not truly an unlocked international version like my Galaxy 4 was. This comes loaded with unremovable AT&T apps and of course a plethora of Samsung apps which are very pushy.
no,no,no,"I bought this phone back in May of 2016, so I only have almost 8 months of use out of it and the screen started flicking at low brightness levels about a month ago. I put a shock/dust/waterproof case on it since I received the phone and have not used the phone without it on."
yes,yes,yes,"Works Great on StraightTalk service. There are newer phones, and I won't go into the specs as they are in the decription, but the phone works great. Android 6.0 is fine for me. GPS locks fast, etc."
yes,yes,yes,"nice phone, great price. Would not sync to hotmail.com so no integration with MS Outlook."
no,no,no,Didnt work returned it
no,yes,no,"Poor - Used item, screen falling off, dirty. We did not see any indication on the description that this was the case with the item. We did understand that it was a GSM unlocked phone, which is what we needed."
yes,yes,yes,"Initially my husband bought an S5 for me so that I wouldn't have to carry a separate camera as I traveled abroad. It performed relatively well having good picture quality, but I thought I lost a day-and-a half of photos when the phone stopped recognizing the micro SD card."
no,yes,no,"The phone is woking fine but,the battery was defective."
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with my new phone! It seems easy to use and that's a good thing for us old Timers!
yes,yes,yes,I bought an S5 for my wife a couple of years ago and when I needed a new phone decided it was the best way to go for me as well. I don't care for the non-removable batteries and no expandable memory in the newer Samsung phones. Don't know what I will do when these phones die.
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, i can belive is so cheap now. good choice!"
yes,yes,no,Got this phone for my wife for Christmas. First of All it says it's unlocked and directly from the manufacturer Samsung but it was from AT&T. But that wasn't a problem seeing as how we have cricket wireless who accepts all carrier phones.
no,no,no,Hello. Untill now it is working Ok. maybe de screen is not very sensitive. I have a claim. The charger do not work.
no,no,no,"I had some issues with charging mine. It's awfully finicky if I use a wall charger so I use a car charger as much as possible. Also, my accelerometers don't seem to work at all. Pretty discouraging for getting a new phone."
yes,yes,yes,it just couldn't connect on wifi for some reason.....I had to go online and check for a solution and now it works perfectly!!!
yes,no,yes,"I live in Venezuela and access to the dollars is limited, since I buy it continuously drops in price and it bothers me !! I would have waited a couple of days"
yes,yes,yes,i could not get to sing on to playstore
yes,yes,yes,Very thing was as promised
no,no,yes,Good phone...had to fix the focus on the camera. Now it works well. Battery has to be charged two to three times a day..
yes,yes,yes,"Price is good and the phone is great considering it is 2 generations old, but for 1/3 the price of the s7, I'll take it!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is a nice phone working very well. no problem on it.
yes,yes,yes,"Love my Galaxy S5 on Verizon. Bought this version for my husband to experiment with Straight Talk using the At@T towers. Came with Kit Kat, Updated to Lollipop and now waiting for update to Marshmallow. Seems to be working fine. Husband is learning to use."
yes,yes,yes,"An absolutely gorgeous phone. Upgraded from a Motorola E2, I wanted a phone that had a replaceable battery and a larger screen. I was impressed by the Moto, blown away with the Galaxy resolution!"
no,no,yes,Came with att symbol and not inlocked as indicated 8n description
no,yes,no,"I recently purchased this phone ""new"", it was shipped to me faulty screen with other issues."
yes,yes,yes,"The bandwith doesn't go over 1900, so I can't use it for digitel in Venezuela In modus H+."
no,yes,yes,"The description didnt say there was anything wrong with the item, Well there is a hairline Crack in the screen and damage to the USB port, back cover and the water resistant gasket is out of alinement, also I had to clean the Dirt out of the crevices, it was pretty caked in there, the device Is..."
yes,yes,no,"Phone recieved in mint/New sealed packaging , looks great , functions great but for some reason it freezes and reboots itself randomly , its an AT&T unlocked phone , I am using it on a T Mobil acct."
yes,yes,yes,It's GRRRREAT!!!!! i Love it!!!
yes,yes,yes,"Works well in Canada. Doesn't seem to be the first choice phones from the manufacturer, I suddenly experience extreme lag and have to reboot about once every two weeks. No complaints other than that."
yes,yes,yes,Great company. Great phone.
yes,no,yes,I don't like it .it is not functioning right
no,no,no,"The charging micro USB port in my S5 broke after only 14 months--after about only at most 420 separate charging plugins (30 charges/month x 14 months). Of course, my warranty was only 12 months."
no,no,no,No it has some problem with WiFi connection
yes,yes,yes,Great cell phone. Nice camera with great quality! I love it! :-)
no,yes,no,The phone they sent me is defective. It turns itself off constantly.
yes,yes,yes,The phone works but regrettably it came preloaded with AT&T apps. We need to be made aware of this when we are purchasing phones. I do not have AT&T in my country so I am not interested in their services.
yes,yes,yes,I can't complain much about it. It does what it's meant to do and I'm happy with my purchase.
yes,yes,yes,VERY GOOD AND EXCELLENT PRODUCT DELIVERY
no,no,no,I have metropcs plan on this phone and It doesn't work when I go down in my basement. And my basement isn't even under ground.

yes,yes,yes,"Yes. It exceeded my expectations. Great phone, great features and wonderful quality. Works fantastic."
yes,yes,yes,so far only complaint is difficulty figuring out how to get nano sim card in it... and a bit of att junk software. you can root the phone but there's not root control software for this version yet.
yes,yes,yes,"First hand, I don't know because I bought it for my nephew 2 weeks ago and then had it shipped to him. He seems to like it so I guess so far it's a good deal."
yes,yes,yes,It's not working well
no,no,yes,"The screen broke within a couple of weeks, The phone was laggy and glitchy."
yes,no,yes,No problem. Phone excellent
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is just new and very nice. There is nothing to complain about, I'm glad to have this smartphone... :)"
no,yes,yes,It was a used cellphone with a Crack on the cover.
yes,no,yes,"Nice phone, works as it is supposed to EXCEPT for Wi-Fi calling. After purchasing the phone, I discovered that even though AT&T and T-Mobile phones will work on each other's networks, AT&T did not and still does not support Wi-Fi calling for Android phones."
yes,yes,yes,good phone other than couldn't get good signal anywhere I went even though I was on the same network as my previous phone. was new in box with a good price.
no,yes,yes,Great phone! but sometime I call someone they cant hear me or i cant hear them.
yes,yes,yes,"Great, so far so good"
yes,yes,yes,"I have not had one single problem with this phone. It was my first electronic purchase online and I was a little nervous about it. I would recommend the company this came from any time. Phone was new, in the box, still sealed. I've been using it for about a month and learning new things every day."
yes,no,no,"I've used the Galaxy S5 for the last 2 years, but it quit working properly. So I bought another S5. I don't need the most updated phone on the market."
no,yes,yes,"I would not buy this again. I went from S5 to S5 so I am an expert, and this S5 felt inauthentic. The backing supplied was cheap and cracked along the edges immediately, so I replaced it with the back from my previous."
no,no,no,"The front camera does not work, there is a black ring on the top size. I already return the cellphone."
no,yes,no,"Well when I saw it, it said it could be used with T mobile but for some reason it is not working well I have WiFi in my home and it refuses to work in my house. Even when I am out side it keeps buffering over and over it was definitely the worst purchase I ever made."
no,no,no,Phone is not work properly and bad speaker
no,yes,yes,used phone with new box
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is great, no issues, almost all Android apps are compatible with it. Only one issue, my back cover chipped and peeled within a week and I have to use duct tape to keep it on."
yes,yes,yes,Received wrong phone the first time but the second time I received the right phone. Still pretty fast for an older phone. Front camera SUCKS!! Other than that no complaints.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone . Some differences from S3 but works fine .
no,no,no,I am most upset item received damage .phone screen is lifting speaker also defective
no,no,no,"received phone on time. set up phone, transferred stuff from my old phone no problems. went to charge the phone about an hour after receiving it and it didn't want to start charging. after several attempts of removing and reinstalling the charging cable it finally started to charge."
yes,yes,yes,Love it. Great Deal
yes,yes,yes,"Nice features, moved up from S3"
yes,yes,yes,"Works great, screen is clear and bright, functions perfectly, and meets my expectations."
yes,yes,yes,Good phone but overheating
no,no,no,from the time i got it this was making no calls but i but just laeft it as that but right now its not even a year an this phone just wont come on for no reason just soo
no,yes,yes,Everything was great but the camera. The application keeps failing and new camera apps can only do front facing pictures.
yes,yes,yes,I had an iphone 4 and was hesitant to switch platforms. Samsung has a program you can install on your computer to transfer data from an iphone to a Samsung without any issues. That worked perfectly. I love the phone.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone! It charges and stays charged much faster than the iPhone I previously had.
no,no,no,"I used the phone for 3 weeks, then screen stopped working...now i have to replaced a screen i barely used."
no,no,yes,the battery came deffective! it doesnt last more than 4 hras and i barely used it!
yes,yes,yes,"Purchased this item on October 23, 2015. New, excellent GS5. My second GS5, for my kid. 1 point off because I found out the phone was still locked to ATT when I switched to a China Mobile sim card while we were travelling in China in June 2016."
no,no,yes,Every thing is great except that you guys sent me through wrong charger can you please send me the galaxy s5 charger and I'll return the android charger you sent me back thanks in advance
yes,yes,yes,"Really nice phone. A good compromise between lower and phones and the ridiculously expensive highest end ones. Only issue with it is for some reason, it seems to have lower reception and internet connectivity than my old LG phone while using the same metro-pcs provider."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first smart phone and although I was spoiled with my simple flip phone, I am learning to love the many features. I now take my phone everywhere."
no,yes,no,"I had to return this phone. As soon as I got it, I tried making some phone calls with it and five out of five people I talked to said they couldn't hear me well and that there was a lot of static in the background. I took the sim card out, switched to my old phone, and the problem was resolved."
yes,no,yes,"The phone works great as advertised, the battery last longer than my old Galaxy S4. I am using it for about 1 month and I had no problem with it. I am using it with a Straigh Talk plan in New York City and the network signal is not all the time full, but I asume that is a network problem and is not..."
no,no,yes,"I wanted to buy a ""new"" unlocked phone that would work on the AT&T network here in Alaska. I did a lot of research to ensure this model would work best on their network. It appears that most/ (maybe all) GSM phones with work world-wide on other GSM networks."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm using this phone on the MetroPCS network (T-Mobile's towers) and have zero complaints about it...which is very unusual for me. It has a great chip, screen, and camera, and if you're used to Samsung's overlay of Android, it's totally slick to use."
yes,yes,yes,This is an incredible phone. It is like carrying a small computer in my pocket.l It does everything well.
yes,yes,yes,"If you're shopping for a new Samsung smartphone, but are shocked by the prices, you may want to consider this one. It came new in the box; the only thing you'll have to get is a SD card for it."
yes,yes,yes,Had problems at first but with the warranty on it with Samsung it was fixed in no time.
yes,no,yes,Great phone! Upgraded from the Galaxy S3 and glad that I did. This phone came with AT&T bootloader and their default apps but not a big deal for me. This phone is definitely unlocked. I am using my T-Mobile sim card and have yet to experience any connection issues.
yes,yes,yes,"I got this phone so I could have a cheap, contract-free plan with T-Mobile, well little did I know that using a carrier that wasn't ATT I would never be able to update my phone from the factory stock OS."
yes,yes,yes,Works great on straight talk. I've got super fast 4g lte. I was a bit nervous because when I used the straight talk website to set up my APN settings I ended up with only 4g....I did some digging and found the 4G lte APN settings on YouTube.
yes,yes,yes,"Lots of bells and whistles that I have no use for, but otherwise great product. Particulalry like the camera, but have not used in low light situations yet."
yes,no,yes,"Excellent phone. I live in Ontario Canada (very hard to get an unlocked Samsung GS5 here) so I had to get this through family in the US... still cheaper than a no contract, unlocked one here through one of our major carriers, despite the currency exchange and the shipping."
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with my purchase! The price was great the phone came brand-new in the box with the accessories. I use MetroPCS and it is functional and everything works as described/expected.
yes,no,yes,It came promptly and packaged well. The phone is working and still getting use to it. And was compatible with Straight Talk. Glad chose it over Iphone
yes,yes,yes,"Works like a champ. This is a gift for my nephew in France (but he's going to US for school this fall). The phone works well in France and I think it will work well in US (as this is AT&T version, G900A). Took me a while to figure out what model to fit the need though. Very happy with this purchase."
yes,yes,yes,"Picture shows and other reviewers said they got a case with phone, I got only the phone. Works great on consumer cellular, they were great helping me set it up, used micro sim from phone I upgraded from, phone is actually a at&t phone, you can't uninstall their apps but you can turn them off in the..."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone was purchased for a Consumer Cellular contract. Delivery and price were excellent, and the phone works fine."
no,yes,yes,"I bought this item to connect it with cricket and it works well. It was clean and there was nothing wrong with the phone itself. I did have a problem with the charging cable, it worked once but never again. I just went to t-moble and got an original charger."
yes,yes,yes,I loved this phone defiantly one of my faves
no,no,no,"Bad internal antenna, but didn't realize it until too late to return. Money down the drain."
yes,yes,yes,"The item works very well for me, with 4G network even it has T&T logo on it, I use the GoSmart network and it is fine. I like it."
yes,no,yes,Like it..thank you
yes,no,yes,"It came in an original Samsung packaging, with all accessories (headphones, USB cord, charger, manuals). I had to order the screen protector separately. It is ATT branded and loaded with too much unnecessary junk. I can't figure out how to remove most of it, since I am not using it."
yes,yes,yes,Great camera. Easy to read text. Long battery life. Loving it!
yes,yes,yes,Great experience in regards to shipping on time and setup of phone
yes,yes,yes,Satisfied with the product
yes,no,yes,Great phone - but doesn't work well with MetroPCS.
yes,yes,yes,So far this phone is working perfectly. It has a very clear screen and all the options we need. It would have been helpful to have a manual included with the phone but the on-line manual has been helpful so far.
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good but my wife's phone has trouble with pictures and videos. Also when I Sbeam pics from one phone to the other, the pics are saved in download rather than on the SD card ...any way to fix that?"
yes,yes,yes,"I purchased this phone 6months ago. It works fine for most purposes, although it took quite a while to get it set up for Straighttalk service, but with persistence I got it almost fully functional. I gave it only 3 stars as it had several problems."
yes,yes,yes,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs."
yes,no,yes,was not working thank God I get my money back
yes,yes,yes,Great phone..I love it
yes,yes,yes,"Great deal! New phone, great price, arrived 5 days ahead of time"
yes,yes,yes,Very good mobile phone
yes,yes,yes,A great product for the price.
yes,yes,yes,Really good phone and the price is much lower than in the shops (£285). Received it within a week and works in the UK with the same features as a UK S5.
yes,yes,yes,"Well the Item is second hand. dont mind that when opened cover it was full of dirt, and dust. Bought It as a present. Big dissapointment"
yes,yes,yes,"excellent working phone, no problems at all. perfect in every way :-)"
yes,yes,yes,"Ships new in box with plastics still on. Right model, easy set up.... All in all, would buy again if I needed two phones."
yes,yes,yes,"It worked fantastically, just as advertised. Inserted the sim from the local provider in Costa Rica and all features worked as designed."
yes,yes,yes,"Had a Samsung device before so my expectations were high and they have been met. Sleek, lightweight. Actually lighter than my previous Galaxy Nexus i9250 which was smaller than it. Talking alarm clock, bigger screen, clean pictures at high focus all big pluses."
yes,yes,yes,This is a very fast phone i love it alot and yes i did get the 4G lte model SM-G900F it is 100% original stuff from samsung so u guys can go ahead and order if you want. It came with a uk adapter but you get a converter to change the pins back to US standards.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent cell phone! it works terrific with movistar ve. Available several languages including Spanish. recommended!
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent service, excellent product. It works perfect in my country."
yes,yes,yes,Worked 100% in Ecuador (no Spanish OS)
yes,yes,yes,I got what i need in it.

yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone! Have used this phone for about 2 months now. Works perfect. Not disjointed at all
yes,yes,yes,great samrtphone. easily activated for unlocking zone. works perfectly
yes,yes,yes,Simply loving it!
yes,yes,yes,I'm in love with my phone. So many many features. Top notch technology.
yes,yes,yes,"Good product, but I am not brought Vnezuela and Spanish, and with updates I could place"
yes,yes,yes,Everything worked really good with the cellphone. It's just as described and it works just fine in Costa Rica. I like it even more that the S4 as that one was unblocked but had some crazy T-Mobile software installed and was kind of annoying. This one is completely unlocked and works perfect. Thanks!
yes,yes,yes,Excellent smartphone although not shown in the photo and thought I'd say samsung on s5 spoiler part and not so says lte duos
yes,yes,yes,Awesome smartphone
yes,no,yes,like it but doesn't have any sing at the back indicating its as sumsung or galaxy s5 as shown on the page
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone
no,no,yes,the touch screen came non responsive
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is amazing except one thing: open the camera and gallery application is slower than an Iphone 5s, if you will test it, you'll find the cruel reality. Regarding the OS's I had only used Iphone before and it was easy adapted to Android, so don't be afraid to experience Android OS."
yes,yes,yes,this phone is just amazing!!! the pictures are incredible and everything else works great!! i definitely recommend this version of the S5 over the rest... although i did get the phone with two sim card slots not one like i ordered
yes,yes,yes,Just perfect. Exactly what I expected. I works on T-Mobile USA. For the moment I've just had the h+ but it's really fast. I ordered a SM G900F and I received a SM G900FD (duo sim) which is better for me because I use it in two countries ! I love it.
yes,yes,yes,"Great product, great experience."
no,no,no,Very bad. They are liar thief i lost my 594 dollar.be careful!!!
yes,yes,yes,the phone works great Iput a 128 gb sd card is work like a charm but is a H+ but is really nice phone
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product
yes,yes,yes,the phone works great the only thing is that as i read google make some issue for sandisk and kingston memory cards with the android version 4 and up it damages the cards
no,no,yes,"Received timely, new package, except that in the technical specifications do not indicate that a bulky adapter that is used in the UK is provided. Although a plug for American electric system is supplied."
yes,yes,yes,"Yes, its a great phone. About the best out there right now. Pro-great screen, pretty fast, and seems tough by the number of times I have already dropped it (i have a bump guard). Con- the price (wow!), the short battery life"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone, don't know if it works in Korea where I am for a year and haven't set it up yet but I'm sure it will be fine."
yes,yes,yes,"i love the phone it was a great buy, still tweaking it though, the one handed thumb finger only goes through 40% other fingers go though 95%"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent ! works perfectly in venezuela. The people that works in best buy samsung in mexico really help me and taught me a lot. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,Very good... Excellent work and attention.. Recommended
yes,yes,yes,You missed the manual
yes,yes,yes,Excelent Phone. Very fast.
yes,yes,yes,"Did not get the charger as seen in the pics go another one which i didn't need , im from Jamaica it works great i tested it on Digicel . Apart from the charger hick up the phone is awesome and everything else is great."
yes,yes,yes,The charge is not original samsung
yes,yes,yes,"Very fast, stable and a lot of useful tools. I think some items are useless for me, like the air view, but it may be useful for someone. It's a nice resource anyway. The remote control functionality and the use with chromecast is amazing. I think the S-view flip cover is mandatory."
no,no,no,the voice and hearing quality is bad. camera only ok. For the price I expected better quality of both
yes,yes,no,"If I could give zero stars, that is what I would give. Arrived with no android program. Absolute waste of money."
yes,yes,yes,The phone is great on the Straight Talk network. It was priced low but operates like a premium sell.
yes,yes,yes,Loved it worked perfectly
yes,yes,yes,Exactly as advertised. No unpleasant surprises here. Worked great out of the box.
yes,yes,yes,"Everything is perfect 4G LTE is working perfectly by AT&T, all description is right. Some people had a problem with phones, before buying please check the model, for example international unlocked cellphone for Samsung galaxy S5 is G900F."
yes,yes,yes,"Didn't want to sign a contract with a major phone company, plus I wanted sometime by the very next day, cause my S2 finally decided to hit the dust and flat out stopped turning on. I didn't want to spend over $400 either."
yes,yes,yes,"excellent, as is the description. Works perfectly."
no,yes,no,I am amending my review on this particular instrument. After using the phone for a week the camera light would not go off and the phone would not charge at all. A huge waste of money - the phone still doesnt work.

yes,yes,yes,"Best, beat I phone, 16MP Camera!!"
yes,yes,yes,"This model in particular simply does not reach 4G. Strangely, it only goes up to 3.5G. If you expect 4G performance, look for another model. Still, love Samsung products but had to return this one and had to order another model."
no,yes,yes,Perfect but it came with dual sim card which is not bad for me
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone to use on Straight Talk to replace my Google Nexus 4. I could only use it with the AT&T sim card on Straight Talk but would have preferred the Verizon sim card because of better coverage area. I really appreciate the expandable memory.

no,no,yes,"charger/data cable do not came in the box,just connector and earphones"
yes,no,yes,Soon after I bought this phone I noticed I wasn't getting 4G LTE as promised all I was getting was H+ or 3G.

yes,no,yes,"If I knew then what I know now I would have bought from my own carrier -UNLOCKED-. Since this is an International version, (sounds like that should be the best choice) well it is not.

no,yes,yes,"Bought this phone in Oct 2014 - at the time it didn't say it was from Korea. When it arrived the package had been open and an off-brand USA compatible adapter was placed instead of what I assume would have been a Korean wall adapter. Whatever, it worked so I didn't care."

yes,yes,yes,Excellent product.
yes,yes,yes,"I really like this phone, I think its even better than alot of the newer models because it has removable SD card option and this phone is quad core also.

yes,yes,yes,"The S5 is a great phone, but I felt like I was cheated for the simple fact that after less than 20 days Samsung annouced the S6. There could have been a warning or something like that to help customers. I am not happy at all for paying what I paid for an ""old smartphone"" ."
yes,yes,yes,"I love it , Thanks."
yes,yes,yes,"Just got my phone in yesterday. I'll update if I need to, but so far its great. Did the set up on the phone and works perfectly. I'm not a technologically inclined person, but its easy to use."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone other than when you take selfies.(with the front lens) Due to it having a larger screen and a wide lens it distorts selfies. If you like taking selfies I would not get this until Samsung offers a fix bc it makes me not want to take selfies.....
yes,yes,yes,Everything okey
yes,yes,yes,excellent. works great and battery amazing. can last me up to 3 days without charging
yes,yes,yes,"This is a brand new, in original packaging, unlocked phone. With the recent introduction of the S6, the price of the S5 has dropped. When buying such an unlocked phone in the USA, one needs to realise that this is a ""grey market"" phone, and although genuine and new in every way, one is highly..."

yes,yes,yes,The phone works fine but I have no coverage for places where everybody has signal besides I found only two languages although the quality of the phone is acceptable for the price
yes,yes,yes,It is to me much better than a blacberry that i had can do anything you want nice size and keyboard good for people with big fingers so you can type easy very clear if you talk to some one not that hollow sound
yes,yes,yes,"I choose my rating based on personal decision. Very impressed with the sharpness or brightness of the pictures and also, the compatibility of the device. Surely recommending the device to friends and so far, responses are very impressive"
yes,no,yes,I liked the Samsung galaxy s 5.. loved the finger print login.. there a lot of apps on this phone. I am still learning though. remote control for my TV... I can list a lot of things....

yes,yes,yes,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs."
yes,yes,yes,"Oh, Another year, another set of phones from manufacturers! I have been hooked onto get the latest phone every year syndrome and love reviewing specifics. Disclaimer, I love Android and have been using from very early days."
yes,yes,yes,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs."
yes,no,yes,"International version = Russian version . But I am going to use it in Russia, so, that's great!"
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my S5. It has met all of my expectations and then some. The display is great and the ease of use as well.
yes,yes,yes,"Oh, how I love my phone.. It is work well ..I have no problems. It is not to big and bulky..I am enjoying it."
no,no,yes,The phone was not compatible with the inexpensive networks available to me. Therefore I could not get a high speed internet connection.
no,no,yes,"buy cell and is not unlocked, asks me a code . what can you offer me? I already pay for an unlocked phone"
yes,yes,yes,"Bought a second one for my wife. In several ways better then the S6, easy battery switch out being paramount. Only one issue, international version lacks G4 capability."
no,no,no,batery doesen't las for the hole day. 4g doesen't work in Argentina.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is great except the description said that it works with carriers AT&T and t-Mobile. but it didn't really work for t-Mobile. Other than that great phone. New too :) love it
no,yes,yes,"Hi, I've recently purchased this phone for my mom. It's a great phone, BUT... Sometimes it just shutdown and she has to reattach the battery in order to turn it on. Also, battery charges about 8-10 hours. I will put 5* in advance hoping that customer support would be able to help me out."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent! Nicely packed. Product is from Abu Dhabi but as it says 'international' version, it is indeed. High speed internet works in it. Although I have still not validated if LTE (difficult to determine I guess) works."
yes,yes,yes,Just wonderful. What a nice camera.
yes,yes,yes,Perfect in every way !
yes,yes,yes,Excelente Producto
yes,yes,yes,Its a very good smartphone. The only problem was to receive it with all instructions in russian and asian languages. I was lucky that to change the language was the first icon.
yes,yes,yes,Excelente producto. .
yes,yes,yes,The phone works well
yes,yes,yes,I suppose it is the best mobile phones available nowadays on the market !
yes,yes,yes,the best S5 samsung phone...
yes,yes,yes,"Excelente servicio, enamorada de mi nuevo celular"
yes,yes,yes,It wasn't the same product I was looking for it has WiFi problem and some applications wouldn't run well I expected much better than this
yes,yes,yes,"This item is missing several features that the s4 has, it should have more features not less."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Slim & strong
yes,yes,yes,It is a good device. I recommend this device for all people especially international students who go back home.
yes,yes,yes,This is a very useful phone. Two lines working without problems. One line provides phone and data and The others one phone.
yes,yes,yes,"just superb. 128gb external card slot,16 mp camera, tons of features. phone is from middle east but my both sims usa and india are wkg perfect.. Samsung support chat is very helpful,they showed my how to tfr all datas from my iphone using smartswitch mobile application..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone, impressive camera, very responsive. The Dual SIM is a must if you are traveling or in need of different lines on your phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I have to preempt this review by stating that it is not about the Android operating system or the Samsung hardware, but rather about the usefulness of having a dual-SIM phone and how to use it."
no,yes,yes,I have used it for one week and I like most of its features (especially those subtle ones such as I can use the camera or change my sound setting even when the screen is locked) except the following ones for the time being.
no,no,no,I am using ATT service in USA and this phone doesn't support LTE network this is really very bad experience about this phone. I dont know about the Tmobile since I have not used/tried on it. While driving I was using GPS and since it doesn't support the LTE.
yes,yes,yes,"If you are provided two sims for work because of the unreliability of the available carriers then this is a good phone to have. I would have love to be able to access at least 3G on the second sim. Camera is great, both sims are actively on standby. Overall I love my Samsung S5 Duos."
no,no,yes,"Loved it! At each day I'm more Android, I'm even dropping my Apple Tv, it sucks! so limited!! No internet browsing, no Rdio, no Google Drive... c'mon Apple, get up!"
yes,yes,yes,"I moved from 1GB RAM to 2GB thinking it will help my choking configuration getting some air. Apparently (no) thanks to Samsung's endless additions to Android, it came with almost 1.5GB already in use... leaving too little for me and my apps..."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone. The camera is worth the price of tge phone if you are a filmmaker or photographer on the go. The mic can be set to directional, bi or omni and the additional lens kits available out there make the best deal in 4k digital photography today."
yes,yes,yes,To be honest it is a lot more complicated than I thought it would be. I am 82 and will be taking lessons soon. It holds a charge better than the Mexican phones. My Mexican SIM card works. The sound is so much better. Has a GPS! It has everything.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent. It was the only smart phone I could find that takes 2 SIM cards ideal for travelling between 2 countries. Lives up to expectation. Only criticism is the finger swipe - it doesn't work for me and I have to resort to password each time.
yes,yes,yes,So far I am enjoying using the phone. I liked the fact that it has dual SIM card plus it has SD card tray for additional storage . It beats the whole hazzle of removing SIMs if you travel to another country.
yes,yes,yes,nice smartphone...... works perfectly here in brazil. The best dual sim in the market.
yes,yes,yes,"Simply awesome I like it, but did not try the second chip yet...!!! But overall, the phone met my expectations."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. No problem with my international phone number. Highly recommended.
yes,yes,yes,Not many languages can be translated by this phone. It only provides 3G no 4G. The battery goes out very quick I need a spare when I travel
yes,no,yes,Nice proformance My mother has iPhone 6s I can compare this phone to 6s Fingerprint sensor are good Camera is perfect Blue colour looks very stylish
yes,yes,yes,"I ordered this for my mom. I wanted something that was bang for the bucks. Yes i ordered this in 2016 when it was no longer a flagship phone, but still at the price of sub 20 k INR it packs a lot of punch than the chinese ones."
yes,yes,yes,Wonderful specifications
yes,yes,yes,Exchange my Mobil 4gmobil i want please exchange this my mobile
yes,yes,yes,"For this phone ""OLD IS GOLD"""
yes,yes,yes,The first impression is that the colour of the handset is not the one showed in the internet. Don't recommend this to anyone. rds
no,yes,no,"Please don't buy any Samsung Smartphone Series. I faced lots of problem while using Samsung Galaxy Grand 19082GT. Automatically restart, Hanged, All applications won't work properly. I filed complaints in perherdar, all Indian consumer courts, I mailed to all shopping carts sites."
yes,no,yes,Download booster feature not present in g900h....s5 moreover its not 4g
yes,yes,yes,"Negative review for this excellent phone i think written by those who don't use it. I have i phone 6 and samsung galaxy s5 both. Nowhere except pal sticky feel s5 behind iphone 6, My place no 4g available i don't need it though for 30-32k price tag this phone justify its price 23k cheaper than i..."

yes,yes,yes,got cool one what I paid for
yes,yes,yes,Everything I wanted and more.
yes,yes,yes,"My first smart phone, so difficult to compare to others, but definitely it has exceeded my expectations. I had no idea that my old phone was SUCH an ANTIQUE by comparison. I was a bit gun shy about ordering something like this through someone other than my service provider."
yes,yes,yes,Perfect product!

yes,yes,yes,EXCELENT PRODUCT.
yes,yes,yes,This Galaxy S5 was purchased for my wife to replace her S4. The camera is better and it seems to be a much faster phone overall. I would certainly recommend this phone as we purchased an additional battery and large SD card for more storage.
yes,yes,yes,We bought this phone for our son and he could not be happier. I'm considering buying one for myself now.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent got the product in time and it met all of my expectations. Only did not get manual that's fine it can be down loaded.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I've ever had. I'd been a ill apprehensive about leaving the samsung relay because I'm very use to having the slide out Qwerty keyboard...but having just the touchscreen by itself is not as bad as I thought it would be.

yes,yes,yes,Phone is great and I love using it
no,no,no,Very bad because it is intenacional version
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product!
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this phone for my fiance for his birthday and it came in great condition, properly packed and everything works just fine. all the contents were in the box, we are using the phone in the Caribbean (Turks and Caicos islands) and it works just fine,"
yes,no,yes,The package arrived at a very fast rate and product look awesome but charger was kinda of British charger but no US charger.That's my only beef.

yes,yes,yes,I am very happy with my phone. Much better than paying 600 for a new s6.
yes,yes,yes,Love it. . it does exactly what I need.
no,yes,no,Turns out Samsung is just plain bad. The way it operates isn't near as customizable as I would like and there are extremely popular apps (like Clash of Clans) that aren't even compatible with this phone.
no,no,yes,Is defected doesn't read my sd cards
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with this product. I use it with Consumer Cellular and not had any problems.
no,no,no,"In summary section it states it will work with T-Mobile/Metro PCS. According to my phone carrier, Verizon phones DO NOT work with AT&T. T-Mobile/Metro PCS. $367 WASTED. I ended up selling it."
yes,yes,yes,Much nicer than my s3 mini. Works perfectly on ATT.
yes,yes,yes,"At the age of 65, this is my first smart phone. I'm still trying to figure it out, with a little help from my younger friends. So far, so good."

yes,yes,yes,Got the phone in 2 days! Loving it!!!
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone!!!! It was everything that was posted. I am in America and it defaults to Britain but I can't complain because I got such a good deal with the phone. It also came with the American adapter, so this phone is great, and couldn't have asked for a better deal."

no,yes,no,"First of all, I returned this Galaxy S5 because it came defective (display issues and charger not working properly), but I was able to try the S5 for a few days... I don't understand that the S5 has lag issues, I had performance issues while I was playing REAL RACING 3, frame rate dropping..."
yes,yes,yes,I was switching from an S4 to an S5. I have to say I'm very impressed!! Phone meets all my expectations. The camera is incredible. Browsing is fast & it seems to have a better Wi-Fi connection than the S4. I get coverage where the S4 does not.
yes,yes,yes,It appears that Samsung is trying to market to the fitness and outdoor crowd. The hardware is good with a screen that can be seen in sunlight and a body that is water and dust resistance; however as a new owner of the Galaxy S5 with a Gear Fit I am severely disappointed.
no,yes,yes,"very good the cell phone specifications, but de battery of de phone is very very bad..."
yes,yes,yes,"Yes, we were very pleased."
yes,yes,yes,great phone. Great quality.
yes,yes,yes,EXCELENTE CELULAR!!!!! :)

no,no,no,"I'm sure it's ok, just isn't compatible with Verizon and we didn't know it until we took it in to have service changed. No return as the seal on the box was broken just to find out it wasn't compatible."
yes,yes,yes,"Another Samsung, very similar to S4."
yes,yes,yes,Water resistant yes! Great pictures Yes! Largest screen in a thin phone yes! Get the unlocked version for service from almost any provider. I really want a HD dive camera that receives phone calls but they aren't in production.
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung is plastic, the quality of the phone is not good, and the phone sometime freeze, well anyway if you are samsung fan got for it"
yes,yes,yes,I moved to Norway and needed an unlocked phone. This phone worked with 2 different phone companies in Norway and was Brand new in a box.

yes,yes,yes,I bought samsung galaxy s5 before 3 weeks hoping it is a better phone (I had no insurance). They say it is completely water Resistance! After i completely closed and sealed the cover i tested to see if it is water proof. It looks like it passed the test because nothing happened.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone!!!! I love the waterproof thing as this was absolutely flooded last night and no issues at all (I've let it dry and voila!!!)
yes,yes,yes,"Delivery took longer than expected, but everything was ok."

yes,yes,yes,Excellent Product
yes,yes,yes,Great - using in India right now
yes,yes,yes,Sobrepasa las expectativas
yes,yes,yes,Very nice purchase...........
yes,yes,yes,I am really satisfied. The gold really stands out...
no,no,no,This phone is not a 4gLTE phone. The charger came with an adapter for US plugs. Ended up returning the phone for an unlocked 4gLTE sold by a different seller.
yes,yes,yes,Everything was as advertised. It came in good time as estimated and I love the product....this is definitely the place to shop!
yes,yes,yes,"I really like this phone. the picture quality is outstanding. I haven't had chance to use all the features. I took off 2 stars because several ""MAJOR"" flaws. 1st is the piece covering the charging port is very difficult to remove in order to plug in charger."
yes,yes,yes,"Nice Mobile Phone nice job Samsung but the fingerprint doesn't work you have to try 3 or 5 times to make it to work, Samsung has to improve that to compare with Apple, iPhone 5S is awesome, that's why I gave it 3 stars otherwise I would give it 5 stars"
yes,yes,yes,"I wanted an upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S3. Therefore I bought this phone. Once I received it, I WAS TOTALLY IN LOVE WITH IT! It's very well built and is simply an awesome phone."
yes,no,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S5 offers more of an evolutionary step forward in Samsung's S series smartphones than a revolutionary new phone. There are plenty of new features and advances with the S5 but those who already own a S4 likely will not be rushing to get the S5.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great! It works on the network in Jamaica and in the US with no problems. I'm really enjoying this phone!
yes,no,yes,The cellphone works properly. But it has problem with its cover. It doesn't seat correctly on all the places. There is a small space between the cover and the phone even when the cover it is in perfect conditions and also the phone. You can see it in the picture
no,yes,no,"I just bought this a month ago and now the display doesn't work, it has not suffered falls, or any damage. I will never again buy anything from this reseller."

yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I ever owned... I was weary because of the reviews but Im so glad I took the plunge it does everything I ever wanted and more. The gold looks amazing and sleek and the phone hasn't given me a single problem yet.
no,no,yes,"Selly deftly avoids acknowledging that this is the worthless 3G only version that has been around for a while, and not moving. If you are in America, avoid! We are on LTE whilst this 3G handset is in the stone ages."
yes,yes,yes,I love the look and feel of the phone. The front camera is splendid. The selfie camera shows a lot of detail as long as there's good lighting. The phone comes with a number of unique features most of which can be turned on or off so you can have a customized experience with the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"this cellphone is good, it seems like a new cellphone. I love it... it just a problem with the data mobile."
no,yes,no,Wanted an unlocked phone and was sent unlocked Verizon phone (very annoying) Came with all the veri za on built in Apps. Straight talk sim card did not work and had to get special SIM card so I returned phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Its a look alike of samsung galaxy s5 US version. Pros: Great look, responsive touch, Camera is awesome. Cons: Note that this phone does NOT have LTE. The phone looses battery pretty quick Does not ship with dual pin charger. Charger is Asian version and a convertor is shipped along with it."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, fast both in performance and in networking. Streams TV via it's cellular connection (T-Mobile) at 15 Mbs, which is plenty for watching Hockey live in HD. Performance is 5 starts all around! So, why not 5 stars? For me this is a little large."
no,no,yes,I'm having difficulty with the sound quality. I can hear okay but people I talk to said I sound like I am under water. It's really muffled. Got rid of the case but that didn't help.
no,no,no,"When I received these phones I was afraid because I specifically ordered them unlocked/international since my husband and I are living outside of the US currently and the boxes clearly stated on them ""For use with American SIM cards only""."
no,yes,no,"This was the worst mistake I have ever made. This phone did not meet up to my expectation. The network on the phone is terrible, but when I place my sim card on other phone, it works very well but when I place it on this phone, it does not work."
no,no,no,"I used to buy many Samsung stuffs but this phone disappointed me. This phone died in 4 months after an overnight charge. I thought I can at least get it fixed, but this phone warranty doesn't apply in US. So they couldn't fix it. I tried in India even they said the same thing."
no,yes,yes,"It is a piece of trash for me. I had issues with phone, contacted Samsung US, I was told it is a UK model. Contacted UK and they told they cannot ship outside of the country. Finally sold it back to Radio Shack"
yes,yes,yes,"Between me and my wife we have had a Galaxy S1, S2, S3 and now this S5. The S1, S2, S3 (which I am still using) were/are great! We liked them a lot and never had issues with them. The S5 has been a complete, total disaster. We bought this S5 from Vodefone in Italy with a two year warranty."
no,yes,no,"Bought my S5 8 months ago and its been running perfectly. However, a few days ago the screen started flickering; a greenish hue covering the bottom half of the screen when in the dark with lighting set to the lowest setting."
no,no,no,"It's was really made for the African countries but is it can also be used in Jamaica, America if it international unlocked it's I but heavier than G900F this made to work on any international mobile network if unlock. G900F is able to us the LTE service if that's what your aiming for"
no,yes,yes,"This is for someone else as a purchase. The screen is very nice and i did not play with it since it was not mine but the plastic case is something i found cheap on this phone. For the money you pay for it, you should get a metal case. My opinion."
yes,yes,yes,"Works fast, large screen, supports all sorts of applications, excellent camera - worked here in Turkey with Turkcell without any problems."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is amazing. I had the Galaxy S3 before from Verizon which was also a good phone. Got it from Verizon and used it for 2 years, no actual complains. The Galaxy S5 though is even better."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and great firm to deal with.
yes,yes,yes,"I got my product on time and in great working condition, all the features are working as expected (for now) and all in all I am well pleased with my product, I got exactly what I ordered as far as I can tell."
no,no,no,I bought a phone and was not unlocked.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent, fast, lightweight, has a good battery life, excellent camera, and the screen quality is awesome."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S 5 surpassed my expectations just love the features.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent, can recommend it"
yes,yes,yes,"excellent, very good, very responsible, the product quality is"
yes,yes,yes,This smartphone is truly fantastic. It does require some binary intuition on your part. So take some time to go trough the settings and you tube tutelage. Ounce you learn the settings this system becomes indispensable.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent product, it is fast smartphone, reliable and strong."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product!!!
no,yes,yes,"Every time I would unlock the device, menu key would start self activating, and reboots did not help it. It was as if someone invisible is continuously tapping the menu key, and the device would keep vibrating in my hand with each such press."
yes,yes,yes,Fine fine perfecto
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent, I have what they offered me, thanks"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. another master piece from Samsung.

no,yes,yes,The cellphone is ok...
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product!
yes,yes,yes,"Big, bold screen and terrific android platform. A significant step up from an iPhone 5! Very happy with the phone in every aspect. The camera is better than my very good digital SLR, the number of apps is amazing, and the android software is smooth and seemless!"
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone, very easy to use an, set up. Wish I had purchased it sooner. Didn't have any problem getting a provider for services. Love technology."
yes,yes,yes,"It is an excellent Smart Phone, much much better then I phones except the battery consumption is very high. inspite if that I think one should own this n enjoy the colorful display of each browse. Regards to the family if Samsung Galaxy, Mahendra N Jogani"
no,no,no,Didn't work at all and was obviously used.
yes,yes,yes,"Could not be more impressed with a smartphone. Love the size, graphics, processor speed and it just exceeded my expectations."

yes,yes,yes,Great phone and is unlocked- worked in the UK
yes,yes,yes,"Brought this phone without reading reviews. Tried to cancel the order, but somehow It too late after after 15 minutes had passed; strange. So the phone came none the less. The phone itself works great. It's new comes with everything (headphones, charger etc)."

no,no,no,"bad bad bad, i repair this cellphone twice"
no,yes,no,The phone has started to act up. Disappointing!!!!!!!!
no,no,no,This phone lasted less than 1 year and now the screen flickers and will not show unlock screen constantly now no matter what button you push the power or home screen button. I placed it in an otterbox the 1st day I took it out of the box to prevent any damage.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I do everything I need to with a great camera as well.
yes,yes,yes,I currently have a Samsung S5 and I love it. I needed an phone to travel outside the country and decided to buy another phone.
no,no,no,Did not received the right charger for this item....
yes,yes,yes,I am very pleased with what I've received
yes,yes,yes,Received very fast and works great
yes,yes,yes,very good easy to work with.
yes,yes,yes,I can not get this phone to put a call on hold i have tried every thing that the instructions said to do and it will not do what it is suppose to do. i would like to trade it in for one that works like it suppose to.
yes,yes,yes,Great Products.
no,yes,yes,Well for starters it keeps saying that the SD card has suddenly been removed then I shake it and it says preparing SD card. There's no on and off for the shutter sound on the camera and a couple other tech. glitched. Not satisfied at all
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone. Works fine, never runs out of memory nor lags."
yes,yes,yes,"This is durable, powerful and reliable phone. I got more than expected from this phone like power-point, word, excel. easy access to school work and programs anywhere you are. I am specifically recommending this phone for all student."

no,yes,yes,"Not Cricket compatible, apparently not really Universal."

yes,yes,yes,The best phone I ever have owned!!!
no,yes,no,"So glitchy please do not buy this phone, I need to restart it several times a day. Incredibly outdated and the phone camera is horrendous"
no,no,no,SPENT A small FORTUNE ON THIS PHONE. WORST PHONE EVER !!! Have returned it 4 times. GET THE WARRANTY! Back to a Windows phone and a Lumina k7 GREAT PHONES AT GREAT PRICES!!!
yes,yes,yes,the best phone on the market (2014)
yes,no,yes,"Everything as promised. There was an issue though. The wall charger that came with the phone, I believe it was an European version, I had to purchased an adapter. Other than that, can't complain!"
yes,yes,yes,"its just the best phone i ever had. the speed is incredible, the photos are perfect, and all the gadged it has are really nice"
yes,yes,yes,The galaxy S5 has met all my expectations. Some disappointment with the T-Mobile coverage.
yes,yes,yes,Very nice product although it came with UK conection Without adapter for American plug point.
yes,yes,yes,This phone works excellently no problems can take a drop great device. samsung has done a superb job on this phone
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is absolutely fantastic! Great for android photographers, great for android gamers, android filming... Anything that you can do on android, you can do on this plus more!"
yes,yes,yes,My phone is absolutely perfect
no,no,no,this a straight talk locked phone. it advertises being unlocked but when you buy the sim card starter kit it wil not recognize it because it is a straight talk phone. if you are buying it because its unlocked don't.
yes,yes,yes,I am very dissapointed because the speaker is damaged and the phone looks old because of that. Everything is fine with the phone works good but it doesnt look good cos the outside of the front speaker is damaged and looks like an old phone.
no,yes,yes,In the original offer page it quoted the provided LTE/4G frequencies. Combined with the t-mobile frequencies it was to supposed to match. Eventually it turned out that this version of the S5 does not even provide a connectivity for 4G internet.
no,no,yes,"Even though it has got bad reviews, seller was kind enough to put in a power adaptor since this phone is not from the American market, I believe african or european, comes in with a shiny ""nigerian guaranty"" sticker on the front of the box, meaning also that the box was openned and the phone and..."
no,yes,yes,"Everything about this phone was okay except for the fact that i got a micro USB instead of a 3.0 which charges a lot slower. At first I thought that was normal and that it came with a micro USB but you could buy a 3.0 for faster charging, but then I found out S5s are supposed to come with 3.0..."
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic.!! Very easy to use and has an excellent camera. I've never used before the camera of my phones because photos were of very poor quality, it's different now. The release device with fingerprint is great and S."
yes,yes,yes,I was dissatisfied to be honest. It is missing features such as download booster. 4g capabilities as I live in Europe. And it doesn't allow more than one device connected to the hotspot which is bizzare because everywhere online it says that the Samsung galaxy s 5 supports upto 8 devices on the...
yes,yes,yes,The charger supplied with the product is not the quality expected. Shame on the packer ..
no,no,no,I SEE U SEND ME A SAMSUNG GALAXY DUOS FROM WHAT I SEE U HAVE THIS IS NOT WHAT I ASK FOR THIS IS BAD I WANT BACK MY MONEY
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone!! The screen resolution is awesome and it's incredibly fast doing tasks! I recomend it to everyone!!
yes,yes,yes,"Truly international phone!! Works in India, South Korea (Seoul), and Hawaii (USA). Truly unlocked as well. I put my Vodafone SIM in this phone and it worked. The Vodafone SIM worked in India, S. Korea, and America. Next, I put in a T-Mobile SIM and that also worked equally well."
yes,yes,yes,So far I am really enjoying this phone. It's still a learning process (my first real smartphone) but it seems to be wonderful. I still have so much to learn about it's capacity - but I do enjoy having it with me to pull up info on products in stores and online.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent item, convenient and portable size and the screen is very sharp. It didn't present difficulties due to the upgrade from the previous Galaxy S2 to this S5."
no,no,no,The introduction describe that G900H support LTE but actually it cannot
yes,yes,yes,"Do not buy it. I have had this phone since september 2014. The phone can not be updated with the new firmware lollipop. It is Samsung original. My phone was made in Vietnam (original). Original Customized for UAE. But was changed the CSC. In other words the PDA, Modem, Country, etc..."
yes,yes,no,Bought this as a gift for the wife. Works ok but it gets so damn hot. Need to buy a protective case so you can still hold the phone. I hope Samsung comes up with firmware to cool it down.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent fast and safe equipment are brand new and unlocked
no,no,yes,Samsung America wont repair international version of S5. Be aware before buying it.
yes,yes,yes,"Thank You very much. Products were exactly as described. I needed a conversion ac plug for the charger, which luckily I had."
no,yes,no,"I'm writting because i just have like a month and half of normal using my galaxy s5, and it got damage by itself, the problem is that sometimes the display got blank and the cellphone make anything, it stay in this situation for some time, the only way to make that the s5 comeback to work normally..."
yes,no,yes,I received the g900h model as described (a real phone) and I've been loving it so far. Order came in earlier that I initially expected. The box felt really expensive to the point where I was skeptical about opening it. The screen is fantastic and the camera is just as good.
yes,yes,yes,Everything about this phone is great except for one huge fail; the 3.5mm jack doesn't hold a 3.5mm male plug. It is impossible to get any sound and the plug just falls out. What a disappointment!
no,no,no,"I treated this phone very well, used a case, never let it heat too much, etc. Just some months after the initial 1 year warranty the back case cracks for no reason and the touch screen simply stopped working."
yes,yes,yes,she loves the phone
no,yes,yes,"Unlocked and works as advertised. My unit came with a European charging block, which is useless in the States, but who doesn't have 10 or so of those lying around. It also did not come with the dual charge/data cable. Again not a deal breaker."
yes,no,yes,Does this phone work with metro pcs and Lyca mobile and T-Mobile and it will in Central America bcoz I travel sometimes and I want to make sure thanks
yes,yes,yes,"A very good phone and camera. It has enough storage space for high quality apps, music, and pictures if you regularly upload to the cloud. I wish the speakers were better quality but for the price and specs this is an excellent buy. Still a relevant phone in December 2015"
no,yes,yes,I gave this phone two stars instead of one because it actually still is functioning and didnt completely die after five months unlike the white version I bought for my wife. Crashes while trying to upload single pics to facebook and needs to be rebooted all the time.
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone, still better than the new Samsung, in terms of having waterproof and SD card support which is important for me. No the best looker though. Hopefully Android OS can improve performance of it's OS under heavy usage - But I still love the control it gives me"
yes,yes,yes,The phone is perfect and was delivered a week early
yes,yes,yes,A great phone. Be careful as it doesn't truly support 4g LTE speed. I used it when I traveled to several countries around the world including the Philippines. Worked with various sims that I used in it and always had decent call quality.
yes,yes,yes,It's a good product
no,no,no,Keyboard still defect even after replacement..
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent experience, I was so happy with this!"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, good price. Just what I was looking for."
no,yes,yes,Is not a factory unlock phone! !!
no,yes,no,I HATE THIS PRODUCT. THE SCREEN HAD A INK MARK IN IT HAD TO FIX IT AT MY OWN COST REQUESTED A REFUND AND I WAS TOLD I WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ONE.
yes,yes,yes,Very good product.
yes,yes,yes,Works great for my daughter in college! Samsung is a great product.
no,no,no,"Bought this in June and it died on me 7 months later for no reason. Was watching YouTube when the screen went black. Wouldn't boot past Samsung logo. Would freeze then try to reboot again. Tried wiping cache, factory reset, hard reset, etc but it didn't work."
no,no,no,Received 3G phone instead of 4G phone.
yes,yes,yes,excellent its my cellphone to used
yes,yes,yes,"The phone looked really good, like new. Everything worked fine except when you are on the phone the number dial pad does not work. If you are ask to enter an account number or something similar you are out of luck. Talk,texting and internet works great."
yes,yes,yes,I purchased it on behalf of someone and they like it very much. Way to go Samsung.
no,no,no,"DO NOT BUY!!! Worldwide Distrbitutors falsely advertises warranty coverage. Phone is not covered by any warranty if buyer lives outside of the United Kingdom. After 6 months, my display stopped working. I googled it, and it seems to be a common problem for Samsung Galaxy S5."
yes,yes,yes,Loved it. It was everything I wanted and more.
yes,yes,yes,Nice! Great cellohone
yes,yes,yes,Perfect! Love me New Phone it Woks perfectly here in Venezuela.
no,no,yes,"In the comments, it is mentioned that this product is G900F model that supports LTE and there is another comment saying it is he model is M900I. But the Title says its G900H. The product I received was G900H which is not LTE."
no,no,no,Either the cell phone or the charger has a problem. It is not charging. Again the wall charger is not a US standard. I am not totally happy with this product. I f possible I want to return back.
no,yes,yes,This is NIGERIAN!!! And has weird not usible charger
yes,yes,yes,"First off, I am not a professional reviewer, nor am I employed or compensated by Samsung or any other company. Instead of boring you with facts - which you can find anywhere on the Net - I will just give you some real-world impressions on how it looks, feels, and runs."
yes,yes,yes,The product was ok and arrives on time. Thank you.
yes,yes,yes,Shuts off within 30 seconds of everyphone call. Already back to my iphone 4s. Function of everything else was great.
yes,no,yes,People say if it doesnt say 4g lte then its a 3g phone better do their reseach! I have this same phone but its a SM-G900F INSTEAD off the H! My phone gets excellent 4g lte service n my phone doesnt say 4g lte it says hspda or hspda+ same as a 4g lte no difference! Thanks
yes,yes,yes,I hope samsumg galaxy 6 but it's 5 very nice Phone the market is good
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone. Relatively user friendly. I will test it further when I travel
no,yes,yes,It wouldn't stay connected to wifi or any cellular data.
yes,yes,yes,Value for money...but wait and get s6
yes,yes,yes,Excelente 100% Recomendado
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone but don't forget that it is not 4glte ...it is 3g phone
yes,yes,yes,Everything is excelente thanks so much
no,no,yes,Does this phone have finger print lock ??
yes,yes,yes,excellent product I loved.
yes,yes,yes,"After getting the s4 mini for my sister, my sister in law wanted to go for the s5, so we picked this one cas it is factory unlock inter vers. Works great, we didn't have a problem starting it up. The chip worked right away, and she likes the phone quality."
yes,yes,yes,extremely satisfied
yes,yes,yes,So far am satisfied. On time shipping and phone works great !
yes,yes,yes,Great love it works like a champion
yes,yes,yes,Is exactly what I was expecting. It works perfectly! I love it.
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone!!
yes,yes,yes,Just got my phone.... so far very happy....
no,yes,yes,"The battery goes down easily, less than 10 hours."
no,yes,no,Almost returned it but for the inconvenience. Can't imagine that a phone as new as this is not 4G compatible. This makes the speed slow. I am thinking of replacing it but this time I will research enough to make sure I get my monies worth. It is really a low point for Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,Very good international phone thank you
no,yes,no,This is the worst phone. The camera is adaquate but not very good for a 21 mp camera. It is easy to get blury pictures. The phone comes on in your pocket and then after a while one can feel the heat and realize it needs to be turned off.
no,no,no,I've had this product for about three months. The battery drains almost completely after a short phone call of 5 minutes. It takes about 8 hours to charge it about 20 percent. There are glitches and things don't seem to work right.
no,no,no,The phone keeps flickering and I NEVER used it yet. The screen flickers and I must admit I am very dissatisfied with the product
yes,yes,yes,"It's a very good phone, I'm not all that in to the whole new is better instead I want a good and reliable phone."
yes,yes,yes,Great Phone. I Love it. Working perfectly.
yes,yes,yes,"I like this product simply because it's a lot better than my last phone. Smooth running, no problems or issues, simply JUST RIGHT."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone
yes,yes,yes,"Great. Like new, only cover for charging port was missing.....I hope it doesn't malfunction now!"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great, it came on time, it came in a sealed package, never been pulled before, everything was brand new, i love my galaxy s5. i had my doubts buying on line as anyone would and i took a chance based on the comments i saw before and as a result im writing mine now."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had great luck with this phone so far! I was a little hesitant after learning that it uses 3G and not 4G. I primarily use wifi, but haven't had issues when using data either. I use this phone on the T-Mobile network; they were able to chop down my old standard SIM card to the microSIM size this..."
no,no,no,If I could give less than a star I would. What's the point of giving it a review if it doesn't work. I spent 500$ just like everyone else. 500$ does not com easy. Four months in the phone stops working. Dead.
no,yes,yes,It has far too many functions and with a 240 something page manual to try and figure them out. It is not by any means user friendly. The touch pad often doesn't respond or goes off somewhere else.
yes,yes,yes,I purchased 2 of these phones because the screen resolution is incredible and the brightness range is the best I've seen. I was upgrading from the Samsung S3 which has given good service for over 2 years but wanted the freedom of a no-contract phone.
yes,yes,yes,"el telf q compre no fue el enviado, me enviaron uno q no llega ni a sansun 1 ni sansun es"
yes,yes,yes,"It's almost perfect. The only flaw is that the S5 cable will not charge S4 and vice versa ! What is wrong with you techo guys at Samsung. With multiple phones in the house, its a ROYAL PAIN to check which cable is getting plugged into a particular phone. How can a standard be so non-standard ?"
yes,yes,yes,"..but this phone convince me that, at this point, Samsung overwhelm iPhone's devices. The water resistant feature is essential, for God sake we are in 2014 and still with phones that can't submerge in WATER? So, I love this phone."
no,no,no,my phone came and i couldn't use it due to it's inability to connect to the tmobile network even though it was said to be unlocked
no,no,yes,"While the phone is compatible as described with TMobile's network, be warned that the operating system will not have features found in the same phone sold by TMobile such as wi-fi calling, texting using wi-fi, and voice to text, visual voice mail, among other features."
yes,yes,yes,"Very good phone and got it for dirt cheap. It is awesome, from the look to the technology inside. No complaints, an excellent phone."
no,yes,yes,"For 'the next big thing' it's a piece of junk. We've had our Galaxy S5s for six months and here is the list of problems: 1. With only 14 apps on this phone, it constantly overheats. At least once a day. 2."
yes,yes,yes,"I got it in just 3 days and I the phone is just amazing. It's fast, smart, big, and reliable. Totally worth the $500!"
no,no,no,Since day one I've had trouble with receiving signal on my phone. I have t-mobile which the signal itself kind of sucks but with this phone I have almost one bar of signal and have to go outside or leave it still in order to get my messages or phone calls. Anyone else experiencing this problem?
yes,yes,yes,"this phone is absolutely amazing in every regard. Screen is awesome, big, resolution is great, tv and videos look phenomenal. The camera is the best i have ever had. The touchscreen is great. Battery is way better than all my past Iphones."
no,no,no,"I bought a Samsung Galaxy S5 for the christmas week of 2014 and the cellphone just turn off at the beginning of this month (April 2015) and it hasn't been able to turn on since that day. A 4 month cellphone that I spent almost $530 in, is not now working. Thank you! Worst spent money ever."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great but I'm not so please with the charger I got with it. The usb I got wasn't the genuine s5 USB, it didn't have the broader section where you plug into the phone. It was like an s4 USB."
yes,yes,yes,"phone works perfectly , very big screen , very slim .... but didnt get the real s5 cable...does not support 4g...."
no,yes,no,"It doesn't work. I took it to an Israeli mobile phone company, to the Samsung rep and to private store. All said it is not new and that it they are not willing to fix it. What is the procedure to return it for a full refund or replacement for a really new one?"
no,no,no,The phone seems to be having an issue. From the first day I received it its refusing to stay on. As soon as I turn it on it stays on for about 1 minute then turns off by itself and in order to turn it on again I have to keep removing the battery each time.
yes,yes,yes,"Pro 1. Well designed with curved edge 2. I like the white color 3. The large screen is very enjoyable 4. The in-bake apps are great Con 1. The price is comparably high compared to its specification 2. The home key is not round, thus it feels a bit weird"
yes,yes,yes,"I like everything about S5 but I wished they had copied some of the features from Apple (iPhone). I did have an iPhone for a long time but I didnt like all the restrictions (as if Apple still owned it, tho I paid full price for it and it was unlocked)."
no,no,no,Received Samsung Galaxy S5 on July 18 2014 after 100% charge the battery only lasted 5 hours at idle also constant warning Check Battery Cover when in fact the cover is secure. Samsung support refuses support since the IMEI number cannot be identified by Samsung Support.
yes,yes,yes,"Embarrassingly, here is the list of phones that I've owned (that I can remember): Samsung Galaxy s5 iPhone 5S Samsung Note 3 Samsung Galaxy s4 Blackberry Bold Blackberry Curve Nokia E6 Nokia X2 iPhone 3GS iPhone 3G Nokia 1100 And many more that I can't remember."
no,no,no,I just been using the phone for a few days and gets me crazy. I have updated the software. I fully restored. And keep failing. The touch screen sometimes didn't work. The earphone plug keep activated. And a lot problems. I'm from Venezuela. And it's hard to send back to usa.
no,no,yes,"As many people have mentioned, the international versions of Samsung's phones support LTE, BUT THEY DO NOT SUPPORT THE LTE BANDS FOUND IN THE USA! YOU WILL NOT GET LTE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH THIS PHONE! Though, in just about every other country, you will."
yes,no,yes,I love it so far but still testing. I seem to have a problem when I lay in the bed and talk but I think it might be the mute function on the phone when it goes in a face down position - so maybe there is not problem at all.
no,no,no,"I had to return the phone.. I kept getting a black screen and after being charged 100%, the battery is down to 80% within 10 minutes. I was really looking forward to owning this phone and felt sad that I had to return it."
no,yes,no,Will not get into technical details. Phone was sent to Turkey and it's been working fine. We didn't even use a US SIM Card and it still worked!
no,no,no,"bought this phone for my sister, it didn't work well. anytime she tried to do anything the phone screen would stop responding and go black. i thought it may have been a power issue and replaced the battery with the one from my S5 and the problems persisted."
no,yes,no,Neither Verizon nor Samsung will truly stand behind this phone! Do not believe the ad that says it is water RESISTANT for up to 3 ft for 30 minutes. Accidently dropped one in 1 inch of water for 2 seconds and it does not work.
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this for 3 weeks now, it definitively is one of the best phones i have used. Pros: Excelent battery life. Throughout a normal office day if you play 25 minutes, check email, use facebook and whatsapp using ""saving mode"" you'll get 12 hours without need of charge."
no,no,no,Very unhappy with this phone. The charging port stopped working within a few weeks of purchasing the phone. Sent it to Samsung for repairs and they charged me a good $100 to replace the charging port. This upset me more because i bought the phone as a gift for a friend based in South Africa.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone worked like a charm. Just had to make the first call (used it for 30 mins) using a US sim and then you're good to go. great camera, great display. GREAT Phone."
no,no,no,"Do not purchase this phone. The phone was never able to hold a charge for longer than an hour. When I contacted the supplier, this was their reply: We are sorry to hear the issue regarding your item. Since your phone is unlocked, there is no warranty included."
yes,yes,yes,"It's all they said it would be and more. Love the features, takes awesome pics for a phone camera. Very slim, and lady like. Some people say its big in size, but it is just perfect. Unlocked so you can select your own carrier."

yes,no,yes,"Well.... I'm nearly at my 1 year anniversary with my Note5, and I'm ready for a break up. I'm really jaded on Apple (as I think many people are), but I've now realized that Samsung is not the Messiah. The first problem was the tremendous slowdown."
yes,no,yes,"The phone works awesome for me so far, I got this last September. It came with the european charger and a converter. I think it came with head phones but i haven't looked in the box since the day it was delivered so i maybe wrong about that Haha."

yes,yes,yes,Great Phone works Fine 2 SIM well done Samsung...
no,no,no,"It worked great with AT&T prepaid but no LTE. And then it stopped working and the screen wouldn't turn on.... And I only bought this product less than 3 months ago. As for the Samsung product itself, the image is very clear and is one of the clearest smart phones in the world."
yes,yes,yes,I was very satisfied with my purchase

yes,yes,yes,Beautiful !!!! Works in Europe too
no,no,no,"I would have given it a 5 star, but i am giving it a 3. First because the settings to use data from whoever you choose as your cell phone carrier is complicated. I almost returned it thing the phone was faulty until i was worked through it. Secondly, the battery has little or no life."
yes,yes,yes,"I love everything about this phone. I works perfectly with Straight Talk. You just have to adjust the settings. The camera is amazing. The color is so pretty.

yes,yes,yes,"I’ve been able to climb the high ladder of success, somewhat blame this aide."
no,no,yes,"Hate it! Hate it! Hate it!!!!! What a stupid design! My galaxy S5 has enough useless features to fill days of exploration yet the home button wakes the phone and there's no way to disable this feature. Every time the phone is in my pocket, the home button inadvertently depresses and wake the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I am very happy with this phone. Sharp screen (vibrant almost) fast processor, easy to use and really good camera. The phone has been well thought out, in that its many and various aspects come together simply quickly and effectively. It is a very easy phone to get used to."

yes,yes,yes,I've had it for a few months now and it works amazing!

yes,yes,no,"had the phone for 2hours and its broken out of the box... update: phone works, battery that was shipped with phone was broken... after reading online , i purchased a second battery and the phone works fine. still annoying that it shipped with broken parts other than that, the phone itself is fine"
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone S5, great condition and worked fine but kept failing to apply tmobile update to version 6 marshmallow. Stuck on version 4. Vendor suggested i flash update which had mixed success. Deducted 2 stars for not supporting updates."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone! Works fast, clear pictures and font. No issues"
no,yes,yes,"The phone was great at first, but now it won't charge and I can't return it. I bought the phone at the end of December."

yes,yes,yes,Perfect price for a perfect item
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, I've had for almost a year and have had 0 issues."
yes,yes,yes,5 star rating already submitted to sender. Everything was as advertised. Product was still in original package including shrinkwrap.
yes,yes,yes,Works well. Had to re-calibrate the touch-screen sensors because it was all over the place. After that it worked fine.
no,yes,yes,Got it today will it's what you pay for but not to bad. One bad thing is I can see like a bunt mark like I see a time and date faded into the screen but it's what you pay for so far so good

yes,yes,yes,It was perfect for T-Mobile
yes,no,yes,"4 stars bc I was surprised and relieved that the description is acurate a couple scapes and scratches but nothing to significant, good phone but the battery seems to die a little to fast but nothing crazy, at least not yet had this phone for a month and it's still kickin'"
yes,yes,yes,Is not working good
no,no,no,This is a used phone and there is some problems with the speaker and the mic and at times people Say that can't hear me or I sound muffled . I will never purchase another used cell phone.
no,yes,yes,The phone arrived fast but theven phone itself was a nightmare! The back phone panel was broken on a rival. The plastic was very brittle and broke further when I put it on or would take it off. It reminded me of dryrot. Then the phone kept turning off and on.
yes,yes,yes,This works well for a thin case. Easy to get in and out of your pocket. I have dropped the phone a couple of times and so far so good. Don't expect a hard case though. You don't have to remove the case to charge the phone which is very nice. For the price I would but it again.
no,no,yes,Phone was used. Other than that I've had no issues. The phone came with 3 pictures taken from several years ago. False advertisement
yes,no,yes,Camera dosent Focus But Its Good Condition
no,yes,no,"Stay away! Junk!! Bought two phones. Black for me and white for my wife. Both developed problems within 2 months after the purchase. Screen began to flicker in the white one. Black one now has a dead speaker - all speakerphone functions, rings and alerts are no longer audible."

no,yes,no,"BUYER BEWARE OF USED CELL PHONES. After using this phone for 5 months, I just found out T-Mobile has blacklisted this phone due to unpaid balance by previous owner. I can't use this phone after paying $200 and wanted to return it since it is defective."
no,yes,yes,"Phone works and powers on. I just wish it would have been explained that there were extra steps to take to activate phone. In addition, the travel charger didn't work."
yes,yes,yes,It's a good product!
no,yes,no,"Thought these were new and after downloading an app to check the authenticity, it is a new phone . But the clear covers were messed with and the factory sticker was cut, so someone opened it. I read that customs may open these to verify it's not clones coming into the country."
yes,no,yes,Everything seems ok I was surprised by the different charging port and had to buy new charging usb cords.
yes,yes,yes,Works wonderful
no,no,no,The phone died today..Black screen..Hasn't even been 3 months since the original purchase..Curious to know if there is a purchase warranty on this device?

yes,yes,yes,Nice phone! Only problem is having to charge it through my laptop.

yes,yes,yes,Good working condition and deal.

no,yes,yes,Phone broke within a few days
yes,yes,yes,"This device was working great. But now the touch-screen has detached/unglued itself from the main body of the device. Would Samsung really make something like this for any market in world????? Our 1st S5 was purchased at a Tmobile store, which work flawlessly."

no,no,no,My phone will not charge and it came with a broken battery
no,no,no,"Only issue the usb wire sucks, but no problem with phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone. I get compliments on how clean it looks. Have had 0 issues since purchase. Thanks guys, for offering a great product at a fair price."
yes,yes,yes,Arrived in a good condition and it is working as expected.
yes,yes,yes,I am very happy with this phone. The one I got was new old stock and works as expected. I upgraded from a S3 to this S5. Because it is the best phone I could find with an easily changeable battery. In my line of work I often do not have access to outlets for recharging.
yes,yes,yes,worked well except it performs as if the battery is old and needs replacement.
yes,yes,yes,"With so many high end, expensive smart phones out there, this one might get over looked. While it may not keep up with the newest updates, it still has many of the features found on just released smart phones."
yes,yes,yes,Was exactly as expected.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought from SupremeDeals 18, this phone has been exactly as expected. Brand new, sealed in factory T-Mobile packaging. Works flawlessly, holds a charge decently. Will be purchasing another soon."
no,no,no,"I bought this phone in August and thought it was brand new. We received the phone and turned on the phone and the default language was Chinese. We wondered if it was a used one. Just three months later, the phone screen became loose and went totally blank. How disappointing..."
yes,yes,yes,I just wanna say thank's
yes,yes,yes,It was meeting the expectation.
no,no,no,"The worst phone i bought. Drop calls ll the time. Most calls go directly to voicemail, and the signal is so weak that most of the time doesn't connect to network."
yes,yes,yes,"Sent immediately, like new, great price, awesome product!"
yes,yes,yes,"They said a week to deliver, but came in to days! The phones come set and ready to Chinese... No setup screen as would be the case for a new phone so have some questions, but they looked new and in the box with only the quick setup manual."
yes,yes,yes,Arrived in excellent condition and functions well.
yes,yes,yes,Item as described.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. My last phone had tons of problems, and I finally decided to spend the money and get a decent phone. This phone is not super expensive since there are newer models out there, but it definitely does everything I need it to do."
no,no,no,Headphone jack acts up and you have to hold it a certain way in order for it to work
yes,yes,no,"My old Samsung Galaxy S5 fell and I broke my screen, after a failed DIY attempt to repair my phone I found it necessary to just buy a new one. I purchased this model because it was affordable, yet still had modern features I enjoyed. I received this phone packaged very well and in ""new"" condition."
no,yes,yes,This phone has been a pain in the but ever since I got it.I get one thing fixed on it and then I have something else annoying happen. I hate this phone
yes,yes,yes,"Phone was perfect. It was used yes, but to be honest I couldn't tell. Flawless. Instantly put it in a case and that's that. Fully updated and actually usin now to make this reveiw. Will update if I have any unforseen problems."
yes,yes,yes,Yes meet all expectations.
yes,yes,yes,Yes I love the fingerprint to unlock my phone. Just what I wanted.
yes,yes,yes,Great except aux port to stereo doesn't work. Tried with other phones with no issues. Plus Google maps after updates can't find gps. Though that might be the os.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone in every respect. After two months of use it is still performing exactly as as it should. I was already a T-Mobile customer, so this configuration was a perfect fit for me."
yes,no,yes,everything really good :)
yes,yes,yes,it wasnt the best
no,no,no,"Nothing the divice was difective. It has a burnt LED screen I can see the fliboard image burnt on the screen and the divine some times it flickers and interrupts my conversation. I kept it because I needed a phone asap, otherwise I would have retuned it."
yes,yes,yes,The phone functioned perfectly but there was a faint image burned onto the screen. I imagine it was a floor model that was always on.
no,no,no,"While phone was fully functional, the screen rotation doesn't work. I've tried multiple ways to fix it and it doesn't work."
no,no,no,Heated up next day screen blacked out
yes,yes,yes,Lititle laggy but still pleased
yes,yes,no,"Nice display and nice camera. I have trouble using the phone with one hand. Battery life is really bad. With decent usage, you may have to charge your phone 1-2 times a day."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone so much I plan on buying one for my husband.
no,yes,yes,"It works good, but for some reason the os spent a lot of my data and sometimes it freezes. So, it's alright."

yes,yes,yes,This is my second Samsung Galaxy. I think they are great phones. I like the swipe feature on the keyboard. The are very easy to use.

yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Truly is water resistant! I got it wet and freaked out. Posted it dry and it never missed a beat. I opened it up too be sure no moisture got in. It was dry as a bone.
no,no,no,Phone advertised as new qfter 2 weeks sound gone...couldn't talk except with speaker...apparently no t uncommon with this.Taken to local cell repair where it was doscovered it was used...pins and other parts missing. Took over 2 weeks to get refund. Just...don't!

yes,yes,yes,It's cool I never had a phone but this does what I needed to do so it's great
yes,yes,yes,"I won't go over any technical details here, there are far better resources for you to check out there for that. I'll simply state that Samsung phones are, by and large, great for updating their handsets and giving longer life to them."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung galaxy s5 is a smart phone that is light weight and is water proof as long as the back cover and the charger port are sealed tightly. I am very familiar with this device because I owned the galaxy s3 and needed to upgrade to a new phone so I chose the galaxy s5 to replace its place.
no,no,no,It was defective and sent back to factory.

no,no,no,I got one that was very used. Bad experience
no,no,no,Vary bad phone the the first thing is that it doesn't hold no charge you get like 30 minutes total on a full battery and also on the back sticker tag it says its a 32 gigabyte but on the inside of the phone when you look up the specs it says its a 16 gigabyte and when I tried to update it it said...

yes,yes,yes,i just got it and absolutly love it!! You can't tell it's used and it's a great phone
yes,yes,yes,"I get a new phone every few months but I always come back to Samsung. I have a love/hate relationship with Samsung. I can't stand their Android skin. Yes, it got a ton better with Lollipop, but there still some ways to go."

no,no,no,Had to return the product because it stopped working and wouldn't recognize the sim card after a few days.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought it used, and so far I've had no problems with it."

no,yes,yes,I had this phone for less than a year and had issues from day 1 with the receiver in the phone. Everyone I spoke to said it was difficult to understand me: either there was static or they echoed or I sounded muffled. I tried several online fixes and researched thoroughly to no avail.

no,yes,yes,"Got very quickly, love the phone After using this phone for awhile, I find that it's difficult to access the sd card, I tried rooting it, and found thru much research that the boot loader is locked and it's impossible to root. Also I can't use it as a hot spot. Also, it losses files."
yes,no,yes,Phone is working great.
yes,yes,yes,My husband purchased this phone and I got a Note 4. He loves his phone and likes the size better than mine. So I guess cell phones are still very personal! His phone works well and he has had no problem at all.

no,no,no,"Camera stopped working after 9 months. Samsung didn't want to repair the phone because I cannot provide receipt with IMEI number which I've never had. When I asked seller ""WIRELESS DEPOT"" to send me receipt with IMEI number, they just didn't respond. Thanks Andrey"

yes,yes,yes,The phone looked as if we re brand new; only exception is the small usb cover doesn't stay secure....I should be able to order a replacement cover quite easily
yes,yes,yes,"Yeah baby! Great for the price, safe arrival, received as promised!"
no,no,yes,The phone is indeed an unlocked phone and worked in the subcontinent. But the base of the charger malfunctioned after one charge. So i had to procure another charging base locally at extra price.
no,no,yes,so if im gonna pay 400 dollars i expect to get the item with everything working in my case the phone came with a broken headphone jack. be weary buyers
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone. Love it.
no,no,no,"The screen went black 13 months after purchase. I've tried different ways to bring it back to life, but it didn't help. Search results suggest it's known issue."

yes,yes,yes,In Ecuador it works perfectly!
yes,yes,yes,Arrived and works as advertised.
no,yes,yes,"I wanted an upgrade but this didn't work with my carrier. It was a fantastic price I have to admit, so many others sold this for twice as much. I am returning it only for that reason."

yes,no,yes,The Samsung Galaxy s5 is used I order for new

yes,yes,yes,"After a month of searching for a new phone. I had a hard time deciding between LG, Sony, and Samsung. It was more than I my budget, but considering the better camera and larger HD screen. Also comparing the higher re-sale and huge choice of accessories. Not to mention a lager selection of apps."
yes,yes,yes,Got this phone on here much cheaper than they wanted at AT&T. Took it in and they activated it and transfered my contacts with no problems at all. I absolutely love this phone.

yes,no,yes,It is great for everything but talking. My family refuses to talk to me because of the voice quality. We bought several of this same Samsung phone and the one I use has poor voice transmission. The other 2 phones we purchased have acceptable voice quality.
no,no,no,Battery didn't work. Needed to buy another. Then it worked
yes,yes,yes,"Brought this phone for my sister, we live in The Bahamas, and it is working great. Just placed the SIM card inside and it works with our cell phone company with no issues and good buy!"
no,yes,no,So far the product has been very good except for one problem. I found that the IR diode is bad so that it cannot be used for a TV remote control. This appears to be a defect in this particular unit. All the other functions work well that I have tested.
no,no,yes,I finally start using and checking the phone and today I found that the phone camera lens is cracked/scratched up after paying so much for the phone. I will add a photo when I take a picture of it. This was advertised and sold as a new item.
no,yes,yes,"The phone comes with the 5.0 Lollipop OS, of which the RETARDS at AT&T replaced the boot-loader. Meaning you can't downgrade to 4.4.2 which works a LOT better than 5.0, and you can't root the phone."
yes,yes,yes,Arrived in great condition and works perfectly!
yes,yes,yes,Was a gift for my husband and he loves it...was the best price offered!!!

yes,yes,yes,battery charging was not working but the phone was great
yes,yes,yes,daughter loved it
no,no,no,"I thought the phone was still locked when I received it. After a week of back and forth emails, I was asked who my carrier was, I had stated this in my first email. I again told them Verizon and I was told I need to go to Verizon."
yes,yes,yes,"I thougth my celphone was great when I got it, but I have been using it now for 4 months and it is not worht it, the battery lasts no more than 2 hrs, algo it keeps restarting over and over. Do not recommend it!! Now I know why it is cheap!"
yes,yes,yes,is an original or copy equipment ?
yes,no,yes,This is our third Samsung for family members. This is first unlocked phone. It was plug and play. Used sim from broken ATT cell phone. Changed out the SD card and set it up. Bammmm done deal. Easy peasy. I would definitely purchase another.
yes,yes,yes,"10/10 . Phone looks super nice . No box , but who cares. Would definitely buy again."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best smartphone I've ever owned. I am replacing a Nokia that was not a bad phone, but there were too many apps not available for the Windows system. Since this Samsung is an android, I no longer have that problem. I'm also thrilled with how easy it was to set up. So intuitive!"
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is great, but there is some kind of a short or something in the charger. The cord has to be set at an angle to get it to charge. Don;t know how to get ahold of seller for new cord."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone I love it
no,yes,yes,Charger only worked for two weeks

yes,no,yes,I use it with Straight talk and it was new out of the box. Enough said.
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect size phone for me. Opened the box, slid in my old ATT sim card and micro SD and viola, everything works perfectly. Highly recommend it."
yes,yes,yes,It last 2 week and the charging port broken not a good thing not a happy man
yes,yes,yes,"Thank you, thank you, thank you for finally exceeding my expectations over a phone, and thank you to seller for sending me exactly what I ordered, in pristine condition. This is my 10th Galaxy, in successive order, and by far the best in the lineup. First day, so far, so good."
yes,yes,yes,"The device itself deserves 5 stars. Really great shape, everything working perfectly, I was honestly surprised. The four star rating is because the charger that came with it is not compatible with it."
yes,yes,yes,"Im enjoying my new phone no problems so far, and it shipped fast"
no,yes,yes,"its ok came with 5.0 not 4.4.2 looks new but suspects it was used little things make me think it was, box and contents. att bloat ware is bad I knew that but 4.4.2 can root and remove 5.0 cant so I am stuck with it. but the phone works as a S5."
yes,yes,yes,It was a good purchase. Everything ok. Arrive faster and on time.
yes,no,yes,"Great phone. Definitely worth the buy. I ordered from Flip'd and he was very helpful and kind. Works with straight talk but if your phone is a Verizon unlocked phone, you can't use message+, you'll have to use the standard Samsung messaging to send MMS. No problems or complaints with this phone."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone for my wife to use on straight talk. Zero flaws. Period. Great device if you are looking for a great piece of equipment at a reasonable price.
no,yes,no,defective phone. I am not happy with product. I have tried everything possible. my phone calls always sound muffled. extremely frustrated to spend the money I did and not be able to be satisfied with product.
yes,no,yes,Smooth. Fast. Great screen. However the loud speaker quality it not very good. The person on the other side does not hear me during loud speaker calls.
no,no,no,"After using 4 months suddenly stopped working for calling, messaging."
yes,yes,yes,I just got my Samsung galaxy s5. I love Samsung products. This phone is bigger than I thought. Very easy to use and it take beautiful pictures
yes,yes,yes,"i got this and love it, best phone so far."
no,yes,no,"So I bought this cellphone to use in Argentina. I had a LG G2 Mini before, my 4G and 3G signal was great everywhere but the phone was too slow. I did a lot of research and found this S5 version was compatible with ALL 3G and 4G bands here, but it turns out that AT&T firmware doesn't let you connect..."
yes,yes,yes,The media volume does not get loud enough. People can't understand me when I'm using this phone. Sometime it don't ring.
yes,yes,yes,"Had AT&THE apps on it, I'm not with them"

no,yes,no,I am having problems with the volune during the calls. I can barely hear I acn not adjust or put up the volume. What can I do?

yes,yes,yes,I am happy with my phone and am learning to use it.
no,yes,no,over return date but phone has already been through 2 batteries and still doesn't work right. I don't think it was a new phone like they promised it was a mixture of parts from other phones (per ATT representatives) bought late November as a Christmas gift so only used from Dec 25th to 4/27 and...
no,yes,yes,Great looks everting works but the microphone ( I send it to someone for a present now have to get it back and exchange) you talk and people can’t ear you. That is the idea of a phone for you to talk to people.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone and it was as described..
yes,yes,yes,"I am loving my new phone. Meeting all my expectation so far. One fault I have thus far, it seem to like turning on by itself. I will turn it off and put it down and without doing anything except taking it up and it turns on. Otherwise it is great"
yes,yes,yes,My new phone has been great. Just would have been better with some kind of warranty.
yes,yes,yes,"Love it, love it, love it. Purchased this phone for use in Trinidad & Tobago. Good quality. Just as described."

no,yes,no,I've had bad luck with this product has already been used and it does not work well.
no,yes,no,At first this phone was good. But the call quality is horrible it's super choppy when speaking into the phone half of my words don't go through. Also battery is super hot and the cell seems to always open apps when it's in my pocket. Even when it's on standyby.
yes,no,no,"The cellphone was not what it was offered. I download the samsung phon info app and showed that it was charged 1530 times, and the headphones was plugged over 500 times. So This cellphone has been used many years, and it was offered as new ."
no,yes,no,earphone has problem
no,no,no,The product is not unlocked. Will return.
no,yes,no,"when i purchased this phone, the descriptions of it said it was new but after i had it for few weeks i realize that it wasn't new in different ways..

no,no,yes,said unlocked but its AT&T
yes,yes,yes,Happy with the phone so far
yes,yes,yes,"great phone , I take it everywhere."
no,no,no,"Cell phone stopped working after a month. Too bad that it was out of the country. It was taken to a repair place and was fixed, but again, it lasted only 4 more months and needed to go back to the repair shop again. This time, it was the battery not keeping power. The repair place fix it again."
no,no,no,"Total Garbage!!! Corrupted my memory card and I lost 15000 pictures, as well as other important information. if I could give this a negative score I would. Easily in the top 5 WORST purchases I've EVER made."
yes,yes,yes,This is my husband's very first smart phone and it does everything he was hoping it would. He only hopes that he is smart enough to get the full use out of it.
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone and brand new ... not sure if it is actually rooted. The unlock code on the packaging works really well after inserting a non t-mobile SIM!
no,yes,no,I needed a replacement phone SO badly. Brought it all the way into the T Mobile store and it was defective.
yes,yes,no,"Brand new phone but It doesn't have the language pack that I want (Vietnamese). I bought it for my Mom so w/o it, she can't use. This is definitely an AT & T phone, not an international version. Be careful. I might have to return it."
yes,yes,yes,very good buy!! thanks!!
no,yes,no,"Awful and expensive experience. Slow camera, phone never worked right and blanked out after 1 year. Samsung tech guy looked at phone and told me it was not a new phone that seller stated it was."
no,yes,no,very bad like China phone
yes,yes,yes,Charge port gave out relatively quickly
no,no,no,Went bad within the first month. Screen would go black for minutes at the time.
no,no,no,"I have had a very bad experience with this product. After only 2-3 months of buying it, the charger stopped working! I had to replace the charger myself. Then in about 4 months, the screen started to separate from the phone. it was really weird, as I never dropped the phone or anything."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my husband's absolute favorite phone. Big screen big not as large as the note... more pocket friendly. Great graphics, functions well. Android. Coming from using a Galaxy Note, I kind of expected this to be an easy phone for me to use."
no,yes,no,"This has been the worst phone. The camera takes terrible photos, it will often eat my texts so I never know that someone tried to get a hold of me. It sometimes does not show that a call is coming in nor will it give me a notification that I missed the call, and sometimes it won't let me know i have..."
no,yes,no,Did not work with tmobile lte as expected
no,no,no,I bought the phone unlocked but it was locked by AT&T.
no,no,no,"the charger does not work, it looks new but does not work"
yes,yes,yes,Item was as described no problem and bought this a few months ago and wanted to wait to write a review to make sure it would last and do what it said it was suppose to due. Thanks so much and for the headphones and international charger.

yes,yes,yes,"Afterall its a Samsung, it works great"
yes,yes,yes,Great powerful and high performance cellphone.
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone, Exellent service."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is supposed to be new, but doesn't look new at all! The box has cut on it and was not sealed, the protection sheet has bubbles underneath, the battery has dirt mark on it! I just started using it so I don't know how well this phone works, but so far so disappointed!"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone I bought was originally an AT&T phone and does not have full compatibility with T-mobile, nor can it be modified. Didn't know the actual phone was different for different carrier until it was too late."
no,yes,yes,came in a new package but the phone wasn't...screen scrambled on its own after 2weeks kept shutting off and turning itself on the charger port door just fell off not happy with this phone at all...
yes,yes,yes,Works great but the back cover is thin. The rubber seal came out of the charging jack cover about a month after I started using. But phone performs fine. I did have four messages that were received by two different people in Japanese.
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good... works well... Except: I hate the built-in ATT apps and features. I don't have, nor use, ATT, it should not be on the phone. And it is a pain in the ""you know where"" to disable or delete ATT from this S5."
yes,yes,yes,"Came new, works like a charm! Great product! If I ever need another phone I'll be back!"
yes,yes,yes,Works perfectly. Good choice.l
yes,yes,yes,Great phone... had at&t software but all good.
yes,yes,yes,Received an AT&T branded unlocked phone. The software is lacking features like a mobile data toggle in the quickpanel. It also comes with AT&T bloatware on top of the Samsung bloatware. I'd recommend to anyone to put the extra money and get the G900F if it has the necessary bands you're looking for
no,yes,no,"Just got my galaxy s5 in the mail today. Thinking that the phones has been out for some time now, you would figure that all of the kinks have been worked out. But, like everyone else, I have these dark lines across my phone. I've done the factory reset and it actually made it worse."
yes,no,yes,"I don't like that is not the same kind of charger, and my storage space on device sends to run out fast, and having problems getting it on memory card"
no,yes,no,"Worked for only 2 days then screen went all static got a new one and the same thing happened thinking it was a new unit or the ""problem was fixed"""
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect, a great phone, thanks!!!"
no,yes,no,"The phone I bought has a problem to charge. I though the problem was with the charger only, but when I tried to buy another one none worked. I work in a cruise ship so it took more than a month for me to receive the phone and I didn't have time to go outside and try to buy a new charger before the..."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy's phones are the best Android phones. Bought it as a gift for a cousin, she's very happy and have been using, photo quality is good."
yes,yes,yes,"The microphone doesn't work well in speaker mode. Most likely because of the waterproof feature, because the other galaxy models are good."
no,no,yes,"The phone itself is great. Overall very happy with the Galaxy S5. Unfortunately the phone was NOT unlocked as advertised (which was my primary reason for looking for a new phone). Greatly disappointed that the product listing states right in it that it's an ""Unlocked Cellphone"" and it wasn't at all."
no,yes,yes,"BE CAREFUL! This is a AT&T phone only SIM unlocked, it has all the AT&T apps and files that you can' t use neither delete and takes about half of the memory, Beside that it has an Android Lillipop version THAT CAN'T BE UPDATED if you are not AT&T user and use the phone in USA."
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with this phone. Have T-Mobile and no problems with service. Just resized SIM card, from old phone, per template found online."
yes,yes,yes,"I like the phone, but I am a little disappointed in the signal strength."
no,no,yes,"Phone came in great condition, but it isnt unlocked. I tried connecting to Metro, but it said the phone ""doesnt support this type of SIM"" which is RIDICULOUS. I wasted $264 on this phone, just so it cant connect. Complete bs."
no,yes,no,"Unbeatable price, but, when I use speaker phone, the other person on the line hears terrible static. This must be a hardware issue."
yes,yes,yes,"Looked brand new, works great, a tiny bit slow but not a problem considering its not brand new. Came in its box with charger. Came in when said and so far works like a charm."
yes,yes,yes,"Based on what my friend said. He is very pleased. The package arrived as how you guys planned it. The contents were in proper working order. The sellers definitely made up for what took place the previous time. So, all in all, i was very pleased and so was he."
no,no,no,it is the worst phone I ever bought in my life.
yes,yes,yes,yes it did. Thanks
yes,yes,yes,Got my phone very fast it is very much what I wanted
yes,yes,yes,I got a lot more than what I expected usually had my doubts about ordering online or through mail I always think I'm going to get less than what I'm paying form but actually I got more then expect it love it money well spent
no,yes,no,"I recibed the phone in very good conditions. after three months the screen doesnt work good, so I bring the phone to Samsung techinical repair and they inmediatly return me the phone back because the phone is not Samsung brand."
yes,yes,yes,Excelente como nuevo
no,no,no,"I bought this phone a,few months ago. It keeps shutting down constantly. I had cheaper phones with you current plan and the had much better reception. Cannot use on speakerphone because no one can understand me. I certainly do not recommend it."
no,no,no,"I bought the phone unlocked to use on the T-Mobile network. It turns out it was originally an ATT phone. Unlike some phones with the same designation (Galaxy S5), this one has a home key in the center at the bottom that is actually a button, It functions as an additional on-button (it won't work to..."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone no problems so far
no,no,yes,"The phone was great...for 3 WEEKS. Now, it refuses to charge or hold the charge. There are times where it will decrease charging while charging. I've tried everything to fix it. My friend bought the same product at the same time and it is already deteriorating. I guess that you get what you pay for."
yes,yes,yes,No phone like a Samsung! Beats the heck out of my old iPhome!
no,no,no,My phone cam with a battery overhesting problem and display gamma problem
no,no,no,"Just from being carried in my purse, the back cover broke in 9 places over the course of two months."

yes,yes,yes,I was very satisfied with my purchase! My galaxy s5 phone was in great shape!
no,no,no,Had this for 3 months now and it is constantly freezing battery doesn't want to charge anymore very unsatisfied
no,no,no,"In the description of the phone said it came unlocked, one of the reasons why buy it however did not come unlocked and pay 20 dollars for doing unlock, as otherwise fine"
yes,yes,yes,I received it in excellent condition
yes,yes,yes,My girl loves it. Great phone.

yes,yes,yes,I purchased this phone for my niece who needed to use overseas. So far she has no problems with it and loves it.
no,yes,no,Beware!!! This Samsung Galasxy S5 has high pitch noise in video recording. Seller promises to check before sending replacement. The Replaced Samsung S5 crashes a lot with high pitching problem persists. I mispalced my trust. Very dissapointing!!!
yes,yes,yes,"good fone, excelent battery"
no,yes,no,The fact that it is AT&T based makes me hate them. The service is absolutely horrible here. Had I known they were I would have never bought them. If they were free I probably would not want them.
yes,no,yes,"The S5......international.....we (my wife and I) have one each that replaced our S-3, International. Like the idea we can do many more things with this S5 than the S3. Also, like the fact we can do more for ourselves than having either the S6 or S7."
no,yes,no,Beware of this phone. After about 4 months of normal use the Samsung battery swelled up and pressed against the body of the phone with such force the screen glass has lifted away from the frame of the phone.
yes,no,yes,"I chose the S5 because it is the last model with a replaceable battery, and has all of the same features as the newer model. Making it wireless charging is simple and cheap."
yes,yes,yes,I was Leary at first but when i got it a brand new sealed by factory box never opened BRAND NEW PHONE!!!! I was ecstatic.Would highly recomend!!!
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with it !!
yes,yes,yes,Like new nice phone
no,yes,yes,The cellphone box was empty.
no,no,no,"When I first got the phone, it wouldn't work. I thought that the phone was completely nonfunctional but tried it again. It turns out that the battery was completely depleted. It seems to work alright now."

yes,yes,yes,"No problems,so far.I'm happy with the phone"
yes,no,yes,"I was afraid to buy this phone. But I got it and is excellent. It's new with everything original in the box, headphone, charging. Good price..."
yes,yes,yes,Perfect came on time with all the necessary stuff in it.
yes,yes,yes,"Was very satisfied, the phone was just as I was told it would be, I'm very happy with it, I would buy again from this company!"
yes,yes,yes,Better that i expected
yes,yes,yes,Very good look new and work 100%
no,yes,yes,When I opened the phone I was not able to access any screen except the WIFI screen. I tried everything suggested on the internet. Finally I took my phone to a cell repair store in downtown. It cost me 30 minutes and $25 to correct the problem. The phone works fine so far but I am not a happy camper.
no,yes,no,"I have had nothing but problems with this phone. It says it was new and unlocked, but I am wondering if it was actually defective but sold as new and with no problems. The first phone I got from this company I had for about 33 days (just over the warranty) and I woke up one morning and had no..."
yes,yes,yes,The Phonew is nice. Very nice and sensitive touch screen. I thought however that it hadoesn't more storage space. Memory storage was full.in the first month I got the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Love it . works perfectly, no faults ..."
yes,yes,yes,it is a great phone to have
yes,yes,yes,I am satisfied with my phone.
yes,yes,yes,Very nice phone for the money. Works as expected.
no,yes,yes,"very disappointing...to pay so much for a phone that works a little over 30 days and then gives me the ""black screen of death"", and cannot be used. hopefully i can get it to work again but so far nothing."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone! I didn't want to spend a lot of money on replacing my Samsung Galaxy 3. I had to replace 2 phones at the same time and that can be expensive. We found the Galaxy S5 at a great price! This phone is amazing!
yes,yes,yes,"Bought it on here because it is much cheaper to but a used S5 than a new S6 or 7. The phone isn't on the scale with the newer phones, but if you're looking for a smart phone with a good camera and is reliable, this is a good phone for the price."
no,yes,yes,Its all good except i cant turn off my data usage. Even if its turned off I still can go online
yes,no,yes,Android 6.0 Marshmallow update not appear after several days of use. AT&T applications and dependeces for updating.
yes,yes,yes,"f-ing great. Delivered right away, and exactly what I ordered. Perfect"
no,no,no,"This phone is defective and somehow changed , as Samsung repaired it for me and told me that it was altered the person that sells this should not sell anymore. The camera is still not working right"
no,yes,yes,"The mint part stained black/greyish in less than 2 weeks and is impossible to clean! I was disappointed. If you don't care about cleanliness, then go ahead and buy."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, came in time, barely any scratches"
yes,yes,yes,Exactly what it claims to be.
yes,yes,yes,I've had my phone for 6 months now and there hasn't been any issue. It's worked perfectly and was super easy to get service from AT&T with. I'm so grateful this was an option for me.
yes,yes,yes,Original honest review won't post. Long story short. Do not buy this phone. It's definitely not a new one as advertised.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone love it. Good battery life
yes,yes,yes,Prompt shipment good product.
yes,yes,yes,worked as described. Very nice. Great price.
yes,no,no,"I bought this for the camera quality, which is exceptional. I have no complaints and have experienced no disappointments. Too bad Samsung doesn't keep producing it, meaning you can only get it from other vendors."
no,no,no,This is not an unlocked phone.....come with all kinds of bloat ware from AT&T and you can'T share your WiFi connection like I could with my last unlocked phone. Also I had to search for the right codes online to get the phone to work on Straightalk.
yes,no,yes,"I thought this phone would be a upgrade from my Samsung Galaxy S4, but I was wrong. This phone was advertised as new, but I dont think it is. I think its hardware has been monkeyed with and cheaper components installed."
no,yes,no,Phone is overheating a lot. Have to turn it off to cool down.
yes,yes,yes,"Wish I would have purchased this phone earlier. Love it. Easy to use, and so much better than my old phone. Very good service."
yes,yes,yes,Great deal on a really good phone.
no,no,no,The screen started flickering in 30 seconds after every time I turn on and the battery dies in 2 hrs
yes,yes,yes,after years of my friends telling me to buy a Galaxy i finally did .loved it on sight !beautiful sleek desigh felt realy good in my hands no stretch to access keyboard or apps good resolution on both camera .all i was looking for in a phone But no one can here me when i speak i have to put them on...
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent choice for a travel phone. We love that it has the option to add a micro SD card for additional storage space. Unfortunately this phone broke on our recent travels (freak accident with a taxi door); however, since we had all of our photos backed up on the SD card, we don't have to worry..."
no,yes,yes,Don't believe it's international because it's not. It's AT&T which means you would see no software updates ever unless your line is AT&T.
yes,yes,yes,"It comes with all accessories, but not the mobile phone."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone and I'm happy I got it, but there are a few things I don't like. The battery life is atrocious, I consisently get notified that the back cover isn't on all the way when I know it is, and it overheats pretty quickly if you don't close out of your apps regularly."
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone. Had purchased an android for Christmas from Trafford and was a big disappointment. Battery barely lasted one day. Decided to ""bring my own phone"" and purchased this due to good ratings. VERY satisfied."
yes,yes,yes,"Packaging, delivery and product were great. The phone is the same as the one you get in retail and has the same pros and cons as any Samsung Galaxy S5 reviews will tell you. BEWARE of the cellphone company and 4G compatibility though, particularly if you travel internationally."
yes,yes,yes,Hey I perched this phone for a friend of mine and she was not disappointed with it thanks guys.
yes,yes,yes,This one is mine.......had previously purchased one for my wife to replace her S3 international ..... I like what I saw and broke down and bought one for myself to replace my S3-International. We keep our S3's available for backup or taking trips. Thank You. Ron
yes,yes,yes,I bought this as my very first cell phone. I am still learning how to use all of its features. So far it has proved easy to use.
yes,no,yes,Device is unlocked but still loaded with at&t bloatware.
yes,yes,yes,Good in every way but battrey drains fast
yes,no,yes,Phone was NOT as advertised. It is NOT the Inernational Version. It is a bloatware clogged AT&T disaster.
no,no,no,THIS DOESN'T WORK WITH STRAIGHT TALK
yes,yes,yes,The phone was awsome! My wife loves it!
no,yes,no,its ok it took forever to get it working with strength talk
no,no,no,the screen is broken
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone. I didn't expect it to be so perfect. It has a few signs of usage but you could use a phone cover for that. I am really satisfied with the order. I recommended it to my roommate and she also got hers from here.
no,no,no,"I am returning this phone -- the audio is faulty, both incoming and outgoing calls."
no,no,no,The speaker is defective
yes,yes,yes,"Met all expectations, packaging and phone were great and had all its accesories"
yes,yes,yes,This phone did everything I wanted it to do and more so far I've had no trouble with it and no problems. It toke a little time to figure out how it worked and use.
no,yes,no,The S5 wants you to be safe. It has this horrible feature called car mode. When in this mode it will reject calls and texts so you will not be distracted while driving. Car Mode activates any time this phone is paired with any Bluetooth divice.
no,no,no,I couldn't make calls with this phone but I was able to receive calls and other android features seemed to be fine. I used lycamobile SIM card. Initially I thought it could be a problem with SIM card or network but then I tested it on a different phone and there was no issue with SIM card or...
no,no,no,The phone was not new. I took a picture and it turned out so bad. That's when I noticed that the screen on the camera was completely scratched up. I use the phone camera all the time for work and now I can't take pictures that are not all foggy because of the scratched camera lens.
yes,yes,yes,excellent like new contition
no,yes,yes,"I was thrilled to receive this phone at what I thought to be a GREAT price. However, after several months, I have begun to experience audio difficulties when placing and receiving incoming calls. I have gone to the web to find remedies. Nothing seems to give me more that temporary relief."
no,yes,no,I changed my mind! I am not happy with this phone. It is extremely hard for people to hear me on the phone and I am unable to recieve pictures and multimedia messages.
yes,yes,yes,Androids rock!!!!!!! Look no further this is the best phone
no,no,no,S5 detects headset but there is no audio. Poor quality test. Found no other issues so far.
no,yes,no,The phone has no built-in flashlight and the cover started falling apart the first day I received it and it doesn't even fit tightly on to the phone. Want my money back wouldn't recommend this to anyone
yes,yes,yes,"Everything as advertised and more. Large screen, fast operation, great camera."
no,yes,yes,Worked great for about 2 months then slowly things went wrong. really sad! I have it in a waterproof case and take care of it diligently but still no luck getting it to work right.
yes,yes,yes,Works like a charm
no,no,no,Phone was faulty. Wifi issues. Had to send it back
no,no,no,The Samsung Galaxy S 5 is not working wild to return it back
yes,yes,yes,"This phone worked beautifully right out of the box for me. I love the Android operating system - much better than Apple, in my opinion - and this phone has some great features. The screen is bright, crisp and big enough to be able to use it as a navigation system in my car or to view videos."
no,yes,yes,send back camera was not good
yes,yes,yes,Everything ok thanks
no,no,no,The worst phone ever
no,no,no,Just received the phone today amd it wont even start up. Very disappointed. I will be returning this.
no,no,no,"Don't buy the cellphone from this company! WHen they sold it, they have already used 11 months of the 12 months of warranty Samsung provides. They don't prevent you of that. I discovered it when I had issues with my cellphone. Wrote to them, but never got an answer"
yes,no,yes,Although I checked compatability before buying this phone it does not work well for straight talk. It was a no contract phone but associated with AT&T. but nothing through ATT works like blue tooth for instance. unless I pay for it.
no,yes,yes,It's an AT&T phone ! Funny how they didn't mention it .
no,no,no,The phone my daughter purchased said it was an unlocked phone and we got it locked...doesn't work and its of no use to her..rip off..
no,no,no,The phone is okay but the battery life is horrible. I played candy crush for 20mins the battery went from 90% to 60% . I have to charge the phone twice a day. Now I have to spent extra money to replace the battery.
no,no,no,The phone Not working properly it has some problam.
no,yes,no,"I had a several trouble with this phone .. Really bad dream.. It's freeze all the time , when we use inmidiAtly putting warn.. Sound emergency alarm etc.. The screen put dark with line in the middle . I get off in use.. I'm so disappoint .."
yes,yes,yes,Fantatstic phone in every way. Came new. Hold charge and is super easy to use. Would highly recommend this cell phone. A real bargain for $ 273.00.
yes,yes,yes,My mom loves it and it works great
no,no,no,The phone was stated that it was new but it was accually used. One month after I bought it the charging port started to go bad and by the second month the port no longer charges. So I have to charge my battery by using an external charger.
no,yes,no,This Phone worked well in the being and after 6months it started acting up you can not hear the person when making or getting calls you get a lot of missed calls and there is no kids mode on this one not like the first one I got sprint of tmoble.
no,yes,no,Wouldn't charge; had to return.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone and works wonderfully!
no,no,yes,"It seems that the Cellphone was used because it was dirty by inside, comes in the original box but without earset and without start guide, the home button seems very weak, this makes me wonder if it is original. At least it works."
yes,yes,yes,I have been using this phone for over 6 months now. I really love this phone but the only complain is the battery life. I have to leave it on charging every night or the phone gets drained completely by morning even if it is charged 100% before I go to bed.
yes,yes,yes,Bought for my friend he loves it
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, Samsung makes good phones for the price can't beat that"
yes,yes,yes,"This is a wonderful phone with lots of storage, a large screen, and high quality."
yes,yes,yes,"Item arrived as described and works well, however the battery was not new even though it came packaged like it was new. I had to replace the battery because it wouldn't last more than like 4 hours a day. Other than that it is a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,Very pleased with the condition and quality it looked like a brand new phone. My son took to the T-Mobile store and got it activated with no problems. The only issue is he is not able to talk or text on wifi.
yes,yes,yes,Enjoying the phone
no,yes,no,Nice phone. Minor scuff on front even though supposed to be new. Upon trying to make a call microphone won't work so no one can hear me.
no,yes,yes,Unfortunately this phone is a disappointment. It won't charge unless it is sitting.in the perfect position and I have even bought several different chargers. Also it is very slow
yes,yes,yes,No problem to report at this point. Brought as a gift and my lady loves it! I will keep my fingers crossed because it has only been a month. Will keep you posted.
no,no,no,"Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the battery became defective with only 2 months of use, and it was an original samsung battery. Would not turn on and when it did, it would shut itself off. Thought the unit was bad but when I purchased a new battery the problem went away."
yes,yes,yes,The only negative thing is with he phone and not Good Guys the negative thing is at full volume (and it is turned up to full volume when talking) it isn't loud enough for me. I have a friend who has the same Galaxy S5 G900A and I can hear on his just fine.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone,you will not be disappointed with this phone. Just make sure you use a trustworthy seller this one was purchased from Breed, which is my second phone from them."
yes,yes,yes,It going great so far no problem at all
yes,yes,yes,Love my phone...but one week later had to put it in the shop my charging compartment stop working.
no,no,no,The phone stopped working for no reasonwith a few months of use
no,no,no,I bought a samsung galaxy S5 but only receipted the box of it and inside there was a BLU phone. I do not know if it is common to happend. The problem is that I bought to bring abroad and need to pay something to send it back. It is a very bad experience.
no,no,no,the connection to the PC didn't work. Had to return and pay for the shipping?
no,no,yes,Camera only takes blurry photos.
no,no,yes,I bought this Phone Last december and it came Withe a noise in the speaker algo it appears a vertical Green líne on it Last monday Pls advise
yes,yes,yes,We actually bought 2 of these phones. One for me (which I love) and one for my husband who thinks it is okay. He also had a flip phone before and he says this one is way heavier. He will get used to it though. His came exactly as advertised as well. NEW and in the original box.
no,no,no,They are describing this phone as an unlocked phone...it is not unlocked!!!! Be ware!!! Do not buy!!!!!
no,no,no,"Had this phone not even 6 months and now it won't take a charge , massive problem returning it so waste of money"
yes,yes,yes,"Everything we expected, works like a charm, would purchase again."
no,no,no,"Not unlocked it is still locked to AT&T with all their garbage on it and it is also defective. Screen turns on and doesn't turn off, causing it to overheat and kill battery. Tried everything to remedy this to no avail."
no,yes,no,"Purchased phone new (not used, refurb). Started using it Feb. 7. Now, I'm lucky to be able to use it as a phone: I'm either completely muffled or can't be heard at all. Handset mode or speaker. I'm also unable to enter an access / pin / participant code for conference calls."
yes,yes,yes,I like this Samsung galaxy S5 phone that I had recently purchased although it does have a couple of minor but in my opinion a significant manufacturing issues and the most important one being that the camera lens on the back of the phone when I received it had a protective plastic film over the lens...
yes,yes,yes,Not good for international sims.
no,no,no,"Im ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I only had the phone barely 6 months, and its broke. Never been dropped never been wet not a single scratch on it. I want my money back"
yes,yes,yes,Great smart phone. At times outsmarts itself by trying to jump ahead of the user'support intelligence.
yes,yes,yes,"Love love love it, happiest I've ever been with a phone. Thank you for a promise on this product."
yes,yes,yes,It works great and is as advertised. It is an AT&T phone. I have Metro PCS and I can't figure out how to uninstall the AT&T apps. I went with the S5 because the S6 doesn't have an SD card slot or a removable battery.
no,no,no,"People can't hear me. I can hear them. I want to return it. Samsung Galaxy S5 G900A Unlocked Cellphone,..."
yes,yes,yes,"After previously using the Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, the S5 feels and looks like and iPhone!! Much easier to use and love the bigger screen."
yes,yes,yes,I ordered 3 of these for me and my 2 kids. Mine was trouble free but the other 2 both had/have issues that should not be present. I do not believe that the problems are from misuse or abuse.
no,no,no,Had nothing but problems with this phone switching to metro p.c.s. Bought 2 of the same phones from other co. And had no problems switching . Ready to return this one.caveat emptor. Buyer Beware.
no,yes,no,"I bought the Samsung S5 ""new"" and what I received was a device that did not work and had to return it."
yes,yes,yes,Exactly as described. No problems with switching out my old sim for a new one at AT&T. And so far all features are acting at 100%. Thanks for helping us all avoid the extremely high rates of single phone purchases!
no,no,yes,"I downloaded ""phone info"" app to know the history of the phone and it said it was charged 2473 times ???? I just had it for 2 days and I don't believe I've plugged it that many times . Plus can't use flash light in camera because it says you have to wait for it to cool down????"
no,yes,no,This has just 3 months warranty. Also came with AT&T settings.
yes,yes,yes,I would have loved the had the phone but it wasn't compatible with tracfone. The sims card I bought wouldn't fit it.
yes,yes,yes,Excelente producto
no,yes,yes,"the phone screen become black . Searched on the web , i found lots of similar issue . I tried different workwround , but was not able to get it back . Don't buy it ."
yes,yes,yes,"Hi I received this product even before the expected date. The product is good no damage to it. I really appreciate it. The product, Samsung Galaxy S5 is good and has been working without any problems since I received it. Thank you all."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone! I've dropped it a couple of times and it does not even have a crack!
yes,yes,yes,"Phone came just as described with all the accessories needed! Fast, reliable, AND WATER PROOF. I do recommend always checking the charger port tab to ensure no liquid goes in and thoroughly drying it before setting it back down."
yes,yes,yes,I have one and I'm completely happy with it. Runs the latest kitkat 4.4.2 this product is water proof and dust proof. You can go swimming with it in your pocket and be fine. It has a feature called download booster that uses 4g and wifi at the same time to download things really fast.
yes,yes,yes,Worked just perfect just installed the sim card from previous phone and started using it right away
yes,no,yes,So much lag. Come on Samsung you gotta improve the software on addition to the hardware!
yes,yes,yes,"An excellent phone. Great phone, very good camera, and a fine computer in your pocket. I use tracfone in their bring your own phone program. An unbeatable combination."
no,no,no,"I was very disappointed. The phone arrived nicely packed, very pretty, i was so excited, until i tried to turn it on and it would not work. I thought the battery was the problem, so i charged it for an hour, still would not come on. I tried different power outlets to charge, still would not work."
no,yes,yes,"Love the phone, but the damn thing won't keep a charge. It was on 100%. Not even an hour later of not even being on it it was at 4%. I think its a defective battery so I bought a new battery. We will see if it helps or not...."
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had the phone for a few weeks now. Everything has worked very well for me so far. The voice recognition has been very helpful for me and allows me to interact with the phone without someone helping, as I am in a wheelchair and can't use my hands."
yes,yes,yes,"It took me about 4 hours to transfer all my apps, accounts and passwords on this sleek looking phone. The phone itself is very nice: white, slim, and stylish. The box it came in looked brand new, but the power adapter was in a used ziplock bag. I am not sure how that could have happened."
yes,yes,yes,Works Great! I ❤ It! So Far So Good. Thnx. I'll Let Ya'll Know If I Have Any Problems With It :)
no,no,no,Phone was suppoes to be new and unlocked. Phone was received locked. Contacted Samsung support and they said the only way a factory reset lock could happen is if the phone was a demo or used because it had to be registered and deactiated for this type of lock to happen.
no,no,no,"This item was listed as New but the one I received is either used or a return merchandise, it doesn't have the Samsung original plastic tape at the back cover and the side. Perceivable scratches on the rim and someone already put in a screen protector."
no,yes,no,Be careful everybody!!!!!!! I received a very cheap looking phone that you can easily would think its a toy !!!! no battery !!!!! wowwwwwwww!!!!!! I hope they at least give me the refund after returning this ….
no,no,no,"I'm very disappointed by this purchase, the phone I received was USED and not new as was listed. The phone came unlocked and in a very good working condition, BUT the application "" Samsung phone INFO"" told us that this phone was charged 1010 times before, DO YOU IMAGINE?"
yes,yes,yes,It is great phone. I received it very fast. plug in sim card and 64 GB memory microSD works good. I like s5 it can swipe out battery and memory easily.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone for a week now and works like new...almost. When I got it there were some scratches on the front camera flash but it doesn't seem to affect the picture quality. It arrived in the original packaging with everything: headphones, battery charger and instructions."
yes,yes,yes,Just as expected ALTHOUGH... I wish they would include a REAL book on info for how to use/ set up etc etc this phone !
yes,yes,yes,"Delivery was right on time. Brand new out the box. AT&Tphone, Works with my Straight talk services. Only thing it has all apps from at&t and some you can't delete. But other than that awesome phone!"
no,yes,yes,"It won't connect to ATT network!! Using 2 known good sims in an area with a known good signal, (CT, USA) if I reboot it shows a very weak LTE signal for a few minutes, then nothing - ""Mobile network not available"". When I switch the sim back to my old (S2) phone that works just fine."
no,no,yes,"I've had nothing but problems since I bought this phone in January. After writing to the dealer who sold it and got no reply, I finally bought a new $40 battery since the phone wouldn't hold a charge."
yes,yes,yes,I am loving my new phone! This was a gift to myself and an upgrade from the S3. This is my second android and I am so glad I switched from blackberry. I don't think I will be upgrading to the new S6 because that phone does not have an external memory slot and that is a deal breaker for me.
yes,no,yes,it was NOT unlocked and I had a hard time getting it unlocked! The phone itself I love!
no,yes,no,"I bought my phone from JP Mobiles LLC and thought that it was still carrier locked, i.e. it works fine on the AT&T 4G LTE network, but when a T-Mobile SIM is inserted, the phone throws up an error message and does not connect."
yes,yes,yes,love color excellent product
yes,yes,yes,Great Phone . I like it better than my old iPhone 5s
yes,no,yes,"This is a good company to work with. The Phone was defective and the company went out of there way to make every thing right. Samsung makes excellent phones, Great camera. I gave it a 5 ,because of the company!"
yes,yes,yes,"I was sceptical about this phone at first, but I finally decided to buy it instead of an IPhone because of the waterproof feature, I got it in a few days brand new, charged her up and I really liked the phone!"
no,no,no,The Phone has been giving problems since its arrived..So i will never purchase phone with this dealer again.Bad choice
no,no,no,The phone can not use the finger printer was broken when try recently open. I hope this Breed company changed me because I have one year of warranty.
yes,yes,yes,I've has my phone for two days now and it's been working great!!! I was currently with straight talk and all I did was switched my Sim card to this phone and updated my apn settings. Was extremely easy. Love the camera !!! Pictures are crystal clear! Samsung did great with the s5!
yes,yes,yes,Excelent service!!! Just as expected!
yes,yes,yes,"For now, it's been great. No issues. Brand new. Hoping I can hang onto it for a few years maybe."
yes,yes,yes,"Unlocked! Works as expected. Verified with Cricket, T-Mobile, and AT&T. Uses LTE with AT&T and Cricket. A bit bloated with AT&T pre-installed software, but that can be easily moved out of the way (and if not fully uninstalled then just simply disabled to never show up again)."
no,yes,yes,"Was not fully unlocked, had to root it to make the hotspot work, haven't tried the wifi calling, I use both T-Mobile and a Colombian SIM card, 4G Ltd on T-Mobile was good and 4G on Movistar was fine. No issues with this device."
no,yes,no,I received a demo phone & I had to return it
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. Worth every penny spent.
yes,yes,yes,"Nice hand size, needed to purchase extra guide book to instruct on all features."
yes,yes,yes,Hi I brought it as a gift to a friend for Christmas gift early. They said that they really enjoy it.they also said that they would rate it at a 4
no,no,yes,"No dents in the screen and that was good. I replace the charge port cover, no big deal. The only problem I have with the unit is that the battery life is pretty short. I get about 6 hours of battery life."
yes,yes,yes,Not too impressed. Wanted to go back my s4 after getting this phone. I hate the speaker on this phone. People always complain about a muffled sound when I use it.
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone, I'm really happy with the purchase, love the screen and all the options it gives you, the only thing I didn't like much in the beginning was all the settings that you have to go through, but once you get used to that is not a problem anymore."
yes,no,yes,I was really impressed with this phone! Worked like a charm with straight talk. You will need to change the mobile data usage from att to straight talk if you use straight talk though. Straight talk can walk you through how.
yes,yes,yes,"I've been using iPhones since the 3g but I have to say that after using the S5, Apple is eating they're dust. Love this phone! There's no need for me to make any comparisons since there are hundreds all over the web already."
yes,no,yes,"Display The display is very vivid and very responsive, in fact it really surprised me. You can have the s5 in a clear plastic bag and have clear gloves on and use the device perfectly with no problems."
no,yes,yes,The phone is great but beware....With the Unlocked AT&T version you can not use the tethering/hotspot function. I bought this phone to use in Canada and abroad and being able to tether my Tablet was most important.
yes,yes,yes,Phone looked like new and included original box and accessories!
yes,yes,yes,"Product is great, I sent this one back though because it would not get 4G with I wireless carrier even though it had all of the correct advertised frequency bandwith's. So only purchase this if you have AT&T."
no,yes,no,I got a retail demo phone with no charger in the box. I had to return this because AT&T could not transfer my service to the phone. They couldn't transfter service because the phone is locked as a retail demo.
no,yes,no,WiFi hot spot is not avaliable
yes,yes,yes,"Exactly what I was looking for, really happy with my the new phone. It was brand new as advertised and shipped fast."
yes,yes,yes,I was skeptic at first because I had never ordered a cell online before. A lot of my friends have this phone. I have had the iPhone since they first issued iPhones. But Ive become fed up with iPhone and they're bugs and glitches and updates and so on and so on. Well I was surprised.
yes,yes,yes,I purchased this S5 upgrading from a S2 (had several debates with myself before making this decision because my S2 is still an amazing phone as well). I was worried the S5 would not stand up to the S2 but... Absolutely awesome phone. I am glad I won the debate with me and myself.
yes,yes,yes,I love that phone.
yes,yes,yes,I COULD NOT BE MORE PLEASED. I USE THIS PHONE WITH STRAIGHT TALK AND LOVE IT.
yes,yes,yes,all excellent and unlock the phone came back I'm very happy new 100% recommend
yes,yes,yes,This is an amazing product that my wife fell in complete love with.
yes,yes,yes,"So far, it's terrific. No problems and a nice phone. I've had it for several months and still give it 5 stars. I use Consumer Cellular and it works fine. I only had to call and get the VPN settings to be able to access both the 4G network and my data plan."
yes,yes,yes,Received brand new phone in sealed pack. Works fine without any issues. Loving the product.
yes,yes,yes,Came nicely packaged and I've had it for about 2 MN the it I wrk fine with Simple Mobile ☺ *update. Phone is still working great. I love it...
yes,yes,yes,Really like my Samsung phone. It has all the features I need and works really smoothly. The camera takes great photos also
yes,yes,yes,"It's a great device. Got tired of my iphone 4s having issues, including a lack of memory, apps failing, and primarily not sending or receiving phone calls. This phone, however, does everything I need and the screen is bigger."
yes,yes,yes,Love it! So much better than the IPhone 5 we had. My wife had a lot of trouble with the IPhone and we could never configure it to work for her. The Galaxy is much more flexible and she loves the larger screen.
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy S5 G900A, funciona perfecto , viene desbloqueado, pantalla grande, viene con varias aplicaciones pre-instaladas de AT&T, lo recomiendo 100%"
yes,yes,yes,"Great product! only complaint is the speaker is in the back, which is quite inconvenient if i lie the phone down, and also the microphones are sort of unidirectional and don't pick up sound very well unless you're speaking into it closely and in a particular angle."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is all right, the only thing I don't like is the battery...I have to charge everyday."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my very first smart phone after resisting the the upgrade for so long. I gotta say it's pretty dang neat. Word to the wise though, whoever is cleaning these before reselling, is NOT wiping the data."
no,no,no,I bought the galaxy s5 unlocked but when I went to activate to the line it was locked and I have to pay to unlocked
yes,yes,yes,I use this phone with straight talk and it works great. The phone didn't have any scratches or anything. Overall I'm extremely pleased with it.
yes,yes,yes,I'm very happy with the purchase
no,yes,yes,I gave it a 4 * because the phone volume/sound is not as loud as the previous SII and S III when playing music or talking
yes,yes,yes,"Got this phone because it was waterproof. Upon receipt, there was a chunk of the actual phone, right next to the charging port, missing. Thus, nor waterproof. Very disappointing. Other than that, it takes beautiful pictures and great phone reception."
yes,yes,yes,I'm happy with my new galaxy s5. It works perfectly.
yes,yes,yes,Love everything about it except the charging Samsung should have left it like the S4 on the S5 it has a little door to open and shut and plugging the charger into the phone can be quite annoying.
no,yes,no,The phone was fine for a few days after the 1st week the battery like is really bad you have to continually be charging the phone. Also sometimes when you receive text messages it doesn't down them. I was happy with the phone with the phone for a few days.
yes,yes,yes,Works very well but it has the same annoying problem as my last Galaxy of repeatedly warning me that the case is not fully closed despite it appearing to be tight.
yes,yes,yes,T-mobile phone....works great after getting proper sized SIM from T-mobile store. Phone is like new.
yes,yes,yes,"It's just as good as the lady one I bought, only newer!"
yes,yes,yes,Everything I wanted in a phone
yes,yes,yes,Except for turning itself off at random times it works great.
no,yes,no,You can't hear the phone when it ring and you can't listen to music with ear plugs
yes,yes,yes,Works great. I bought 2 phones and it's been 4 months. They both are working like new. No problem and came in the condition as stated in description. Very happy.
no,no,no,Do not buy this phone it does not work!! It is not compatible to American networks or overseas ..I guess it only works in Korea and they do not accept returns!! waste of a lot of money. ..Do not buy!
yes,yes,yes,Excelent Cell phone
no,no,no,i recived the phone but is not the one i ordered instead of SM-G900H i recived an SM-G906K a koreen version..! is a copy of the original one!my network its not stablished ..i lose connection all the time!i want to return it and recive my money..
no,no,yes,I don't like the item can i give it back cuz the battery gets low too fast and gets too warm I really want to give it back
yes,yes,yes,"I never had a smart phone, and am so glad I choose this one. It's awsome, I love it, my little PC!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, all the same features of the S5 but the buttons are different on the front of the device"
no,no,yes,Just wished the power button wasnt across from the volume buttons. When doing one handed use and trying to control volume the power button would always be pressed and shut off the phone.
yes,yes,yes,I like the Sport version since it is a little more rugged than the regular version. It has been a great phone.
no,yes,no,"I upgraded from an S3. I liked the S3 a lot, but the bluetooth became erratic. It would turn off for no reason, which was a problem in my bluetooth enabled car. Apparently this is a common problem with S3s."
yes,yes,yes,"I have been a loyal Samsung customer for 2 years. I own both the S5 and S5 Sport. I previously owned an S3. I believe there are ""I phone people"" and ""Samsung people"". I am definitely a Samsung person. I love the quality, features, and ease of use."
yes,yes,yes,"Fast processor, great features, multitasking is very smooth and fast. I love this phone! Also very durable."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had the original galaxy, the galaxy 3 & now this one. They are nothing but trouble. They start off great then they turn to garbage! I have had to have a master reset done on the 5 on 3 separate occasions & i haven't had it a year yet. This will be my last galaxy product!"
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. Helps me in every aspect of my life.
no,yes,yes,"It was a great phone that I loved. But after having it for a year, the performance went way down. The phone would often turn off randomly even when I was on the phone. Then after dropping the one in water for about ten seconds, its performance decreased even more."
yes,yes,yes,Love it makes my day it doesn't slow down it has its own wifi the battery lasts long
yes,yes,yes,"Great screen display, strong battery life and awesome features"
yes,yes,yes,"The design of the Galaxy S5 Sport is significantly different than the standard version of the GS5 released back in the spring. While the phone maintains a similar footprint and silhouette, it features a boxy, ruggedized build incorporating contrasting plastic accents in matte and faux-chrome..."
no,no,yes,The phone has average functions and battery life is less than average
yes,yes,yes,"Loved this phone because it was water resistant, durable,"
yes,yes,yes,"This is my 3rd samsung phone and amongst them all, this phone is definitely the best. I like the speed, i like the quality and design. The phone is also really great for playing games, they run so smoothly on this phone that im not planning buying any new phone soon for the time being."
yes,no,yes,"ive had this phone for a few months now and its definitely stood up to the abuse of my 4 year old who enjoys his minecraft. Battery life is something to be desired. The features are awesome. Sometimes it randomly shuts off, not a big deal to me. Phone calls are clear.Texting is smooth."
yes,no,yes,"I am not very technology savvy, but this phone is so wonderful and easy to use, my kids are annoyed with me, lol. Mostly because they're not having to help me understand my phone's features."
yes,yes,yes,"I had phones for the last 20 year's they the best phone I ever had. Very reliable confortable and N not many problems, I really recommend did Samsung devicesdevices."
no,no,no,This phone haa a wifi that wont go off keep coming back on even tho I've done everything that was suggested to me by your site it interupts my internet signal and shuts me down until i go turn it back off its very annoying
yes,yes,yes,"I got this for my son and now I'm jealous. I have an iPhone 5 and I feel the Galaxy 5 sport is so much better, years ahead of iPhone. I plan on my next phone definitely coming from the Samsung Galaxy family."
yes,yes,yes,good design the battery life falls off after a few months of using it
no,yes,yes,"I bought this phone based on the fitness features and durability . The features are great! The durability not so much, I dropped my phone in my office from about a 3 feet on to the carpeted floor and the Invisible Shield Glass screen protector and the phone glass screen cracked!"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone for active people, very durable, good size, battery last a long time."
yes,yes,yes,"I Love This Samsung ,It Provides Me To Do Many Thins On The Web Nice And Quick. It Also Helps Me Get Information Fast And It Have Great Graphics."
yes,yes,yes,"Hard to find cases and the screen is really fragile, good thing I got the glass screen protector. The apps are really good. I'm in love with S Health. The battery lasts far longer than any other phone I've had. All in all I wish I'd gotten the S5 instead."
no,yes,no,I REALLY LIKE THE DURABILITY OF THIS PHONE. IVE DROPPED IT SEVERAL TIMES AND NEVER DAMAGED IT. IT IS ALSO TRULY WATER RESISTANT. I DROPPED IT IN THE RIVER WHEN WE WENT HIKING AND TO MY SURPRISE IT WAS NOT HURT BY BEING UNDER WATER. I AM KIND OF DISAPPOINTED IN THE BATTERY LIFE.
yes,yes,yes,"So, I love my S5. I really do. However, the Android Lollipop upgrade gave it a couple of unwelcome quirks. They are not dealbreaker quirks, but irritating sometimes. That, however, is an Android thing, really. All the other features and hardware have been fantastic!"
no,yes,yes,"My phone worked great for about a month and then it updated one day and now the battery life only lasts about 3 hours. If I turn off the wifi or mobile data, it just turns it back on."
yes,yes,yes,I like the sleek design. The battery life is amazing. Its lasts at least 12+ hours without needing to be recharged.
yes,yes,yes,I love everything on my phone is versatility beautiful and amazing.
yes,yes,yes,"I had the galaxy S3 before this phone and it was a nice upgrade. Bigger screen and very user friendly. I wish the phone had more battery life, but for being on my phone all day last a long time"
yes,yes,yes,I like my phone. The camera is great and has many features. My battery does not stay charged long. That is my only concern with this phone.
yes,yes,yes,I love Samsung phones. Love that this one is waterproof and in cherry red. My favorite color.
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I have ever used! It is truly a remarkable device! I passed on the Samsung Galaxy 6 since it did not have the capability to use replacement batteries. I do appreciate being able to carry an extra battery in case my phone 'dies' and I am not close to a power source.
yes,yes,yes,"Great battery life, awesome durability. The only complaint i have is the 4 month delay for the 5.0 Lollipop. For this reason i will no longer buy variants."
yes,no,yes,"Upgraded from a GS4 so its a little bigger and water resistant. Otherwise, pretty much the same. Loved the S4 and this is even better! Was holding out for the S6 until I found out there is no removable battery or memory card slot."
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I have ever had. It's a perfect size and easy to use. I actually don't have to be smarter then my smart phone. lol
yes,yes,yes,This Sprint phone exceeds my expectations. It does everything I need it to perfectly.
yes,yes,yes,I have always used Samsung phones and have had almost every Galaxy phone...
yes,yes,yes,Unfamiliar with the phone. User manual would help.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is truly a great one, in terms of technical specifications and abilities. The camera is, for many situations, better than my actual digital camera, and I really like how easy it is to move files around."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new Galaxy S5 Sport. Especially love the S Health app and use it everyday. I am amazed at the number of food items they have for tracking your calories. Definitely a must have for those looking to focus on getting healthy. Paired with the gear fit it is even better.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this phone about 4 months ago, and it still runs as fast and great as when I first got it. The screen is a perfect size, and the sport design makes it super durable. Takes amazing picture/video and overall just a great phone. Would definitely recommend!"
yes,yes,yes,"Easy to use,understand. Very happy with my Galaxy S 5 Sport performance."
no,no,yes,"I upgraded from a galaxy s3 and switched over from Verizon.I loved my s3, the only problem I had was the phone was that I went through two of them. One kicked the bucket and another had damage from myself.When I first received my s5 it it was working fine but when I did the software update the phone..."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing. Its rugged but has a stylish and awesome color. Its fast and doesn't get burning hot like some of the older Galaxy S phones. Definitely is water proof because mine got accidentally spilled on by my youngest son.
yes,no,yes,I was a little worried about this purchase as I saw some bad reviews saying that they received a random or scratched phone. Mine was perfect. It looked brand new. It was the blue phone advertised. It DID come with the straight talk sim card.
yes,yes,yes,"...no ' electric blue', no ' free ' screen protector, no SIM card included, but brand new phone w/fully charged battery. Where can I get a SIM for my straight talk prepaid?"
no,no,no,Didn't work in my area
no,no,no,Don't believe the hype......Phone does not come with some card and is not a straight talk phone...L spent two weeks trying to resolve my problem...Ended up getting a refund...PS...Was not a real galaxy s5..It was a knock off
no,no,no,The instructions helped a lot I just wish I didn't mess up my first one being anxious. It fits reduce glare by a lot unfortunately anyone can see my phone clearly now haha. But it definitely keeps fingerprints away.
yes,yes,yes,Was the phone I wanted
no,no,no,I bought the phone with the understanding it was completely unlocked. I quickly found it wasn't and cannot be unlocked due to a previous bill on the account! I'm very angry these people should not be selling phones that aren't unlocked.
yes,yes,yes,Love my new phone. Works great and was fully charged when I received it so all I had to do was add it to my existing Straight Talk plan and I was up and running.
yes,yes,yes,We ordered this phone sometime ago and it works perfectly. My teen loves it.
yes,yes,yes,"It's a good phone, but it wasn't the phone that was advertised. It's advertised as blue, but it was white. It also looks new, but it's clearly used. Otherwise it's a great phone and I'm happy with it, but it's really poorly advertised, what I got is hardly what I expected to get."
yes,yes,yes,I was nervous about buying a phone online but it came with its original packaging and it was as expected. This was my first android product and personally I didn't like it and sent it back as I am more of a apple person. But it was wonderful if you want an android phone.
no,no,no,"It stopped charging after 2 days, luckily it was just a bad cord that I had to purchase"
yes,yes,yes,Bought for my mum. She's happy with it. Seems to all work great
yes,no,yes,"For a second hand phone, i would highly recommend this product! In amazing condition considering it was second hand, just a slight mark on the charging port cover, which was hardly noticeable and expected for the price i paid!"
no,no,no,This was NOT unlocked. Now it must be returned.
yes,yes,yes,Super top notch would buy again if I won the lottery.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone with all the features I need. Good battery life.
yes,yes,yes,Great product just a's described
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic camera. Great value buy.
yes,yes,yes,Pleased with phone
no,no,no,Quality is s. phone doesnt turn on and keeps putting homescreen and turn it off. cant believe how such a brand exists
no,yes,yes,"I was under the impression the phone itself was blue. but it turns out its just the back cover that is blue, other than that the phone is fine and works"
yes,yes,yes,As described. Good phone for this price
yes,yes,yes,The Best cell Phone I ever had.
yes,yes,yes,The charging port cover cracked off right away. Other wise it's a great phone
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product very good quality
yes,yes,yes,My son loves his phone. Thank you for such quick service! Awesome!
no,yes,no,"Too hot cell , I hope not fault factory"
yes,yes,yes,Awsome phone works very well no complaints Great purchase!!! No problem using the phone in the Bahamas(Nassau).
yes,yes,yes,"This was a gift for my wife, she use to have the S4, and she really love this one, She like more the white color instead of the black one, the only thing is the charger, it come with the charger for Europe, but since she already had the charger for the S4, this wasn't a problem."
yes,yes,yes,only walcharger wasn't US ones
no,no,yes,You said its a 16 GB!! Why my phone it just 11 GB??
no,yes,yes,This Samsung galaxy s5 working on network 4G
yes,yes,yes,Im using it right now. great phone
no,no,yes,"the screen is black, is not possible the use"
yes,yes,yes,Attention: this a octo-core cell phone - the quad-core phones are faster
no,no,yes,the phone came with the wrong charging cable! The charging cable is for a different model of samsung!
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone, everything works perfectly data plans and all....Delta mobiles you're the best"
yes,yes,yes,I want to buy this phone but i want to make sure its really really brand new
yes,yes,yes,The price is incredible. It met all my expectations
yes,yes,yes,Very nice phone. Original box with original packaging.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone was with Android accessibility options of blind person, took me forever to get ride of this"
no,no,no,NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH CHUBBIES TECH!!! Phone stopped picking up WiFi after less than 4 months and Bluetooth is intermittent at best. They give you a 60 day warranty on a phone selling for $400 and if it breaks before then....TOO BAD!!
yes,yes,yes,Good condition phone. Only came with a little chip on the corner but your could just get a caseto cover that up. And there was only one minor sscratch on the screen. Very satisfied phone functions as if I were new. I recommend you get this. Its a win. Trust me.✌
yes,yes,yes,Excellent. Equipment like new. 100% recommended
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. More than expected! I thought I had a sophisticated smart phone before upgrading to this one, it does not compare to this one!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. Moved up from an S3, and found the extras well worth it. Wasn't sure I'd like the slightly bigger screen, but do, and it still fits in my pocket, though a bit tighter. I have yet to see any advantage to an IPhone when the Samsung phones are so much more user friendly and capable."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Somehow I ended up with a doa charging/data cable. No big deal, I blame samsung. Everything else was perfect!"
yes,no,yes,so pleased with my order I would definitely order from this company again
yes,yes,yes,Very good thank you A+A+
yes,yes,yes,Worth buying came unlocked
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded to this Galaxy S5 from my Galaxy S4. It is a definite improvement from the larger, clearer display to the water resistant housing, to the features. Excellent product!"
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone, wish it had more internal memory, ATT is ridiculous for offering a 16 gig phone in this day and age"
yes,yes,yes,"Pros: It's super fast, has a fingerprint scanner, takes an external sd card, can take your pulse, has a beautiful display, and was easy to set up Cons: The menu buttons do different things than previous models which is still throwing me off, the auto brightness is way too dark in a dark room,..."
yes,yes,yes,My significant other loves her new GS5. Works flawlessly with Consumer Celluar (AT&T network). Phone was brand new and runs 4G LTE (here in the United States) wonderfully. Might have to purchase another for myself. Very happy with my purchase. Would be glad to by through BREED again.
yes,yes,yes,"excellent, very good"
no,yes,yes,I was disappointed by the device.. It did not support 4G LTE for TMobile as it was represented in the specs. Otherwise I am sure it was a good phone
yes,yes,yes,"I am very pleased with the service and product quality, I recommend 100%"
yes,yes,yes,THIS DEVICE IOS IN PERFERCT CINTION. AWESOME JOB!!!!
no,yes,no,As soon as we received this phone it started messing up! First the charger quit working within 12 hours of use and then the phone started messing up. This phone has a lot of cool features and is really cool everything you need but I would suggest buying from a different company.
yes,yes,yes,"Christmas present for son, who loved it."
yes,yes,yes,So loving my phone thank you wireless expert
yes,yes,yes,"camera,,,, really crisp pictures, they are saved by day, nice feature sending pictures, to send a picture all you need to do is check the pictures you are sending, text or email.. so simple.. easy to set up pages, and move icons. plenty of customizable features."
yes,yes,yes,Phone filled with AT&T bloat but works good
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works really well, I have had it for about a month now and so far no problems"
no,no,no,"Horrible horrible horrible. Do not waste your money. Antenna in phone went faulty in less than 2 months. Gets horrible service now, and it's not because of my service provider. Phone hasnt been dropped or had any water damage. Have to take phone in for repairs, praying they can fix the issue."
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone, works well"
yes,yes,yes,"The picture is beautiful, and it has awesome useful features. I love the size and it works well with my AT&T go service. The problems were, the speaker and the motherboard. I can hear people well on my end but they have a hard time hearing me."
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone! I have had an excellent experience with my new phone and would recommend it to anyone! Samsung always produces amazing products.
no,yes,no,"I have had the issue of people not being able to hear me when I'm on a phone call. That's not acceptable to me. I'm sending this phone back and I'm going to order a new one, hopefully the new one will work properly."
yes,yes,yes,I got this for my daughter who phone was dying on her so far she is very happy.
yes,yes,yes,"A good buy, works with AT & T."
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. It is a very good phone.
no,yes,no,"The phone arrived and didn't work for even a day, I'm returning it."
no,no,yes,"I love the phone, my only issues are the battery dies to quick, and doesn't work in certain areas it needs to be Verizon not att, I suggest you check service area first. Oh ya and earplugs don't work, it's the phone because I tried other ear plugs and they didn't work either."
yes,yes,yes,"This a an excellent phone, I am still setting up all its functions, but am very pleased with it so far. It comes with some AT&T apps and instructions, but I am using it for T-Mobile."
yes,yes,yes,"Delivered in excellent conditions works well thus far, will give an update in 3 months."
yes,no,yes,I would give it 5 stars but the camera has two spots in the camera that every time I take a shot they are there. As I circled in the pic below. Good thing I use Corel Photo shop alot to correct pics so I can easily remove them but man I know this phone has amazing picture capabilities but my luck...
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good. The phone is really nice and fast. What I am surprised about is that the battery life blows. My Alcatel, tracfone, has a better battery than the S5. I have been following all the online tricks to extend battery life, but it is dead after a few hours."
yes,yes,yes,"Just got my phone a couple days ago, and I'm loving it. Phone is very fast, able to multitask by having different windows open."
yes,yes,yes,Everything is easy to access
yes,yes,yes,"Just learning to use a smart phone. So far have only used as a phone and not with the aps yet. The only disappointing aspect is the volume which to me, at 72, is poor to fair and on Maximum only half as loud as my former flip phone."
no,no,yes,This is an AT&T phone. There is an AT&T symbol on the back of the phone. It is not the phone advertised.
yes,yes,yes,"I was concerned it would not be a NEW phone, but it was. Everything came in the original box with all the necessary accessories. I took it to AT&T and they put in the SIM card and helped me load my address book and other helpful things. It is a bit overwhelming as I had a little flip phone before."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my FIRST ""smart phone!"" So I am still learning how to use all the functions. My best friend has the same phone and loves it and will continue to help me. I personally like Samsung products in general. So....."
no,no,no,All right but battery cause problem 4 month after use.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this for my GF because she was tired of apple. We have had no issues with this phone. She likes it a lot no restrictions like apple, it also charges faster than her old iPhone 6."
yes,yes,yes,"Perfect... but I wish it includes SD card, headphones."
yes,no,yes,"Phone is a bit cumbersome to learn navigation. But is is a great size, has a very clear screen and is fast. However I had terrible connectivity problems, especially wifi problems in multiple locations. I am frugal with data plans so wifi connections was a critical part of my usage."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone itself works fine, it was technically brand new, no dings or dents or scratches. The only problem that I had was that the charging port cover does NOT close, it just flops about not closing."
yes,yes,yes,"I like it, it works just fine."
yes,yes,yes,Works fine; so far.
yes,yes,yes,Brand new. Everything works great!
no,no,no,This phone can work in South America ?
yes,yes,yes,Nice quality feature I love how I bought it with a screen protector
no,yes,no,"Not unlocked... It says unlocked but I am stuck with AT&T junk. I am using Cricket SIM. Since Cricket and AT&T are same, it works. However, I cant adjust any call waiting/forwarding etc, since it is looking for AT&T and my sim is cricket."
no,no,no,Very nice phone if it would charge. Unfortunately it would not charge at all. I tried several things including a new charger and cable. I guess it must have had a bad battery or charging port. I had to send it back.
no,no,no,"While this phone is new, Samsung ran the EMEI number on the phone I received to confirm it is not covered under their warranty at all."
no,no,no,Phone started turning off randomly after one month of use.
yes,yes,yes,Great great greatly appreciated and amazing thank you I loveee it
no,yes,no,I regretted why I purchased this phone. Information given on this phone was not true. This is false advertising. I was disappointed that the phone was not what I read about and not what I purchased.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great and works just like one you could get from a retailer.
yes,yes,yes,Do not buy this phone they are used phones selling them like theyare new
no,no,no,Wtf the phone is locked!! I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥
no,no,no,"my phone stopped working at 6 months and samsung will not work on them,,,,,dont order from this person,,,,waste of money,,,and your phone insurance wont touch it either"
no,no,yes,"Be careful: I thought I was buying this phone from BREED INC., as that's who the page said was selling them when I purchased it, instead it was a different company. With this different company, the phone I got that was supposed to be NEW, seemed a little USED, because there was already scratches and..."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone very happy with it!

yes,yes,yes,"It was very good. No problems, it works over seas (Jamaica, Digicel)"
yes,yes,yes,"Scrath product, es usado no nuevo!!"
no,yes,no,"If it wasn't for the antenna booster i bought, this cell phone is unusable. I can't hardly get any service in places where my daughters Samsung J4 gets services easily. The back cover is made of the lowest grade of material that it cracked easily when i replace it after inserting a memory and sim..."
no,no,no,It says that the phone is unlocked but actually it's not. The phone I received was an Att locked phone that would not work with my tmobile line. At least write the description correctly so that people don't waste their time and energy on this!
yes,yes,yes,"Good quality and condition, great price"
yes,yes,yes,"Got the phone yesterday, everything working great. PROS: - films in 4k video ( will not allow you to snap pics while in this mode which is fine ) - films in 1080p HD Video for a lower resolution - 16 MP camera with a host of settings ( ISO 100-800 ) - Mic is awesome for pod casts or voice journals -..."
no,no,no,There is a perennial issue with the Samsung S5 involving failure of the microphone. Antenna quality is extraordinarily poor. An entirely low-quality product.
yes,yes,yes,"I hope receive, Just once, tomorrow august 25 or Friday August 26, thanks."
yes,no,yes,"Product came in, let's say, original packaging. But this phone is previously owned by AT&T then seller unlocked it. Just hate that AT&T logo on back cover. Phone is working perfectly and I'm happy about that."
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung galaxy s5 arrived early, and my seller included a gorilla glass screen protector free. Read your selection carefully. Phone was brand new, and is working well. And I love this Phone!"
yes,yes,yes,is cool! thank you!
yes,yes,yes,Can't complain twas over expectation
yes,yes,yes,It's brand new....???????
yes,yes,yes,The phone doesn't have flash for the camera
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone very much. It came with everything except the headsets. No scratch, no dense, looks just like new!"
no,no,no,Bad. Is refurbish.. i'm very annoying.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phonr! Geat camera features and makes very very ecent photos for cell phone. I recommend to use ballistic glass screen protector.
no,no,yes,"Even though this is an unlocked phone, it is unlocked for AT&T. Meaning: if you plan to use this on T-Mobile, some of the T-Mobile's perks are not available, ie Wi-Fi Hotspot. I purchased the S5 as an upgrade from my S4 mini."
no,no,no,Speaker was horrible...I couldn't hear without a tinging sound and other people couldn't hear me beyond a muffled sound.
yes,no,yes,I Received a diferent colour that I bought. I have to claim the shipping in 2 oportunities.
no,no,yes,"Sent the wrong phone. Cheap screen protector included is the nastiest, junkiest protector I've ever used."
yes,yes,yes,"Thank you I love my phone , I'm comfortable with it , this is really what I was looking for"
yes,yes,yes,"Good job, thank you."
yes,no,yes,Same old Samsung quality. Can't beat it
no,no,no,"I bought this phone after using a Samsung Galaxy S4 for 1.5 years. My Galaxy S4's both microphone and speaker stopped functioning in 3 months after I bought it (which apparently was a very frequent failure of S4), and after 1.5 year of usage one day the phone started to getting into a bootloop and..."
yes,yes,yes,My son really l iked this phone. Make sure you get a decent cover or skin or it
no,yes,yes,"Shipped very fast. I received a unit that was listed as ""like new"". It was cosmetically almost perfect. However, the charge port was wobbly and positional. The software would never load. It got stuck and I could never initialize the phone. Sent it back."
yes,yes,yes,"This was Consumer Report's top rated smart phone. Needless to say, I was very disappointed when it didn't live up to my expectations. Particular problems I experienced were: processor lag, flimsy materials (especially the removable back cover), and counter intuitive OS."
yes,yes,yes,This is a really great phone without any notable flaws.
no,no,yes,"When talking on the phone sometime you cant hear what the person is saying, all i hear is noises. Other than that it very fast."
yes,yes,yes,"Although aging, this is still the pentultimate smartphone for all general smartphone applications. Unlocked, it is entirely customisable and you can get the best and chepeast plans for smartphones that are widely avaialble."
yes,yes,yes,"I was forced into getting a smart phone because my carrier was retiring 2G services. I didn't want to pay $700 for a new phone, so I found this one online. I love the look and feel. I'm still learning about all the features but so far I've been able to customize it to my liking."
yes,no,yes,"I ordered an ATT unlocked phone but got, instead, a TMOBILE unlocked phone. Ultimately I decided it was cheaper and easier to keep it than fight for the right phone. I like it fine. I just wanted to have the ATT firmware on the phone."
no,no,no,"Have no doubt this phone is a referb. When I got it, it look great. then the screen started to roll. After replacing the screen it happened again and the only thought is that the motherboard is bad. Complete waste of money."
yes,no,yes,"A=AT&T; T=Tmobile etc. Although it's unlocked, and both Tmobile and ATT use GSM and this is a GSM phone, not everything that is usable on AT&T may be useable on Tmobile. I am finding this out the hard way with hours and hours of calls with Samsung, Tmobile, etc."
yes,yes,yes,"Upgraded to this after completely annihilating my s4 mini (it served its purpose well over the years). I didn't really see the need to get one of the latest Galaxy cell phones so i got the S5 as the specs are just as good as the latest phones (and let's face it guys, specs on these phones are..."
no,no,no,"Phone had many problems! Had to send back, company difficult to get a hold of."
yes,yes,yes,"It has the ""blank screen"" glitch, but I can live with that, otherwise a wonderful phone."
yes,yes,yes,Arrived as described
no,yes,yes,"I RECEIVED THIS PHONE IN TRINIDAD & TOBAGO FROM MY SHIPPING AGENT (trin e box) on March 31, 2016. IT FUNCTIONED GOOD UNTIL THE APRIL 22, 2016 WHEN THE SCREEN SUDDENLY WENT BLANK ALTHOUGH THE BATTERY WAS FULLY CHARGED AT THE TIME."
yes,yes,yes,Size and features
yes,yes,yes,Work perfect I give to to one of my friend en El Salvador he enjoyed
yes,yes,yes,"Well, the phone is serving the purpose that I basically need it for, but I have noticed some gliches, like auto correct that's not even words or that doesnt make any sense! Then a month and a half after I have had the phone, the back button just went out."
no,yes,yes,This phone was bought in February and already doesn't charge.
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with the phone. Have not found anything neg. about it yet.
yes,yes,yes,Phone works great.....I love it.
no,no,yes,"What an awful purchase.!!!!! The phone was not new, the charging port was jacked up and wouldn't charge well at all!! The problems went downhill from there. It was a complete POS!"
yes,yes,yes,If you purchase from a reputable vendor you will get exactly the brand new AT&T compatible Samsung S5 that works immediately on any AT&T/GSM network as soon as you plug in your sim card. I got mine from GoodGuys.
no,no,no,"I disliked this product because I bought this phone for my boyfriend. The day we received it, we turned the phone on and the screen was purple and black. You can't see anything on the screen. Can't even see the screen to power It on and off. It was a waste of $312."
yes,yes,yes,the phone looks very old and used
yes,yes,yes,I love it for the most part. It came quickly and looks like new. I bought my mom one also. Both from the good guys electronics and I'm happy with both. Sometimes the volume resets itself but I think that's more or a Samsung thing. Overall worth the money
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung S5 I would not trade it unless it got broken or something it does every thing I want it to .
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I have ever had so far. My quality of life has went up dramatically. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,fast and accurate service
yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. Nice size and light weight.
no,no,no,"The phone is nice looking but is defective. It was not charging. Don't know if it's the phone or the battery that is defective, definitely not the charging cable. I just sent it back. But just a head's up.... you pay for the cost of shipping it back."
no,yes,yes,"At the first soft hit, the display got broken. I'm still searching the cheapest way to fix it for my own because I bought it without warranty......some initial proposals to fix it are of about 500 usd! Almost the price of a new one!"
yes,yes,yes,This smartphone is magnificent. Any lover of smartphones will want to have this hand set. There is comfort in it. It is so light to handle for so long.it has multiple apps. It has exciting way of opening pages and a multi window sistem that makes it easy to operate.
yes,yes,yes,I've had this phone for around 8 hours so far so I'm probably still on a new purchase high but I have to say what really impressed me was that I was able to transfer all my items from my old iPhone to my new phone using Samsung Smart. This included my messages.
yes,yes,yes,"I suggest you buy this instead of the s6 and s6 edge.it has a far better screen in my opinion. It is waterproof and dust proof,you can replace the battery yourself and it has an sd card slot.all these things that the other two phones don't have.best of all it is cheap.it works great.it is a good..."
yes,yes,yes,"The S5 is a good phone easy to use and quick , Optus plans are good value and even include qantas frequent flyer points..."
yes,no,yes,"I have 3 x S5 Galaxies for the family that I re contracted for on the 25/11/2014 ($50 My Plan Plus +$15 for the Mobile) A $65:00 Per Mth OPTUS Mobile Plan, Thinking that this was a good Deal!"
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung galaxy S5 is a amazing smartphone. It allows users from all around the world to connect to each other with just one click. Having recently owned the Apple iPhone 5S, the S5, as it is bigger, better and faster in all the necessary tech features of the phone."
no,yes,yes,my telephone broke down after 5 months
yes,yes,yes,"it had a condition above believe, great"

yes,yes,yes,Nice mobile already got one but wanted a new one

yes,no,yes,I bought this phone used and I am very happy with it compared to my old phone. I have been using it for roughly 3 weeks now and am hoping I can keep it without issue for at least a year. It runs very quickly which is convenient and avoids frustration which I have had with previous phones.
yes,yes,yes,I DO NOT RECCOMEND!
no,no,no,"Poor service poor quality I would give you 0 if that was possible Sell items which are working , don't pack and dispatch if they are no good to anyone . Such a waste of time ."
yes,no,yes,"Needs a new battery ( I hope that,s all) wont charge past 73%. Other than which is a very basic requirement, it,s good. I,ll justget another battery."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works fine, just the 2 chargers that comes with it, doesn't work at all!"
yes,yes,yes,Good phone if not as robust as the iphones.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone arrived very fast. I replaced my SONY Z1 with G5 only because Sony could not sort battery discharging problems. At the moment phone looks like a good choose for money. If you are using phone to call, text and check your email or social network it's more then enough."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this for my son who goes through phones like they are toys!! Having had the iPhone 6 which failed him and the samsung S6 which he broke he decided to go back to the S5 which he found to be extremely reliable and amazingly put up with his work which is building and so his phones do go...

no,yes,no,Damaged and faulty item.
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful mobile it looks pretty and takes amazing photos!
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Minor gripes: the fingerprint scanner works by swipe not touch, and if you're using a case for the phone with a large protective lip around the screen this can make swiping the fingerprint awkward; and the waterproof cover over over the charging/microUSB port is a pain."
yes,yes,yes,Looks new and works well
no,yes,no,bought this phone as it stated unlocked and try to use it with vodafone sim card and it doesnt work! even though i bought it from samsung. not happy at all and will ask for refund
yes,yes,yes,"Marvelous i love it soo much , THXXXX"

yes,yes,yes,"The phone works, I am happy with it. It arrived in 2 days. Thank you,"
yes,no,yes,"After five months of having the phone i can safely say there is no problems with it, only thing to happen is the charging cover snapped off however this was my own fault and it is easily replaced."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent ! Great ! Fantastic. Importantly Seller's contributions are 100 percent ! Phone works superbly !
no,yes,yes,My phone has been freezing repeatedly. Took it to the phone shop and it turns out that this is due to tampering that has been done to the original software.
yes,yes,yes,Still getting usedto it but so far wow
yes,yes,yes,all good and as described
yes,yes,yes,The phone i recieved might as well have been brand new because I dont see a single sign of use. I bought this phone because my old 1st generation moro g didnt have enough internal memory or graphics power to play hearthstone. My new s5 runs it beautifully.
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone I owned until I got the s6 edge. My son uses it now for gaming, and it runs all his resource hogging games with no problems."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is absolutely awesome. The screen is vibrant and crisp, the speak is quite good, and the build quality is solid. The OS feels very coherent and the effect is that the phone works very well. Camera capability is extraordinary."
yes,yes,yes,Better than the s4 the battery life seems to lack a little compared to the 4 but still operable. Wish samsung didn't creat their version of an iphone...completely slandered android lovers everywhere.
yes,yes,yes,"phone works as should , just not as good condition as I hope"
yes,yes,yes,I actually purchased this exact phone from my local Boost Mobile. Their data plans (10 & 20 GB) are unmatched in the industry... $45 & $55? I was waffling back & forth between the S5 and S6.
yes,yes,yes,"It's super fast the ultimate phone in my opinion, plus its water proof. Cant beat it"
no,yes,no,"I've own 3 galaxy phones, (prevail, S3, and S5) and literally all of those phone have had the worst charging experience every. All of my galaxy phones broke because the charging port broke and I recommend you guys not to purchase a galaxy phone ever!"
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung galaxy s5. My favorite thing about it is the size. The features are great. I don't have to charge my battery a lot.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone!! Upgraded from an HTC to the S5. Phone came quickly and as advertised. Thanks
yes,yes,yes,Yes...the S5 is great..I enjoy the graphics ..phone is easy to navigate..totally happy
yes,yes,yes,"MY WIFE LOVES IT!!! and.... as the awesome husband that i am, i got her the best."
yes,yes,yes,I don't no why I waited to buy a great phone.
yes,yes,yes,i loveeeeee this phone and the price i got it for and the sellers also sent me some extra stuff with it i was like a child on xmas
yes,yes,yes,Soo happy with my new phone! <3. <3

yes,yes,yes,Bought this phone for my daughter. I am happy with the purchase so far. No trouble. The phone came pretty quickly and was packaged safely. Would recommend this purchase.
yes,yes,yes,I got this as a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she loves it. The screen is beautiful. Battery life is significantly better than the S3 she switched from. Camera takes amazing pictures. The phone is very fast. Switching from her S3 to this took 5 minutes with boost mobile.
no,no,yes,Tried to activate this phone and was told I couldn't because another number was already activated to it. It was supposed to b my chistmas present
no,yes,no,Great phone but stopped charging within a few days. Returning for a replacement then I will re-rate.
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone...period.
yes,yes,yes,love it I'm so glad I bought it
yes,yes,yes,"Initially I was very pleased. I believed the phone was new and very nice. I found out I was unable to get wireless service through Boost Mobile. It's just a really expensive small computer. I am so disappointed, as well as frustrated."
yes,yes,yes,"I thought a lot before buying the phone because it was too expensive, but I am glad that I bought it. It is a very nice phone. It is more than I expected!"
no,yes,yes,my phone screen blanked out somebody help me now please I'm so upset like wth
yes,no,yes,kinda upset wish i would of saved my money or just got a iphone .
no,no,no,Phone was already activated and was unable to use.
yes,yes,yes,Love The S5! It's a great phone!
yes,yes,yes,"I had my reservations because of reviews about the ""cheap"" feel, and I do think my S3 felt better in your hand. The camera is AMAZING! I sell on eBay, and I use the S5 now as my camera to photograph listings."
yes,yes,yes,Galaxy S5 it works great... ;) Samsung ☆☆☆☆☆
yes,yes,yes,The battery is a lot better than the S3. The Boost service in Kansas City has been great. I would recommend.
yes,yes,yes,A bit disappointed in this one guys. Seems slow. . .battery life falls far far short of what they advertised. makes me miss my Blackberry even more - Sadness!
yes,yes,yes,Works wonderful
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone so far, but it needed sim card and didn't know that before ordering the phone. Oops! Very Satisfied."
yes,yes,yes,I've had 3 and the screens cracked very easily. Great phone otherwise.
yes,yes,yes,"Worked fine for a while, but developed screen issues."
yes,yes,yes,"Was actually champagne not white. Works well so far only minor cosmetic damage around the bottom, for the year of the phone so that's great."
no,yes,no,This phone never worked properly. Had to turn off then on just to make a call
no,yes,no,had for a week and stoppped being able to charge it . returned and exchanged
yes,yes,yes,"Overall performance is good. However, I constantly get messages to close the battery cover or the charging cover. Am wondering if anyone else has experienced this."
no,yes,no,Wish I never returned this!
yes,yes,yes,Had to get the charging port fixed everything else is ok
no,no,no,It runs good but now the screen is going. Sometimes i have to reset it to get the screen to turn on and if its on the low setting for the brightness the screen will flicker and change colors
yes,no,no,Big fiasco. .was orders by my wife as a gift. . Did not include sim. Guess the listing said that though. Phone got here and the sd reader didn't work. We messaged a few times.. Never fixed it . But I'm still using the phone. .just no storage.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I have ever had.
yes,yes,yes,Phone has been great charger had a short had to replace it
no,yes,yes,Was not compatible with Sprint Network as indicated in title and listing decription.
no,no,no,"Came with a bad charger port can hardly even charge it and i dont recommend it, only had the phone for 3 months and its got screen issues and many more issues."
yes,yes,yes,"Great condition , was easily hooked up and works great"
no,no,no,"The phone started acting up about 10 months after I got it. I had a problem with Samsung getting it repaired. Once it was supposed to have been repaired, it was not. The phone started having the same problems about 4 - 5 days, after I got it back. I had asked Samsung for a new phone."
yes,yes,yes,I am beyond disappointed with this. I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. The actual phone itself is great for the short time it worked. I liked how easy it was to use the fingerprint locking system and that its water proof and how easy it is to use.
no,yes,yes,Very good phone. I received it in mint condition. The only problem i have withy order was it came with a faulty charger.
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely no problems. The lack of a SIM card with the phone caused some frustration in getting one (had to go to Ebay to avoid paying over 20 dollars), but the phone itself is great."
no,yes,yes,Couldn't even tell that this phone was used before other than I didn't have to tear it out of the plastic.
no,yes,no,"The phone flickers and has many scratches, it SUCKS"
yes,yes,yes,Use this phone about 8-12 hours a day and running great!
yes,yes,yes,Does this phone have any heavy scratches on it
no,yes,yes,It did not come with the proper cable to charge the phone.
yes,no,yes,"The phone was in great shape,but the charger did not work"
no,no,no,"I was skeptical about buying this phone at first but decided to buy it anywaya.....this phone doesn't work well,people would be calling me and the phone doesn't even ring,i tried calling it with my house phn and it didn't ring either,this only happens sometimes tho..."
yes,yes,yes,Got it 3 days early awesome thank you so much
yes,yes,yes,"I am totally enjoying this phone and the update from Kitkat to Lollipop OS is amazing, I am giving it 4 stars because while going from a ROM of 4G to 16G was at first wonderful I am also aware that at some point I may have to consider available space when choosing what apps I download."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Speed and service excellent. Highly recommend the S5.
yes,yes,yes,"Got this for my girlfriend, she loves to take pics and this phone takes excellent pics."
yes,yes,yes,Came exactly as listed and it's what I'm using to maker this review months later.
yes,yes,yes,Was in great shape upon arrival. Had trouble with it disconnecting while transferring data onto it. But after looking at some forums i believe this is an issue with all of the galaxy phones
no,yes,no,"this is nicest phone I've ever owned...unfortunately, I have not had this phone for very long and it does not work. It started having a flickering screen so I looked up fixes and it stated to do a factory reset which I did. The phone just got worse and now it just goes black."
no,yes,yes,IT KEEPS TELLING ME I HAVE A BAD SIM CARD AND I ONLY GET 3G NOT 4G BUT IT' A BAD SIM CARD CONTINUOUSLY !!! Camera's awesome nice & clear pics. .......
yes,yes,yes,Moved to this from a note 2. A touch smaller but faster and better contrast make this a joy to use. Automatic upgrade to marshmallow was a nice surprise. Another unexpected bonus was water resistance. Great phone!
yes,yes,yes,I was an iPhone 4s and 5 user who recently decided to switch. I was nervous at first because I really did like my iPhone (but it gave me a lot of headaches and eye pain) but I have to admit I am GLAD I switched! Also Boost Mobile has GREAT service and speeds in my location.
yes,no,yes,"I have had all of the galaxy phones and this one is by far the best. The screen is great, videos and games come to life with such great picture quality. Charge lasts forever. Only downside is that the speaker (when you are talking) isn't the best, not the worst but it could be better."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone!!! just had to goto boost mobile to get a sim card but phone works without it!! just annoying seeing the no sim message lol
yes,yes,yes,"I have had it for a week. This phone replaced my (still working) S2. This is an awesome phone. The camera is amazing, I have better signal and much faster internet (when not on wifi) than I had with my S2."
yes,yes,yes,great phone had it 3 days and still don't have to charge it ( wow )
no,yes,yes,"DO NOT BUY THIS! It is not compatible with Boost Mobile like it states, and it took 3 days longer to receive package which is not the correct phone I ordered. Im very unsatisfied."
yes,yes,yes,THANK YOU! THE HEADLINE SAYS IT ALL
yes,yes,yes,Item as described.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone works great, just missing the SIM card.."
yes,yes,yes,"After a couple issues with activation, once I got it activated after about 2 hours it's working perfect! Love this phone."
yes,no,yes,No it wasn't as advertised.
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely love this phone. Amazing battery life. Practically indestructible even with my one year old. Waterproof from his drool and food makes it the perfect phone for me. Also love how bright it gets if the sun is bright and love how low the lighting gets when i dont want to squint and look at my...
yes,yes,yes,"The item showed up on time with no issues. Very good shipment, very good product."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone battery last all day.
yes,yes,yes,"So far, the only reason for 4 stars is the cost. This is the most expensive phone to date for me, but it's twice the phone I did have. I had read in previous comments that some were lucky enough to have bought it for alot less. I haven't tested out the waterproof feature yet."
no,no,no,I like my galaxy s5.The only reason why i did not give 5 stars is because somtimes people tell me to speak up louder because my voice going in and out. Somtimes they are unable to hear me clearly.
yes,yes,yes,Good phone i love it except it didnt come with sim card or icc id card it needs to get 4g then as i was putting my clear case on it the letter s in the middle slides off lol great quality Samsung i dont think its a real back cover to the samsung s5 but a replacement from else where other than that...
yes,yes,yes,I'm in love with the capabilities this has like the high speed ram. 8 megapixel on iPhone really? The galaxy is 16 megapixel of eye popping graphics
yes,yes,yes,"The cellphone is great but i can't give 5 stars bcoz the description said like knew but when i received the cellphone it has a big scratch on the screen, that doesn't meke it like knew."
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone ive ever had, everything works great"
no,yes,no,"The phone came without sim card, and the battery drained very quickly. I have to call my service company to get a new sin card."
no,no,yes,Had this phone for less than a year and the charging port broke.... Such a disappointment for such an expensive phone.
yes,no,yes,Great phone however I didn't realize I had to get a new sim card and then boost mobile forgot to activate so I had to call to get them to activate sim card to unlock sim card to get onto 4g lte network. The phone is awesome though!
yes,yes,yes,"Phone works great, I had no problems getting it set up with Virgin Mobile and it arrived at my door in a very timely fashion. Love that the phone gives me peace of mind with the water resistance as well as the different security features it has."
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone! About the only complaint I have is the sound. On calls it's sometimes hard to hear the person on the other end, especially in the car. And the speakerphone isn't much better. Other than that, pretty amazing phone! Good battery life too!"
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S5 is a beautiful piece of technology. I will not bore any of you with tech speak but I will say that the pictures are nice and crisp. I usually do not play around with the camera but found myself engrossed in it for a few hours.
yes,yes,yes,"The hardware is generally pretty nice: fast processors, great display, nice sound, good reception. But most of the features that make this phone a top-of-the-line phone are failures: the fingerprint reader is unreliable; the waterproofing requires fiddly little flaps; the heart rate monitor requires..."
yes,yes,yes,"As usual, everything was fine with delivery. Thank you."
yes,yes,yes,Grandson says it's too big and awkward.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is fanatic. I do wish it were a bit smaller, but i do love it. And it's water proof. Huge bonus. It charges super fast, in less than 2 hours and holds the charge all day. Highly recommend."
yes,yes,yes,Went from a Galaxy Reverb to the S5. Still playing with all the apps and figuring out how to use them all. Beautiful screen
yes,yes,yes,This is an excellent phone!!!
yes,yes,yes,love this phone...service not so good.
no,yes,yes,The charger port door fell off -.-
yes,yes,yes,"I love iiittttttttt! Let me start by saying I never, ever take the time out to make reviews. And since I enjoy typing so much on this phone. I figured what the heck. I haven't put this device down since it arrived at my door step, that was about 8 hours ago and I'm still at 43% battery."
yes,yes,yes,Just what I wanted. Thank you !
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I got this for a gift and they love it.
yes,yes,yes,works like the s3 with more features
yes,yes,yes,"Upgraded from the S3. Great phone--much faster processor, excellent battery life. My only gripes are losing scene modes with the camera (e.g. Fireworks, Candle light, etc.) and in low light, the screen is a bit dim for my taste so I have to adjust it manually."
yes,yes,yes,I LOVE THIS PHONE!
yes,no,yes,Awsome phone! Worth the bucks :-)
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome. With a quick call to Virgin to activate this phone i am more then pleased.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone! This phone is the best phone ive ever had! Im still finding things it does and I've had it for a few months already.....
yes,yes,yes,Phone arrived in 2 days! Love it and loved the price. Best price all around thanks
yes,no,yes,Its on virgin mobiles website for $499. Plus an extra $100 account credit when you sign up as a new member.
yes,yes,yes,"I might be able to get used to the size. Way to much Bloatware, both Samsung and Android. Maybe an iPhone next time."
yes,yes,yes,"The virgin mobile galaxy s5 is a awsome phone,im actually writing this review on it,the screen is very big on it,it get pretty good service in my area,its great quality phone,its a little expensive but the cost of virgin mobiles plans make it well worth the phone cost and irgin mobile has insurance..."
yes,yes,yes,You are the best. This item was great everything about the item is wonderful except I made a mistake when purchasing item. I must say i am in Jamaica and when my friend from the US get to Jamaica it was a prepaid phone in stead of a unlock phone.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is really thin and looks great...If you want the very best they have to offer in mobile phones then buy this phone...see my other reviews to see the best case and screen protector ;)
yes,yes,yes,"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST PHONE I HAVE EVER OWNED FROM VM (AND I HAVE PROBABLY HAD ABOUT 5 IN THE PAST FEW YEARS). THE PRICE IS PRETTY STEEP, BUT GIVING THAT IT IS ONE OF THE BEST PHONES OF 2014 AND ON A PREPAID CARRIER, IT IS EXPECTED."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! It has exceeded my expectations and was pretty easy to learn it's plethora of features.
yes,yes,yes,the bes phone out there. works like a charm
no,yes,yes,"This phone is so interactive, fun to use, big screen, and so on but it is a bit complicated to understand."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone just minor camera problems
yes,yes,yes,"At first, I was nervous because I had no idea what I was doing ...too much at once. After I calmed down and figured things out and set it up my way.....I'm ok. There is so much to learn, I am getting better each day. I love Samsung products."
yes,no,no,"I was mislead by the term ""Prepaid Phone"". It had nothing Prepaid about it. If you want a Galaxy S5 you can probably get a better deal elsewhere. I have since returned the Galaxy S-5 at my own expense."
yes,yes,yes,Work great easy set up
yes,yes,yes,"When I got this phone I fell in love. I have had Samsung Galaxy 2S and 3S and also owned a Iphone 4 and 5S. When I got the 5S I loved it. It is fast and a bad ass phone, but I don't like the size. It is too big. I thought the 3S was big, but the 5S is over the top huge."
no,yes,no,"The Galaxy S5 did not meet my expectations. I really wished I had kept my HTC Evo. The phone has the worst signal reception I have seen in any new device. Constant failed text messages and dropped calls, the phone only works properly in CDMA Only mode and that means no 4G."
yes,yes,yes,this phone has it all..i love it
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. A bit pricey but worth it
yes,yes,yes,"For the past 8 years I have used a Blackberry Curve. I like that phone but my wife kept telling me I needed a smart phone. I was reluctant to try a big phone but I love this phone. Fast, long battery life and with the addition of a 32gb chip, excellent storage."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone, it is a great upgrade from the Samsung Galaxy s3, faster, the battery is great. The only upset to me was the price dropped 50 dollars just a few days after I bought it, and returning it will be a huge hassle to install and set up the phone again!"
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. The battery life is just great. I like the fact that I don't have to charge it everyday like the S3. I am still learning about my phone. I set up the phone locator if my phone is ever lost. I use my fingerprint to unlock the phone. I am very happy with my purchase.
yes,yes,yes,upgraded from the S3 and love this phone.
yes,yes,yes,I got the 4G lite through Boost Mobile. I LOVE IT. It is worth the investment. It has numerous features on the phone that I know that I won't use but this one is a must have and I just upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy s2 to this Samsung Galaxy S5 it may be costly but it was well worth the purchase...
yes,no,yes,Phone has been working great for the past 24hrs. Ive only had it activated for that long. The only negative things i would say is it took way to long to ship; and when i bought the phone it said no sim card.
yes,yes,yes,charger cover plate fell off a week after I bought it
yes,yes,yes,"Did not come with a SIM Card, but still a great buy."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome! I replaced my Galaxy S3 with the S5 and I couldn't be happier. I love the newer features and I especially like the amount of battery life I still have at the end of the day. I had to charge my S3 several times a day.
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is the most intuitive and innovative smart phone. Its the best choice in todays market considering sales values are getting better. Great for family , friends and co-workers. i deeply recommend this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic, WAY better than the IPhone & good price"
yes,no,yes,"I bought the used one through bayshore deals. I know it said no sim card but I was unaware I needed a special one. I couldn't transfer the one from my old boost phone. Another thing is that they only included a regular usb 2.0 charger, not the usb 3.0 fast charging cable."
yes,yes,yes,"Love it. I brought the samsung galaxy s3 a month ago. Two weeks after having it, left it on the bus. Good luck getting that back in Brooklyn, New York. So...i said, the hell with it. I loved the s3 for the short time i had it, so i decided to bite the bullet and get the s5. This one..."
yes,yes,yes,So in love with this phone! Went from a s3 to this (s5) and ill admit its worth it.
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone i am still learning to use it i had a galaxy 2 i loved it had to have the 5 way better than a i phone it take the most beautiful pictures i luv this
no,yes,no,This is a good phone definitely an update from my S2. I was unsure if everytime the battery cover announcement pops up if it means that it's not closed properly but it stopped doing it so frequently so i think it's good.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. I honestly could not be happier. It runs smoothly and it truly is water and dust resistant. Samsung did a wonderful job. And its worth every penny.
yes,yes,yes,"Overall, I love this phone. I am still discovering features that it has. The camera on this phone is top notch. The size and the weight of the phone are good. The only problem that I have had is short battery life, and for some reason it did not like my 32GB SD card."
yes,yes,yes,"It's got a lot of bells and whistles that you will never really use in your day to day life, such as the NFC file transfer or the heart rate monitor. Other features such as multiple app windows and smart pause don't work well enough to be more than a novelty."
no,no,yes,I've had this phone for over two months now and I love it. My previous phone was a HTC EVO 3D 4G and I kept running out of space for my apps and it felt slow. This phone feels really fast no matter how many apps I've opened recently.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I've switched to T-Mobile and got the same phone with them as well
yes,yes,yes,This is one of the best phone offered on the market. It's a perfect size where it doesn't feel like a phablet. The camera is the biggest selling point on this phone. The camera can easily replace any point and shoot camera and does well in the dark which past phones (like the iPhone) have struggled.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone so far. Battery and camera don't live up to my expectations, but the unit as a whole has been working great for me so far. (about 6 months now) There has been an issue getting it to properly connect with my vehicle blue tooth unit (it always receives calls through the unit, but outgoing..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone! Got the old phone (LG Optimus Elite) switched out on VirginMobile via thier web site with no issues using the ""swap phone"" option. It went through a few updates and then was good to go. Very fast and responsive."
yes,yes,yes,I really do love this phone. The battery is really good. That was one of the main reasons I wanted it. Right now it's 5pm and I've used my phone all day and I am at 73%. It also has ultra power saving mode that works. It's very quick and the screen is very bright and clear.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone about 2 months ago now which is almost as long as the phone has been out for Virgin Mobile. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this phone. It is a definite upgrade from the S3, and I like the feel of it better than the S4, (but the S4 isn't an option from Virgin...)."
yes,yes,yes,Great product from samsung used for more than a year withou any problem.main problem is the rear lens cover it got dust inside.when clicking pictures it gives black dots in images.
yes,yes,yes,"really superb mobile from samsung.... i awaited this type of mobile only... 20 x zoom camera quality super with photos or videos... display , clarity and impossible phone from this type of 20k... earlier i used many phones mega,s4,sony t2 ultra... but all this phone not compare with this phone..."
yes,yes,yes,"i awaited this type of mobile only... 20 x zoom camera quality super with photos or videos... display , clarity and impossible phone from this type of 20k... earlier i used many phones mega,s4,sony t2 ultra... but all this phone not compare with this phone... all functions work amazing..."
yes,yes,yes,"So, so a good product!"
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone at a reasonable price. Seller sent it quickly and arrived right on time. Very happy
yes,yes,yes,"Works perfectly, the description of this item was accurate, shipped earlier than expected date, I've had no problems with it."
yes,yes,yes,"Love it, this phone is a great deal. I bought it as a upgrade from my older Metro PCs phone & love it. The camera quality is awesome & the screen resolution is vivid. Galaxy phones are always my go to, cause I know my satisfactory will be always be met."
yes,no,yes,Came in good condition with bary a blemish.
yes,yes,yes,As a gift to my technologically inept mother this was a great gift. Works like a charm and have heard no complaints thus far. She did mention something about battery life but what android battery doesn't suck? A new battery is pennies compared to what the original phone would have cost us.
yes,yes,yes,"I wanted to get a new phone but i didnt know which one to get because the s7 was coming out. So I decided to wait awhile intill all the rumors of the s7 were true. Turns out i leaned on getting the s5 because this phone has a removable back, ir blaster, sd support, fingerprint scanner, and it has a..."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S5 is indisputably the best phone around. Packed with features, lightning fast, a fantastic display, it is simply amazing. I bought it for my husband as a surprised present, and he is on cloud nine ever since."
yes,yes,yes,I went from the LG Motion 4G to this phone and I'm so glad I did. This phone is unbelievable. 5 stars all the way!
no,no,yes,"It didn't bring headphones, the original charger, and the box it originally comes in :'("
yes,yes,yes,I love it! This is a really great phone! Finger print security-related technology and an ability to take my heart rate on demand are some of the nice features that make this phone awesome! Also the voice acting a Ted demands work really well.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone had the galaxy mega....another great phone but needed latest updates...only complaint is this phone is expensive..great camera
yes,no,yes,Perfect my husband really enjoys his new Samsung galaxy 5 .
yes,yes,yes,Bought as a gift... It is indeed impressive.
yes,yes,yes,The cellphone is excellent. The first days it was super fast. Now I have almost a month with it and sometimes when I am texting it gets freeze like for 1/2 sec and then it continues texting... Also there are moments that it overheats a little bit and I have to stop using it.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, does everything!"
yes,yes,yes,So far doing great.
yes,yes,yes,"All you would expect from a top-of-the-line Android phone. I chose the Galaxy 5 over the 6 because I wanted to use my SD card, and I wanted to replace the battery when it gets low of charge. Metro pcs offers a real unlimited data/talk plan (no throttled speed) for $60/mo."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone, but I do not believe its an original samsung phone but maybe an international version. The camera has no special options or choice of settings. You can not take close ups as with the origal samsung. So if you are a picture taker then I would not recommend this product."
yes,yes,yes,"The s5, I won't get into many details but so far the phone has been working well. I found that for the price the camera quality is not so great. Maybe it's just me. I prefered the S4 camera. I did find that the camera has many great features like the scenery."
yes,yes,yes,I got the phone new and it is really good but a bit of warning the bit that covers the charging port seems like it could break off at any moment it somehow bent so it is worrying me. I have no complaints on this phone it is really great.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is even better than I expected, I love it and it was in great condition for the price."
yes,yes,yes,This phone.. is the best... hands down..
yes,yes,yes,"Ok. I waited to write a review because I wanted to give it some time. First off. I literally washed my phone in a full washing cycle soap and all. Yesterday. Oops! My phone survived!!!!!!! I can't believe it. If u are worried about water damge, this phone is your best bet. Unbelievable!"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Arrived just as described and when promised. I would definitely do business with vendor again. My son is happy as a clam - can play Pokemon with his friends now!!
yes,yes,yes,"I don't understand what all the hype is about with the iPhone retina display, but it is no where comparable to the Samsung Galaxy S5 beautiful design, color saturation, and very responsive screen.There are a lot of features such as infrared remote sensor and apps that connects us with the world."
yes,yes,yes,Pros- 1. Beautiful display. 2. Great performance. 3. Battery life has been improved. 4. Improved design. 5. Premium camera with lots of features. Cons- 1. The interface still feels cluttered. 2. A lot of bloatware and redundancy. 3. Only 16 GB of internal storage.
yes,yes,yes,"Be cautious... I bought the product that was leblled as ""NEW"". Well technically the phone was new but here are the issues.... 1. First of all these are demo pieces. I have attached some images. What does this mean for customer ?"
no,yes,no,"This phone has been nothing but trouble since a few months after I got it. It started freezing, auto-opening apps, closing apps that I was using (such as Google maps while I was using it to navigate), distorting my lock screen so that there were no numbers visible anymore, etc."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is cool. My S3 was perfect and I would have held onto it for a lot longer if the power button hadn't gone out on me (had it a little more than 2yrs). The only thing that has really been an upgrade for me is the quick view for texting, no need for a third party app."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm a self-admitted phone nut, and I've carried around a Nexus 4, Galaxy S4, Galaxy S4 Active, HTC One, HTC One M8, and iPhone 5S over the past year. I don't have a very strong allegiance to operating system or brand."
yes,yes,yes,"So glad I upgraded. Much much faster than the S3. Compared to the S3: Apps snap open; Windows slide smoothly; Calls are made and answered instantaneously. Battery life is also noticeably better. The size is bigger, but that's a minor tradeoff in my book."
yes,no,yes,"If you're looking for a phone that's new and and gets the job done, the Samsung Galaxy s6 is the best for you. With a new look and new interphase, Samsung has made a phone that stands out from the rest. The s6 shows that this company can still compete with the Apple iPhone line."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy s6, very nice and very good Service, Battery seaport have and Networking seaport,................ thank you for Samsung Galaxy mobile"
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is great in my opinion. And ever after using it for more than one year and two months, it gets the job done. I am a heavy user and the only thing I didn't like is the battery back up. Waiting for the nougat update."
no,yes,yes,"I've had my S6 for about 1year 4months. Still very fast, no noticeable slow down at all. I haven't gotten Marshmallow yet, but it can only come with improvements such as doze, which will increase the battery life (which is dreadful)."
no,no,yes,non removable battery is being common but still when new os updates comes after the first one there will be many lags and major shutdown and freezing issues so it will lay on black screen either on or off atleast not able for go to android recovery and all.hence either the updates should be...
yes,yes,yes,awesome phone nd but still my s6 SM-g920I not receive the nougat 7.0 update
yes,yes,no,"Does not have video enhancer, always on display which is present on galaxy s7 and samsung galaxy a7 and a5 2017 series too which feels bad. Samsung s6 should consist these features .samsung should need to roll out update for these features in future otherwise why to buy a flaghip phone"
yes,no,yes,"the samsung galaxy s6 is one of the best phons on the market Like any smartphone, the Galaxy S6 isn’t without compromise,its battery life is seriously disappointing, and it’s an open question how well the sometimes shaky software will age over time."
yes,no,yes,I was ios user for last couple of years & never wants to migrate to samsung due to bad design and performance.But i purchased it after its launching & S6 delievers the best performance i have ever seen on andriods..However it lack behind behind in terms of battery.
yes,yes,yes,good condition and features are also best. camera quality also good. i recommended
yes,yes,yes,Nice running excellent performance. But low battery life i have no option of(Software) in my settings...
yes,yes,yes,Everything is good. .. just concerned little about battery life
yes,yes,yes,Easy to use and the device is fast too.slight lag is there sometime .the camera is great for outdoor shooting.the display is too good.and a good gaming device
yes,yes,yes,Specs are superb and does not heats up with heavy usage. A value for money phone.
yes,yes,yes,I find it very fast and many options inside .. I tried S7 edge but I find no difference except the big screen
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone, wonderful build quality, 2k display, great camera, the UI speed really are really good, but there messed it up with one thing, the battery! A Flagship with 2.550 mAh battery capacity, Samsung, WTF?"
no,no,no,After only 2 weeks of using the phone (hard things like speaking and using it on the Internet) and suddenly the fingerprint was not working any more and soon after the phone couldn't connect to available network.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy S6 is one of the most amazing smartphone. It is having multiple advance features and offers more user friendly interface. Camera is fantastic and the display is awesome. The phone is very light which makes it very easy to carry.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is extraordinary with respect to display, performance and features. Wireless & Fast Charging are excellent features to applaud. Only recommendation would be a larger battery though fast charging compensates this for time being. Good Job Samsung. After note 2, I am again liking Samsung."
yes,no,yes,the battery life is not as good and truly ram usage is always above 59% but its performance is of a beast. After the price drop its an easy decision. It feels great in hands awesome display.
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S6 is a well-designed and well made, with quality materials. Galaxy S6 has best-in-class camera, beautiful display, I think it's the best smartphone on the market today so I am recommend Galaxy S6."
yes,yes,yes,Osm product... Really nice product except battery perfect product... working good
yes,yes,yes,There are no performance issue. The only problem is with the unexpenbadle storage and battery should have been a bit bigger. Inspite of these the phone works really very good. Just buy it.
no,no,yes,I m using s6 but it is heating much more than s5(my previous phone).so i don't recommend to buy.
yes,no,yes,All is one and all feature in this device best performance and good processing.
yes,yes,yes,"A perfect device with class quality of look, feel and performance. Interface and multi app view is awesome. Performance of processor is unbeatable. Glass and metal body with deep penetrative views when exposed to sunlight is where you feel the power of your Samsung S6."
yes,yes,yes,thank you Samsung am so happy with your product. I wish to have a every product of yours. am so happy with your Samsung galaxy s6.
yes,yes,yes,Color gold platinum is great. Wireless chrging inbuilt. Infra remote sensor cool. All accessories for this phone are available at decent prices.
yes,no,yes,"Everything is perfect except the battery and no MicroSD Card slot. The battery only last 4-10 hours on Heavy and regular usage. Probably because the leaked RAM, hope samsung fix it in marshmallow update."
yes,yes,yes,Features I recommend you to buy S6 and it is very user friendly. Amazing performance
yes,yes,yes,I've been using this for 6 months (It's February 2016 now) and this is the best smartphone that you could buy for the price

yes,yes,yes,Samsung hats off to you....I Just love you Guys! I just buy a s6 and I am so satisfied! !!THANKYOU
yes,yes,yes,the phone is aweosme with all features but only one negative is battery dies soon samsung should consider about battery life
yes,yes,yes,"A really beautiful and powerful phone. This has to be one of Samsung's best phones if not the best. Great display, superb camera. Very good performance. The only downside is the battery life which could have been better. Overall a great experience good work Samsung"
yes,yes,yes,"Ok so its been 5 months since im using this phone and I can say that this is the best smartphone you can get right now.It gives you some world -class perfomance,Stunning Visuals,Great Multitasking,The worlds best camera performance In short it gives amazing all round performance.The only..."
yes,yes,yes,"It's been many years since my last Samsung device. I love the hardware design of the S6 and the features are rich. But, the battery life barely makes it through 8 hours even with all the recommended adjustments to increase the life."
yes,no,yes,30% battery down in just 2 hour... need more improvement
yes,yes,yes,i am using Samsung S6 before 2month i am face hing the Battery Problem not satisfied this Phone and i am not recommend and friends and family group. and i am send my all social networking group S6 mobile negative feedback.
yes,no,yes,"I cannot understate how disappointed I am in Samsung for passing this fraudulent product on the consuming public. No removable battery or SD card slot (like in previous models), a smaller battery with practically no battery life (worse than any previous smartphone I have owned), and a design with..."
no,no,no,"Unfortunately smart manager in my S G 920G doesn't work. From day one, it shows memory as full, eventhough in settings, it shows ample available space. I am not able to take or download even a single photo. Is there anything wrong with settings?"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is great in every single aspect, including touchwiz which hasn't caused any lags thankfully!yet I still have my own complaints.Very high unexplained ram usage.pretty weird for a 3gb ram phone. Battery life could have been better,hoping updates could fix this"
yes,yes,yes,"amazing phone i like it .amazing front camera,software,desigh many more..."
yes,yes,yes,"One of the best phones I have ever seen, phone is really fast has a great capacity, it will be better if it has a microsd slot so that one can have his/her personal stuff more safe, and the other thing is that the battery drains quickly."
yes,yes,yes,"I must say that this phone is absolutely great, big step from S5, in terms of design, camera, function, speed, display.Samsung did great job.I love this phone so much.Honestly, i love Apple products, i love how they are operating, very good hardwer/softwer balance, very optimized, they are not..."
yes,yes,no,"It amazes me that so many folks rate highly about this phone when its one of the worst phones from a user experience. On paper its a beast but in the real world I get more speed from throwing rocks. I found some pleasant things about this device, like the screen and build quality."
yes,yes,yes,"I have used may Samsung phones but after S3 this is something which one should definitely experience. the looks are killer, Hoping performance will remain good for long."
yes,no,yes,I am incredibly impressed with this phone. Got so much features.
yes,yes,yes,"Near perfect phone, but not quite. Battery could be bigger. TouchWiz needs more trimming down. The screen is the best mobile screen. Amazing sharpness and detail (not like the 326ppi ones). Excellent colour calibration and white balance. The camera is incredible."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had this phone for about 3 months now and i am in love with it. it fast, very responsive, the camera is amazing and the screen is just ridiculously sharp and beautiful. over all the best phone i ever had and yes i think its better that the iphone 6s, my mom have it and i played with it couple..."
yes,yes,yes,"Build is good but grip is slippery. Display excellent. Touch response is excellent. Battery life average. Ram mgt inadequate. Radio, MHL and DLNA sorely missed. Touchwiz avg. One would expect that the flagship model would have the best in class features. Disappointing."
yes,yes,yes,"Overall excellent phone, only thing which needs improvement is battery."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is good. Let us leave aside the cries for expandable memory and removable battery. It would be better to take a look at an issue which affects all samsung phones and should definitely be addressed: RAM management.
yes,yes,yes,The screen is extremely good the camera makes wonderful pictures and it makes videos in 4K quality what is extremely sharp the processor is also really powerful it is also really light and feels good when you have it in your hands!
yes,yes,yes,"A very lovely phone from Samsung. Finally samsung managed to build a true flagship phone. Build quality = superb. Screen = don't ask, you have to see it yourself. Processor and s**t = i don't care. UI = i like touchwiz. I can't see why many people despise it. Customisability = it's Android."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 is by far one of the best smartphones to buy on the current market. Boasting a 5.1 High Definition display, it has the best screen resolution of any current phone available."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone Samsung have ever produced, amazing camera and display backed up class leading performance. The camera produces some of the best images I've seen from a phone, the speed in which you access the camera application and take images is very quick."

yes,yes,yes,"Verry satisfied. Amazing smartphone. Recomand! I have until now iPhone 4s, 5s, Samsung S3, S4, S5 and now S6. Incomparable with all. I think rapport price quality its the best comparative with concurence. The other smartphones is more expensive. Very good camera and preformance"
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone ever. Beautyful glass on back. Gorilla Glass 4 very strong. Powerful Exynos 7420 procssesor with 70,600 on AnTuTu. Very good TouchWiz 5.1.1 version of android. New icons are great. Best camera ever put on a smartphone. 5.1 inch of perfection."
yes,yes,yes,Little slippery but ..overall quite satisfied..body of phone needs to be lil no slippery...camera and all specs are awsum...
yes,yes,yes,unbeatable performance awesome camera display is just best in the world .577ppi which is not in any phone
yes,yes,yes,"Anybody can tell you how nice this phone feels in the hand, but you have to touch it and that sensation will stay in your mind for the rest of the day. Amazing display. Very bright, you can surf the internet in direct sunlight without any problems."

yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone for everyday usage as well as for any type of user. The screen is great for either games and videos, the camera is feature rich and great at any situation. The UI has been refined into a much smoother one, while keeping many features that I value on Samsung phones."
no,no,yes,"Lot of options has missing like, 1) Touch key light control option, 2) Video call facility on my phone contacts 3) Camera sound on/off option 4) Can't come in 1st page instantly from last page of apps menu. Like this etc...."
no,yes,no,samsung should now pay attention to its is software even touchwiz is proved to be laggy even aftr having 3gb of ram... please fix ram issue n other thing i cant unistall my whatsapp thats really rubish ....
yes,yes,yes,The best Galaxy Smartphone from Samsung. Biggest features are the display and the camera. The design and build quality are also at the maximum. Cons is in my opinion the battery but for normal usage it is fine for 1day.
yes,yes,yes,I GOT SAMSUNG S6 AFTER USING I PHONE. FOR BUSSINESS N ADVANCED USE IT IS FAR BETTER THAN I PHONE. CAMERA IS BEST PART ND OPERATING SPEED OF SOFTWARE IS FASTEST . I LOVE S6
yes,yes,yes,I have had this phone since the 31st of August and I absolutely love it. The phone is super fast with lightning fast speeds. Battery could be better but is still good. The display is a complete monster. The best display of all phones. It almost looks like the S3 but just a little different.
yes,yes,yes,Hi using Samsung s6 edge..feel me proud to use this product with amazing features

yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone Samsung have ever produced, amazing camera and display backed up class leading performance. The camera produces some of the best images I've seen from a phone, the speed in which you access the camera application and take images is very quick."

Ex- charged to 100%. It's 2hrs later I played one 3min video and the battery is at 86%. And its speaker. Crackly at max volume."
yes,yes,yes,"Overall great phone, I have no big complaints so fa, execpt for the battery getting quite hot after being plugged in for a short amount of time. I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Galaxy s6 and would reccomend it to anyone looking for a premium handheld device."
yes,yes,yes,"This is phone is absolutely amazing, the specs are top notch, the display is crisp and bright as hell, the camera is blazing fast and exceptionally good in almost every condition, even in low light."
yes,yes,yes,"Best Samsung phone by look, access but price is littlebit higher."
yes,yes,yes,"I think is the best mobile phone. The only bad is the battery which,with very very huge usage,last 5-7 hours.Luckily it has really fast charging plus wireless. best phone in the market................................"
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 is by far one of the best smartphones to buy on the current market. Boasting a 5.1 High Definition display, it has the best screen resolution of any current phone available."
yes,yes,yes,"its really good, actually is one of the best devices I ever had (i had a iphone 6plus, sony experia z, SGS3, iphone4, Note 4, 3 , 2) this one in particular it is really awesome, the camera the camera is a thing that i used everyday and i can't complain is really awesome, the thing is the battery,..."

yes,yes,yes,excellent smartphone to buy in todays time with marvelous features in very reasonable price.
yes,yes,yes,Using s6 edge is better then using i phone 6 it is the toppest phone now
yes,yes,yes,Expecting more.....and from value to be less.....!!!!!!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,The best phone on the market! Samsung is the only phone I will ever buy!
yes,yes,yes,My first Samsung phone and I love it! I've played around with an S4 and S5 before but their performance and user experience was quite bad (for me at least) and they had lots of bloatware .
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is handsome and well made. It's slippery, thanks to the glass all around and it is a fingerprint magnet, which sours things a bit. You're going to be compelled to buy a case, which makes you wonder why Samsung opted to use a glass back in the first place."
yes,yes,yes,I was puzzled a lot between the samsung s6 and the htc m9+ which were both good on spec if you do a comparison on gsmarena. Here's the reason why I chose S6:nn1. Camera: Clearly the better of the two. Samsung has had a history of good camera's and it doesn't disappoint. n2.
yes,yes,yes,"The looks are nice, sleek phone with a state of the art camera. But I would like these features if I am to buy a samsung high end smartphone 1. User Removable battery as batteries are bound to wear down after 3 or 4 years of usage 2."
yes,no,yes,A very good smartphone But the battery backup is less
yes,yes,yes,Don't know thats corning gorilla glass 4 or a simple glass as gorilla glass doesn't get scratches easily overall everythings good
yes,yes,yes,"This is my third phone from the Galaxy S series..and the S6 doesn't disappoint(much).I really love the new design among other things as well as the theming options.As a user of Sony,Samsung and Apple devices I have to say that this is a massive step-up(and a little step back) for Samsung and I'm..."
yes,yes,yes,"It has great design, good built, nice features. Only thing I didnt like about it is the UI and Loud speaker placement."
yes,yes,yes,"Just bought Galaxy S6 two days ago...and i must say Samsung has done a great job with the S6 , i really like the design , Display is amazing , just blown away by the display , speed of processor is great , Camera is one of the best i ever used on a phone.."
yes,yes,yes,"i love this phone, idk why i choose this phone to replace my iPhone 5s. a lot of people around me are talking about this next big thing. i need a new phone that runs Android, and i decided to take this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Overall, I can only say good S6 and beautiful, as my analysis suggests, it works very well at all and does what it promises, the battery could be a bit stronger, radio was to bring, and battery should be removable , since the card is not possible to use SD Card, but sufficient 32GB."
no,no,no,"Serious let-down for such an expensive and hyped-up phone. Slow, unresponsive, frustrating OS, hazy bad color photos, LOADED with bloatware that can't be uninstalled, absolute worst text prediction I've ever used."
yes,yes,yes,Best phone ever from Samsung. I purchased the 128GB White model. Slim design. UAG cases are the only cases I purchase. Holds phone tight. Fast response. I have no idea how Samsung can best this phone. SD card. I have used one in years. Cloud storage or micro USB thumb drive. Cards are for wimps.
yes,yes,yes,"amazing phone with beautiful metal and glass body, simple design, fast, easy and simple UI, very very very amazin rear camera with various improvements, also front camera with beatiful colors. really it is amazing phone.. good jop sam."
yes,yes,yes,Last phone i bought was the s2 when it first came out which was exceptional. I finally decided to upgrade even thought the s2 still ran perfectly without any problems till this date. The s6 looks like it carries the spirit of the s2 and is amazingly built all around.
yes,no,yes,Samsung S6 are from the moment best smartphone Better Processor Of SnapDragon Better Display From Samsung Amoled From The Moment Samsung S6 Are Better From Iphone 6 And Other Name Company To Reals New Iphone 6s or 7 No Chance To Samsung S6 To Be Better That Iphone 6s or 7
yes,yes,yes,"it is currently the best flagship smartphone among the likes of htc one m9, lg g4,sony xperia z4...it delivers great performance but its gpu is good not great as adreno series. it also has an quick charge feature."
no,yes,yes,Please add one more feature to this phone...we can minimise or off the camera or phone screen after opening camera..
no,yes,yes,"according to price phone not up to the mark..battery drain with in 7/8 hours...screen resolution stated QHD but not look like that...think before buying guys,,,"
yes,yes,yes,"display is good,camera is good,but battery life is poor"
yes,yes,yes,"I like the phone but I think I loved the S5 more. I would like to see in the upgrade more options on the alarm settings (there is only one setting for the snooze), whistle notification & the travel wallpaper lockscreen."
yes,no,yes,"After 2, yes 2 bouts with the S6 Edge I tried this one. I was already down on the S6 because of the dual side glass design. Along with the extinction of the sd card slot and removable battery. As with the Edge this one had the same performance flaws."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is so far the best phone I have ever used. It beats every other phone out there in almost every category such as processor, display, camera, etc. It also has a lot of extra features such as the fingerprint scanner, heart rate sensor, Samsung Pay that works with all credit card readers,..."
yes,yes,yes,I bought samsung galaxy s6 yesterday....Samsung Galaxy s6 have amazing feture..but price is so high...among all series of Samsung the Galaxy s6 is the best mobile phone..
yes,yes,yes,"I'd like to share my review and experiences with the Samsung Galaxy S6 for AT&T. I consider myself an above average user. The Galaxy S6 is a really good phone and possibly the best Android phone you can currently buy. There are a few issues that really pull it back from being ""the"" phone to buy."
yes,no,yes,"A new age has come, this phone looks better, works better, and is better than anything on the market. The only phone that may be better is the s6 edge. It is fast, sleek, perfect. They may have copied Apple and HTC by using metal, but it looks and feels better than them both."
yes,no,yes,Everyone who is all upset over the non removable battery and no expandable memory needs to stop. Samsung made a bold choice to follow Apple's lead in offering a next gen phone with the features people actually care for. Those surveys they have you fill out actually went to use with this one.
yes,no,yes,"Samsung copied the iPhone as closely as they could with this version and the S7 is bound to make it even more iPhone-like. However, TouchWiz still lags sometimes and the lack of removable battery and no SD card make this a weak contender compared to other flagships like the G4."
yes,yes,yes,Amazing smart phone wonderful performance looks crazy body very much slim compare to IPhone
yes,yes,yes,oh my god it is best ever smartphone really I recommend this phone to everyone plz purchase it ... i also going to store right now ...love u samsung..
yes,yes,yes,It's features are better than others and awesome but I don't like it's design you have to give it a look of a7 because a7 is awesome stunning look I ever seen in mobiles
yes,yes,yes,"This phone packs a punch. I bought it through pre-ordering and have been using this phone since last 2 weeks. I was thrilled. The screen, responsiveness, battery life - all is just amazing. Coupled with it the turbo charger charges the phone from 0 to 100% in 1.2 hours flat."
yes,no,yes,"I've owned a Galaxy S3, S5, and now the S6. The S6 definitely outperforms the others. I don't mind losing the removable back or the Snapdragon chip. I did notice in my previous phones that they would get very warm with limited use. This one, however, I have had no overheating issues with."
yes,yes,yes,"Very satisfied with Galaxy S 6! Fast, Smart, Well designed! And I guess it is also ""long-living"", as all my previous Samsung phones! Thank you, Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,Couldnt think of such a stunning look phone from Samsung... Goodbye to the plastic boxes... People used to keep away from Samsung only because of that... Seriously amazing look... But some more features could be added... Battery is a serious concern.... Hardly 8 hrs even in a normal use...
no,yes,yes,Everything is good except battery drain. Email sync taking the 50 to 60% of the battery. I configured 3 Hotmail accounts.
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy S6 edge is a fantastic top-end smartphone that is ideal for anyone looking to have a head-turner in their hands. Though the edge skimps on function, it makes the device very, very high on style."
no,no,no,Worst battery life just 5 hours doing not good and i dont do haeavy work on phone but it goves appor backup
no,no,no,Worst battery life just 5 hours doing not good and i dont do haeavy work on phone but it goves appor backup
yes,yes,yes,The Best of Samsung.If you have the Budget dont wait go for it
yes,yes,yes,"The good things in galaxy s6 are touch calibration, curved design n camera. The bad things (comparing galaxy s5) are USB port version 2.0, finger sensor, water resistant feature, non-micro SD slot. In the end its a best buy."
yes,yes,yes,I only has iphones for the last 4 years so I was planning on purchasing the IPhone 6. I waited few weeks to compare the two phones and man I am really glad I waited. This phone by far exceeds any phones I had or seen.
yes,yes,yes,"DESIGN AND DISPLAY:nA beautiful and bold design by SAMSUNG, It’s only once you pick it up that you grasp its significance – the reality that this is like no Samsung that’s come before. It is slim sandwich of glass and aluminum, 6.8mm thick and very lightweight at 138g."
yes,yes,yes,In this smart phone camera has much better clarity
yes,yes,yes,I think this the best witch was introduced in the new Samsung it was more spical gud to use
yes,yes,yes,Especially camera and long battery life fast charging
yes,yes,yes,"Great Technology, Worthy for Money that we Spend.. ."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy S 6 are very good smart phone. All products accomplish a unic company Samsung Samsung takes me. Samsungs smartphone does not have the technology to the people. S6 overall smartphone Galaxy are cool. No doubt. Samsung keep it up
yes,yes,yes,"It is worth buying and great overall product , relevant , awesome user interface."
yes,yes,yes,but just want to know that whether it is dust and water resistant or not
yes,yes,yes,Its a gud.....this is a very useful model for smart guys....cooooooool
yes,yes,yes,Phone is very good &#42; Need to correct Right view image of Blue color preview as there is error in image (camera should be only one side)
yes,yes,yes,I love the new system of not receiving calls feature
yes,yes,yes,"Missing must haves&#58; Micro SD cards - By just having more internal storage, without a micro SD card option, a smartphone is not complete. It helps to easily swap the files. FM Radio -- Not sure about the rest of the world and what samsungs survey says about the usage of FM radios in phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Galaxy s6 is a masterpiece supermodel in mobile history and industry this year. I am planning to have I phone 6 but galaxy s6 beats every models in terms of design, sleekness, camera, processor, lollipop os, light weight + android lover thrill remains the same. Great job done by Samsung team."
yes,yes,yes,Still learning the features I love the idea that you can video call!! Granddaughter out west makes it so nice
yes,yes,yes,"Has a lot of nice features. And 128GB is a lot of space. The battery sucks though, and the camera could be a bit better. But overall I like it a lot."
no,yes,yes,Both breaks easy freezes up glitches alot sound isn't the best
yes,yes,yes,So glad I listened to my brother and bought Samsung phone. He said it was user friendly and helpful wasn't kidding! It offers so many features and options that my old iPhone 4 doesn't. The battery stays charged much longer than my old iPhone.
yes,yes,yes,Not much you can't do with this phone. Plus it great for the pocket.
yes,yes,yes,Easy yo assess phone apps. Picture quality is great
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung S6 has been a great phone for me so far. It has never failed on me. The software is Android and runs smoothly on the S6. The camera is amazing- quality is unreal. One downside is the inability to add external memory. You lose some, you win some."
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely love it best thing i got I would recommend it to all my friends
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone a week ago on January 6th 2016 and I like the way I could transfer all my stuff from my old galaxy s4 without taking the back off the new phone. It looks good but it is slippery feeling. Now I'm waiting on my case to arrive. But overall real nice.
yes,yes,yes,I've had the phone for about 2 weeks but seems to be working pretty good. Better reception than my last phone.not too bad navigating around the features
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is easier to use than my two previous smart phones , both HTC ONEM8GRY."
yes,yes,yes,"I really really love it! It is fast, fancy, totally awesome, except for the battery life is the perfect phone for modern life"
yes,yes,yes,My daughter puts it to use for any and everything.
yes,yes,yes,Not only recommend but bought one for my wife!!! We now own several Samsung items and couldn't be happier.
yes,yes,yes,"Easy to use, and great features ! Love the color. The apps. Are great"
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone ever. Takes great videos and photos. I would recommend this phone to friends and family.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is beautiful, and I love the camera. Everything about it is sophisticated in general and the design is magnificent, but the hardware is lacking. My phone crashes unexpectedly all of the time (my apps, usually, which doesn't happen to an old smart phone I have that's a different brand), the..."
yes,yes,yes,"great phone with great features. The only con I have so far---I have hade the phone for 4 days and the screen chipped and cracked. I didn't drop it, I think I may have sat it down to hard on my marble top counter, that's the only thing I can think that may have happened."
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned a Samsung III for 6 years now and needed a new phone, so I had no hesitation in choosing the Samsung phone again. I just love the easy use and everything about it. My daughter likes my phone so much, she's actually going to purchase the same one. Thank you"
yes,yes,yes,over all i love the phone but i wish it the screen didn't break easily from eye level.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. The screen is large and the color is excelent. Photos are crisp. Text message keyboard is very user friendly and easy to use. I love everything about this phone. No problems. I had an IPhone before this and did not like it.
yes,yes,yes,"Where do I start, I've owned a lot of phone's n my day and I was always a IPhone person. My mom talked me into getting a android phone, so I went out and bought the Samsung S6. Well let's just say the iPhone went into the trash and this is by far the best phone I've ever owned."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm not a Hi-Tech guy, this product is simple to use with more features then I will ever utilize It came loaded with apps, The camera on it has great resolution and a really fast processor, I really enjoy the split screen feature with makes surfing a lot quicker."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great in most aspects. The battery life is TERRIBLE. I charge it every day (sometimes twice a day). At night it sits on my dresser because I use the alarm and it goes down 8%. The battery charges quickly, but it would be nice if it lasted once charged. Other than that, a good phone"
yes,yes,yes,"I switched over from an Iphone 4 to this phone last year as it was time for an upgrade, At first I struggled with the obvious diffrences between an android and iphone but quickly adjusted. My main complaint with this phone is the fact that the battery life isn't very good."
yes,yes,yes,"I just couldn't justify paying an extra $400 for the Galaxy S7, so I went with the S6. I absolutely love it .Better than the iPhone 6S in almost every aspect. The image stabilization is very welcomed, and the camera is fantastic."
yes,yes,yes,"At first, i thought it was a mistake to make the switch from my S5, several useful touchwiz functions disappeared, but the more I use it, the better it is. Marshmallow update made it even better. great battery life. The only downfall is storage space, Should have gotten the 64gb version"
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone ever, great battery live, fabulous camera quality, size is fantastic not too big neither too small. Great Phone. Go Samsung Go!!!"
yes,yes,yes,i upgraded to the Samsung galaxy S6 three months ago best phone I have ever had!
yes,yes,yes,Pros: 1. Excellent screen (even in sunlight) 2. Excellent Camera quality and startup time 3. Amazing sound quality for wired and wireless 4. Build quality 5. Excellent GPU (game and video render beautifully) 6. Themes store for customizing the interface 7. Quick charge 2.0 is a life saver.
yes,yes,yes,This phone performs amazingly! It pick ups LTE+ on the Rogers network and is super fast for both apps performance and internet. Loving the lack of lag!  The screen resolution is obviously amazing and responds very well to touch as compared to some of the older models.
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone the day it was released i preordered it and i have never been so happy with a phone in my life there is nothing i would change about this phone if your looking for a good phone that will not die to fast this is the phone to get it charges from 20% to full in less then 90 mins its...
yes,yes,yes,"this phone is awesome, there are no better phone in the market. totally crashed the IPhone.."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome! Great camera, screen, speed. The colours are so vibrant. I couldn't be happier with my purchase."

yes,no,yes,"Charging pad is the best,,easy to charge quickly"
yes,yes,yes,Its the best phone to have ever with charging pad its quick to charge
yes,yes,yes,"Just picked up this beast this morning and i must say, it is one of the fastest devices i have ever owned"
yes,yes,yes,"If you don'tindustry having to keep your cell constantly charged, then this is the phone for you! Other than the camera could be better, and theres way too much bloatware apps that suck up the battery, it's a great cell."
yes,yes,yes,Its great keep up the good work
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone, battery does not last worth beans. Needs more powerful battery."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome product and lots of features.
yes,no,yes,I would consider myself a moderate user and I can watch the battery life drop as soon as I unplug it. The phone itself is pretty and works very well with all of my apps and games. But the battery life is SO bad that it brings the whole experience down.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung galaxy s6 is a combination of easy to use and everything you could ever want outo of a phone.
yes,yes,yes,I have had this phone for only 2 years and it still works perfectly fine and it only has 1 little scratch... recommend buy

no,no,no,I am on my second replacement. Phone gets extremely hot to the touch. My screen has gone out twice.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone but don't like the built-in battery. Lately I've been having an issue with the battery keeping charge. But overall, a great phone. Just wish I could easily swap the old battery for a new one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
no,no,no,"though it started well, I've had it for two years and now things are going very wrong. when I try to type the keyboardent disappears. and now it's starting to not open."
no,yes,yes,"This Cell phone is okay. However, it need some work on the camera."
yes,yes,yes,"The best phone i've had so far. Lightweight, easy to hold in hand. The phone seems to be water resistant and can charge wireless. Pictures and video are vibrant and good quality. This phone can take some abuse without a case, but dont over estimate it's durrability all phones should be placed in a..."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. Thank you at&t
yes,no,yes,"This phone has saved my life. I was bought this phone a year ago because I knew I'd be living in a another country without a computer, so I intended to have it has my primary method of communication with home and people I met there."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is excellent and good
yes,yes,yes,This Android does everything I need
yes,yes,yes,I am in love with Samsung Galaxy and falling in love with my S6.
no,yes,yes,"Bought this S6 online for store pick-up to replace a dying S3 mini. Thought it might be too big at first, but this size turns out to be ""just right"" after getting used to it. Holds the charge very well, and gets recharged quickly."
yes,yes,yes,"Ordered the product. So happy about it. A great decision. Even with my learning curve, it was a great device."
yes,no,yes,So far it seems to work well but the battery life sux
no,yes,yes,Warranty replacement after warranty replacement. All with very poor battery life. Features and operating system are nice but the Samsung S6 is not a good phone. Have to restart it at least twice a day. I'm on the 24 month NEXT plan and it won't make it 18 months.
yes,yes,yes,I bought this replacement phone for the Galaxy S6 that went through the washing machine
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung Galaxy S6 Active except for the fact that you can't expand memory and storage with an external sd card.
no,no,no,The default SMS app is horrible. Auto delete old messages only deletes incoming messages. After a while starts going very slow and forces you delete a whole thread to get performance back. I love samsung but absolutely hate the default SMS app.
yes,yes,yes,"This is a powerful device with a sturdy body. I like to keep active and take my phone everywhere and it's stood up to the environment well. And the battery life is fantastic, well over a day. Only complaint has been a flaky microphone the last few months, but I'm pretty sure that's a software issue."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is really great! I would recommend to all my friends and family!
yes,yes,yes,"The screen is large, as I need it to be with my aging eyes. The display is crisp. The plug for the earphones is on the bottom, which is better than the top socket on my old Galaxy 4. Camera is definitely improved and I like the visual voicemail option on the phone. So far, so good."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone. It works good and is a beautifully designed phone.
yes,yes,yes,This is my second Samsung phone I have recommended it to friends.
no,no,no,For the second time my screen has broken on my S6 active. I dropped it off of my desk onto my floor. I am not buying another active.
yes,yes,yes,Bought it two weeks ago. Love it. Would recommend it .
yes,yes,yes,Bought this phone of month ago great phone I love it
yes,yes,yes,Everything is great besides memory!! Expandable memory is a must for music lovers!!!!!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,Only had it a week but seems to be the bet phone I have ever had. At times when I watch a video or heavily multitasking it gets a little warm. All in all though it is a great device I would recommend it to others.
yes,yes,yes,This is my second galaxy S6. I like the size and the ease of using it... Love it!
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about the phone except the screen scratched very easily within first few days. I have two friends whose screens have scratched immediately.
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung Galaxy 6. It is like an extension of me, if I do not have it I do not have my schedule, my invoices, my email, my social media, my navigation, or inability to reach out to the world. This phone is reliable, does not break easily, has minimal to no issues and is an overall wonderful phone."
yes,yes,yes,PHone is great but why does it have to be so hard to get my old phone photos transferred?!!!!!! Every time me and my wife lose photos. does evewryone have to be or know IT expert!!!
yes,yes,yes,My husband loves it! Thank you AT&T! We are very happy with our both galaxy s6
yes,yes,yes,I have has this phone for 3 weeks now and it is one of the best phones I have ever had.. Super great!
yes,yes,yes,I bought the phone about a week and so far I am loving it.
yes,yes,yes,I really like all the features of this phone. Only complaint is with the options in the photo gallery. Had more options with my Galaxy S5 sport.
yes,yes,yes,Its a very nice piece of intelligent phone. The screen has excellent resolution and is very bright. The downside is that some times the touch screen does respond as fast as I wanted to. The way the phone process the information also is a little slow some times too.
yes,yes,yes,Great products and services. I am a highly satisfied customer.
yes,yes,yes,The S6 is a step backwards from the much superior S5. The S6's few advantages over the S5 is the slightly faster processor speed and better battery life. Otherwise get a good used S5 or just go for the S7.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone to replace an s4 that I had for 3 years. So glad I took the leap and upgraded! Love the extra memory . Hands down, galaxy are the best phones I have ever owned!"
yes,yes,yes,Replaced my Galaxy 3 with this phone. Very pleased.
yes,yes,yes,I bought it because my wife has one and she is very impress about it. Am also impress about it too
yes,yes,yes,Nice to work with. Slick design and lso the batteries last longer!
yes,yes,no,I wish I could have just stayed with my s5..much easier to use and more durable. I had it for 2 yrs with no problems but it just stopped one day. Instead of paying the insurance deductible I just upgraded. Disappointed!! Too much like the iPhone and I DO NOT like the IPhone at all...
yes,yes,yes,"The phone has very nice features, but don't stray far from plug. My wife has to tell people to call my S6 active because hers is nearly dead 90 % of the time. It's a shame that they didn't add battery life to a more expensive phone."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is a very well designed phone. Overall it has a sleek design and great processor.
yes,yes,yes,It's a good phone but I wish I'd have waited two more months for the 7 !! Hate that it doesn't have a msd slot for expandable memory and it's not water resistant!!
no,yes,yes,"I got the phone, off the bat it had indictable hardware problems"
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first smart phone. I was told to get an I phone as they're suppose to be easier to use. I disagree, my phone is easy to use & figure out. The screen size is great & the price was resonable."
yes,yes,yes,I couldn't have made a better decision by upgrading to the galaxy s
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with my phone. It has exceeded my expectations.
yes,no,yes,I had the note 4 was haveing trouble so I got the galaxy s6. It's faster than the note 4. But it doesn't have a removable battery.the battery is large but doesn't stay charged all day like the note 4.
yes,yes,yes,Amazing how fast you are playing games on it to be a great day.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! Recommend Samsung s6 for a durable phone
yes,yes,yes,Love it. Great phone. Highly recommend it. Charges very well. Great battery.
yes,yes,yes,Great camera and easy to operate luv the large screen.
yes,yes,yes,I had a lot of phones but the Samsung Galaxy S6 is the best I have ever purchase.
yes,yes,yes,The overall Quality of this Phone is up to the standing of Samsung. I am a Samsung product admirer . Another one for the record. the applications for this device are unlimited and I feel that samsung is going to come back with something even more amazing with the next model... Can't wait.
no,yes,yes,Had to replace a lost or stolen Galaxy S5. Forced to get the S6. Hate the OS.
no,yes,yes,But Cant Remove The Battery and dont have an sd card and that takes all choices away. I think that is really dumb.
yes,yes,yes,The AT&T associate Bernard Clark was outstanding in his services 2 me. Plus I like the phone and features.
yes,yes,yes,Switched from a S4 to a S6 and I really like the S6 so much better. The battery charges faster and last longer since I can chose between Power Saving mode and Super Power Saving mode. The camera is so much better and some other smaller features are much better.

yes,yes,yes,Best darn phone I EVER had and still have to this day! I'm a cell tower technician and this is the ONLY phone that I was able to take on the tower considering all the elements I've been through! The #1 phone in my book for guys that do construction!

yes,yes,yes,I'm not pleased with this device. I prefer iPhone.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has been a blessing! It is such an upgrade from my old S3.
yes,yes,yes,I have only had this product for one day. I wish it had better grip. I feel like I am going to drop the device because it keeps slipping out of my hands. It needs a case with better grip. Overall so far it is a great easy to use product.
yes,no,yes,"I liked my s5 but the speaker went out, however my new s6 is the same size as my s5 a little bit more features. What I don't like about the s6 is it is very slippery you will need a cover for it,it doesn't not have a grip back like the s5. You will drop it for sure very slick."
no,no,no,"I've had quite a journey with smartphones, from them suddenly not turning on after turning off by itself while charging it overnight and getting a free replacement, to dropping them in the toilet and eventually having it restored, and to having them die and then losing it in public."
yes,yes,yes,"Like the phone. Reasonable price. Had 2 HTC phones, but always preferred Samsung. Got HTC because Samsung battery charging port broke."
no,yes,yes,I have not had any problems with this phone. I would buy another samsung product
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung galaxy S6 active is a great phone. It's sturdy and does not break easily. It has an extra button that you can set and it makes getting to apps faster. You can also change the theme of the phone if you get bored of the one you have.
no,yes,no,Slow and not like my other gslaxy 6. Apps disapper for no reason. I will open my phone and my phone or my message apps are gone. I have to go looking. Last night i lost my time and weather app. Not too happy
no,yes,no,"Was real close to buying a Motorola phone as a basic text, call, email device. Had the opportunity to pick up this phone and figured why not. I don't use the phone to its fullest potential but look forward to making it work harder."
no,yes,no,"From the jump this phone has been a menace to my daily life. The only good thing about this phone is that I can check my email, take somewhat good pictures, and play games. This phone overheat, it shuts off by itself, sometimes it doesn't even let me answer phone, when I turn the screen on to open..."
no,no,no,The service in very poor quality very unsatisfied the quality is not fast very slow
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone but unfortunately I always have to have a charger with me. Before I got the S6, I had a S4 mini, and all my friends jave iphones. Compared to apple customers I am not as satisfied because the battery life really is problem."
yes,no,yes,Battery dies fast. But features are cool and creative.
yes,yes,yes,"We haven't had the phone a year yet and the battery life jumps. We can be at 5%, plug it in and it jumps to 30%, unplug it and it falls to 3%. We will never own a Samsung again. Can't wait until we can get a new phone on this plan. Going back to Apple!"
no,yes,yes,I was texting and had my Active 6 in my hands on a marble table. The phone fell out of my hands face down and the screen broke. I know others with similar stories about the Active 6.

yes,yes,yes,This phone is the best one I have ever had. The camera takes pictures that rival some actual cameras I have owned. The 4k video recording was a treat. The beautiful LED display makes watching videos and playing games great.  The only drawback is the battery life.
yes,yes,yes,I am very happy with the phone. its arrived one day late but I am happy with it. its take very nice pictures. battery life is a issue.
yes,yes,yes,"Some of the stuff on this phone is new and I would recommend buying a user manua if you are not a ""Techi"". I particularly like the fingerprint function and the fact that I can see the screen much better in broad daylight."

yes,yes,yes,Very good product and a good price. Allowing for the 'sent from my galaxy S6' in Polish no problems whatsoever.

yes,yes,yes,"Display is gorgeous with insane 577 PPI. Camera has to be the BEST! Battery is avg, got a free wireless charger, but I don't find it very useful. This is the closest Samsung has ever come to iPhone! I was confused a bit between iPhone and S6, but trust me now, you can't go wrong with either!"
no,yes,no,"I bought this phone with the hope tat Samsung has evolved but it is very disappointing to see tat inspire of spending lot of money on S6 its utter waste battry sucks. I would rather suggest you to buy HTC , Sony or any other Chinese Brand ."
yes,yes,yes,"By the time you read all 35 review below, the price of the phone will be down by 5k, that's Samsung does always, better to invest on an iPhone , you will never regret your decision."

yes,yes,yes,Amazing Smart Phone Mind Blowing Of course Samsung's Best Phone....
yes,yes,yes,Service is best but product is not
yes,yes,yes,samsung galaxy s6 is a nice choice who love android smartphone but i will say that its not the best phone around here if you are a gaming fan then go for iphones and if you are a os customising fan go for an android with atleast snapdragon 800 above at this price main factor s6 is not very durable...
yes,yes,yes,One of the most responsive and intuitive phones I have used till date. The Mali-T760MP8 GPU does an exceptional job at that. Pros: 1) The metallic body is a class above and along with the Corning Gorilla glass. Nothing beats it.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is absolutely a beast... reviewing this after one week of usage. . No lags even while using heavy games like asphalt.Camera is brilliant and the best display for any smartphone. . Only cons is battery is average but not bad.
yes,yes,no,another overpriced phone from samsung !!! better go for iphone 6 !!
yes,yes,yes,"Even though I love & live Samsung, here are some of my major disappointments with the new Samsung Galaxy S6 / S6 Edge. 1. NO MHL 3 to HDMI support. 2. NO USB 3 / 3.1 & USB type C. 3. NO user replaceable Battery. 4. NO Micro SD card slot. 5. NO IP67 Dustproof or waterproof. 6."

yes,yes,yes,best phone from samsung after a long time i think its best galaxy phone since S2 with its preminum design with best camera in a smartphone with useful software features instead of gimmky ones as in earlier galaxy phones better than HTC one M9 because of camera best screen on any smartphone right now...
yes,yes,yes,"The phone, it's design n user interface are all the best Samsung has done yet. Camera, both front and back are fast n impressive. Design is very sturdy but the back glass makes phone slippery. The only disadvantage is the battery which hardly lasts for a day with moderate usage."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung is always create new phone In this phone Samsung galaxy s6 is best phone available on the market S6 Design Like A iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus Aluminium Body look like a iPhone Brilliant HD Display 16 MP Primary Camera With Optical Image Stabilization ,Auto Focus , LED Flash And 5 MP Front..."
yes,yes,yes,"DESIGN AND DISPLAY: A beautiful and bold design by SAMSUNG, It’s only once you pick it up that you grasp its significance – the reality that this is like no Samsung that’s come before. It is slim sandwich of glass and aluminum, 6.8mm thick and very lightweight at 138g."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy S6 the most anticipated smartphone is here. its the fastest smartphone on earth.. nah! its the fastest on the Whole GALAXY.so here are my first impressions on this phone when laid hands on it.
yes,yes,yes,Its real shame to copying iPhone 6 design (including bendgate controversy for publicity). before you make decision of considering this phone check review only purchased buyer not paid reviews. Take that already price down 7k in 2 weeks.
yes,no,yes,The great people who are saying that this is a copy of iphone cannot see that 1. This is made of glass rather than aluminium in iphone. 2. Software is totally different than ios on iphone 3. Iphone doesnt have an ir blaster on the top 4.

no,no,no,"Irrespective of all the beauty and beast attributes that might exist in a phone, the basic thing that it should have is uninterrupted calling capability. This phone has terrible network connectivity. Same sim, same area, my S3 & S4 work flawless whereas on S6, the voice always breaks. Disappointed"
yes,yes,yes,The phone gives multiple capabilities whether you use for business or gaming. The performance is extremely good. The display and the design are jaw dropping

yes,yes,yes,This is the best smartphone currently. It has the best build quality and the best camera. I am not sure why many are hesitant to buy it. If you want the best camera phone then definitely go for it and you want regret it. I bought this phone after a lots of research among other phones.
no,yes,yes,"S6 is a great phone. A bit expensive though. Using it for almost 2 months now, did not hang even once. Gets a little hot from back after playing game or long usage. I think the screen brightness causes it to heat more than normal.I keep it on auto mode."
yes,yes,yes,"Galaxy S6 from popular brand Samsung with its brand value is elegant and sleek with stunning display with vivid colors ,perfect voice quality and great camera that takes crisp pictures even in low light conditions. This is one of the best Android iPhones in the market at this price range"

yes,yes,yes,This phone works as beautifully as it looks ... it is the best phone and can beat the iPhone 6 and 6 s. .. proud to be an s6 user
no,yes,yes,This is S6 phone NOT S6 EDGE. Don't be fooled with description

yes,yes,yes,This phone is a great looker especially in blue topaz. now i am someone who hates touchwiz of samsung more than anything and prefers stock android.Not surprisingly this phone too failed to change my perception towards touchwiz. The software eats up close to 2.2 GB of RAM at anytime.
yes,yes,yes,Nice looking phone with great features and apps.
yes,yes,yes,"Premium Smart phone with tough build quality and loaded with host of high end features. It's single sim with 4g support. Powerful performence, excellent camera, unique features and decent battery backup."
yes,yes,yes,vikayacha ahe pramod jadha

yes,yes,yes,"Great Camera. Great Performance. Battery backup is slightly disappointing. On average use, it seems to last a full day. Gets overheated sometimes."
no,no,no,Phone has stopped working. Hanged. Within 5 days of use.
no,no,no,This is a poor quality item
yes,yes,yes,I waited for this phone for such a long time as I only wanted in emerald green. When the parcel arrived and I opened it and wow. I cannot express fully when I held it in my hands. Slightly more complicated than my old mobile but it will be a joy to learn all the tricks.
yes,yes,yes,"very good trade, very good sler, very good product , i am fine with this"
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 edge is out of this world. With a slim metal and glass design, incredible screen and fantastic speed, this for me is the best Galaxys yet. Metal and glass give the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge a look and feel of supreme quality that'll make it stand out wherever you take it."
yes,yes,yes,Fine as expected goes well does what the box says give them a try
yes,yes,yes,Simply fantastic phone...
no,yes,yes,The item arrived and immediately revealed a number of irritating faults: 1. Constantly making a beeping sound which seemed to indicate it was attempting to do something but failing repeatedly. Only way to stop it was to mute the phone which is not ideal. 2.
yes,yes,yes,"Without doubt the best phone on the market. Beats the Apple i phone hands down. Would seriously recommend this phone to anyone. Simple , easy to use & set up in minutes pending on service provider. Absolutely thrilled with it, as i have been with Samsung products for a number of years."
no,no,no,"SmartBuyDirect2015 are awful! Ordered s6 edge and they cancelled my order without notification, very disappointed. To make matters worse they then relisted the phone at a higher price! False advertising and a massive time waste!"
yes,yes,yes,Order the samsung s6 edge. Got an email the next day saying it had been cancelled with no explanation and a link so order again at a much higher price. False advertisement at its best.
no,no,no,Absolutely rubbish and way overpriced for what it is.
no,yes,yes,The phone I recieved was sourced in France and sent to the UK. The phone was sent to me from the UK. It comes with a UK travel adaptor so you can use the European one in the box. The quick start instructions were also in French.
yes,yes,yes,"The device itself is fine, although buyer beware - if you are purchasing a samsung for changable batteries (like I was) they have removed this function on the s6. It's just like an iphone now with a permanent battery and one that doesn't last very long."
yes,yes,yes,"Great price for the device, I like the color (blue topaz, but it's more a blue sky color)."
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely mint condition! The phone is mad and beats iPhones by far.
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone, one of the best Samsung designs out."
yes,yes,yes,"I like the phone, it is great and has a great screen, but sorely disappointed in the fact that I can't remove the battery to replace it later and there is no SD card slot. I don't like the iPhone-esk way of putting the SIM in."
yes,yes,yes,The phone works well and I have had a good experience with this purchase.
yes,yes,yes,"Good service, no issues. As described and such a reasonable price."
yes,yes,yes,Exploring it and works fine so far.
yes,yes,yes,Not much to say.. it's just great!
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and even greater price!

yes,yes,yes,"Had the Samsung s3 brilliant phone,now have the Samsung Galaxy s6 exceptional a cut above the rest"
yes,yes,yes,Works great on StraightTalk. Had no issues. Just put in the sim card and it worked great!
yes,no,yes,I love how it's already unlocked so I can use it on almost every carrier around the globe! + it works on Verizon as well.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone but the battery life sucks, but I was warned. Only redemption is the super (I mean ripping fast) fast charger. But as much as I love the speed and feel quality of this phone I miss the micro HDMI port out I had on my dinosaur Motorola RAZr Maxx."
yes,no,no,The hands-free feature doesn't work.
yes,yes,yes,It's awesome and my husband loves it
yes,yes,yes,Exactly what I needed
no,no,yes,I had bought a phone few days back. It was giving intermittent network loss from beginning. After couple of days signal used to disappear and reappear. Now it is totally gone. I changed to a new sim in between but that also has not helped.
yes,no,yes,"Exquisitely Crafted, Captivatingly Brilliant Inspired by the works of glass blowers and artisan metal-smiths, the Samsung Galaxy S6 represents a unique fusion of glass moulding and metal sculpturing techniques."
no,no,no,Display and overall experience is fine but heating problem is there..and due to metal body..heating rises very rapidly
yes,yes,yes,This is a really great phone. Right now can be called the best android smartphone. Got mine yesterday. Go for it!
yes,yes,yes,Awesome mobile... what a quick response.. best mobile for 2015
no,yes,no,"There's a 1-star review here that says it's imported and no warranty. Not for me. Mine is definitely Indian with MRP sticker and even a warning that an Indian SIM card should be inserted before some other countries', or else the system will lock you out. What else can I say about this phone?"
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S6 leaves much of its Galaxy S5 DNA behind. Perhaps even more shocking than this materials about-face are the decisions to seal in the battery and leave out a microSD card slot, both choices made in service to staying slim."
yes,yes,yes,"Advantages -5.1"" Quad HD Super AMOLED Display With 576 pixel density(576 ppi?Isn't that the best in class?) -16 MP rear camera and 5 MP front camera (The camera isn't the best in class but the features are amazing) -Quick launch feature (Open Camera in 0.7 seconds) -Tracking auto focus(It is a must..."
no,yes,yes,"Don't get fooled guys, it's imported, no warranty, you will be cheated"
yes,yes,yes,"I Got A Gold Platinum S6 64GB, Best Android Smartphone till Date. Well Secured Now, Superb Camera, Amazing Display, Latest Os 5.0.2 [LOLLIPOP], Well Built All Over with Gorilla Glass 4 again A Latest and Alloy Metal very Classy. At this Price A must Buy Compared to iPhone6 or iPhone6 plus."
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic cam , TW sucks , awesome build and looks"

no,no,yes,Overheating while on charging .
no,yes,yes,Great camera but worst Battery Only below 3 hours onscreen time in powersaving mode.
yes,yes,yes,"Pros-Amazing display,mind blowing camera,beast in performance,stellar looks,smoothest smartphone experience ever(better than IPHONE 6),fast charging. Cons-Very delicate(apply a case as soon as you buy this),no sd card support(not really a big deal for me),Battery life is just above average(3.5 hours..."
no,yes,no,This phone sucks. Completely dis satisfied after using s4 and S5. God knows how can Samsung make such a bad device. . Waste of money. No need to buy this device if you have a S4 or S5. To me S4 is the best device they have developed apart from it's hanging issues.
yes,no,yes,Awesome phone with average battery life
no,no,yes,"I love this even more than I did the S3 I had before it. However, after 6 months use, the battery now gets discharged very quickly, hence only 4 stars"
no,yes,yes,Rubbish battery life.
yes,yes,yes,"The S6 is a beautiful product. The camera and screen are amazing. It produces gorgeous and accurate photos. Multi tasking works well, but I'd recommend installing a separate launcher over the top of TouchWiz. The battery is its hugest downfall, draining exceptionally quickly."
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic phone, gold looks great in it as well, probably the best phone I've ever had, I'll add more memory to it through a sd card then I'm away! Check the specs if you need to know more. [...]"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is excellent no any problems work properly.
yes,yes,yes,"Really nice, I love it. Everything goes well..."
yes,yes,yes,My daughter loves it as a replacement for a MotoG second gen. Fast with plenty of memory.
yes,no,yes,"I'm a long term Samsung fan and love my tech. This phone has been absolutely great for me. although the battery life is not as good as I would like a year in, it's still lasting me a day unless I play Clash of Clans too much."
yes,yes,yes,"While everything is mostly fine, the rear camera has smashed twice. Because it isn't flush to the back case, it seems, it's more likely to break, even if you're careful with it. Far better to buy a phone that doesn't have this design flaw."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent...genuine sealed UK S6...no problems and a great phone.
no,no,yes,"Just one year after purchase, neither I dropped it nor exposed to water but the screen turned purple n blue first and turned completely black now. Not usable anymore."
yes,yes,yes,Still the best Smart phone that Samsung produce.
yes,yes,yes,Great price my son want one for Xmas and took it out of box to update and get a SIM in it he loves it to bits - love the fast charge option although I did get a trickle pad charger as well. Good product only con so far is no SD card slot but knew that - which is why I have the S7 Edge.
yes,yes,yes,Wife loves her new galaxy..
yes,yes,yes,Would have helped to have a better instruction manual on how to use and operate the various applications.
yes,yes,yes,"Bought this phone in Oct 2015, still going great. Battery once charged can last two days if used moderately. No issues at all and the picture quality is amazing. I am loving this phone, it was my upgrade from Galaxy 3 and I am very happy to buy this."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. The slight crack in the screen is barely noticeable, and therefore worth the discounted price I paid. Phone is fast, sleek, and feels good in the hand. Only issue is that the battery life is not great, unlikely to last a full day even with fairly limited usage."
yes,yes,yes,"Nope the above goes to the Galaxy S6 Edge. I have had one, I paid £800 for it and if design matters to you or you have millions of friends and love to show off then thats the one you should buy, just do it, this review raves about the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the edge is better, just over priced for..."
yes,yes,yes,"Has a lot of nice features. And 128GB is a lot of space. The battery sucks though, and the camera could be a bit better. But overall I like it a lot."
yes,yes,yes,"Great camera as with all samsung phones. Love the huge storage option on this model. Screen is stunning, samsung pay option is an awesome feature. Best way to get rid of all the plastic from the wallet.Big drawbacks for the value side: No sd card and battery replacement capability."
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy S6 has met and exceeded my expectations and more. I purchased this phone as an upgrade to my dying S5 Active. It has a wonderful screen with a high pixel density so the screen is sharp and colorful. The biggest selling point was the VR capabilities for me.
no,no,no,Finger print pick up is a little week. Many times it will not work and I have to use the backup number.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone has plenty of memory really fast processor and just all around everything you could ask for. The only issue i have is battery life goes quick on or off, but i will deal with it because it is an amazing phone."
yes,yes,yes,Great overall device.Would like better battery life and micro sd
yes,yes,yes,"Lover everything about it! Takes great pictures, easy to use. Has all the apps I had on my Iphone. But the picture quality is so much better. I love it"
yes,yes,yes,I love love love my phone.... I use my phone for everything. I can print from my phone. My phone blocks phone numbers & let's me know if they r harassment issues or sales/ads & says how many ppl have reported them. My phone us fantastic plus the 128 gb feature.
yes,yes,yes,The best phone I havever ever owned. Has an awesome screen
yes,yes,yes,I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN A SAMSUNG FAN THERE PRODUCTS KEEP IMPROVING MORE THAN ANY OTHER SIMPLE TO USE QUICK TO LEARN WITH NO PROBLEMS WITH OVERVIEW I GIVE IT A THUMBS UP
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded after 4 years from my galaxy III and only because I cracked my screen. Boy am I glad this happened! ! I'm in love with the 6. Everything from the camera to the screen resolution.
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone and I have had several of the more recent models of Samsung's phones and tablets. This phone is great. It offers a ton of internal memory, a fantastic design, and many updated features that seemingly have had their usefulness and design meet expectations like never before."
yes,yes,yes,"I really like the galaxy s6. I got the gold colored one at at&t. The cameras are amazing, the photographs look professional. My wife even admitted that my camera is better.I enjoy a lot of the pre-installed apps like peel smart remote and s health. Everything runs like it should. Seemless."
yes,yes,yes,So far I really like this phone. I'm still learning more about it. I wish there were more space on the main screen for the important items to me. Other than that I'm quite satisfied.
yes,yes,yes,"When the tablet idea started, I thought it could become more than a practical joke only if the size was reduced to fit into a shirt pocket. That never happened, and smartphones were always too small and/or too slow and/or lacking function. The Galaxy S6 is now a smartphone I finally use as a tablet."
yes,yes,yes,Hands down it's the best Galaxy yet! The S6 has so many features and smokes any Apple product on the market now and in the future. The Samsung product line is much more user friendly and there is so much more you can do with the Galaxy that you just can't name them all.
yes,yes,yes,"I honestly like this phone. It has the perfect amount of storage for me. I liked it so much that I purchased one for my husband. Oh and it is durable, I am constantly dropping my phone (you could say I have buttered fingers)."
no,yes,no,Phone has been acting up since I got it. It is barely 6 months old and constantly goes into split screen un-commanded. Now I can't even open an app without it cycling through several apps. It detects your finger movement and hides commands as you attempt to select an option.
yes,yes,no,"I like the builded in battery and with 128gb storage, it's make the phone goes smoother and no lag. I had the 16gb note 2 and note edge before that, and they froze all the times, especially when I uploading lots of pictures or video in facebook, they will froze and restart themselves."
yes,yes,yes,"Just recently I went on a 7 day Civil Rights Tour of the South...it goes without saying that I was taking a multitude of pictures to capture this AWESOME experience. Whereas I had hesitated buying the phone mainly because of the initial cost of it, I am thankful for every dollar spent!!!"
no,yes,no,"Quality wise it's ok, but i already had issues with two brand new phones. The battery life on this phone is the worst. Night time pictures are awful. In conclusion I'm waiting for the right time to buy a phone with the previous brand I had."
yes,yes,yes,I was a bit worried about battery life being you can't change battery but it is great and the speed of the phone is great ! The pictures are beautiful I am glad I got this phone no regrets !
yes,yes,yes,"Galaxy s6 is the best phone I've ever used. Sharp camera, super fast performance. Also battery life is longer than I expected."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone..... It's Sleak, Sexy & Fast. ..."
yes,yes,yes,I have been using this phone for about a month. I am happy with it. There are Apps that came with the phone that I do want or use.
yes,yes,yes,I am absolutely in love with my Samsung Galaxy S6!
yes,yes,yes,"I studied & looked over several different options for a new phone over several months. The Galaxy S6 is simply the best phone I've ever held in my hands. It's exceded , by far, any expectations I had for it, & I'm so glad this is the phone I settled on."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is very easy to use and the clarity of the pictures is excellent. I would highly recommend this phone to friends.
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone. Always had an android, but I'm a little upset now after updating to 5.1.1 my phone is lagging like an iphone when I'm sending messages. I've cleared the cache and memory ram, deleted messages and reset my keyboard settinng and still hasnt fix the issue, getting pretty anoyed now."
yes,yes,yes,"I had my Galaxy S3 for years and now I have a S6 and I love it. This phone is fast, dependable and the display is gorgeous."
yes,yes,yes,I have the Samsung Galaxy S6 for like 1 month. I am loving it. So far I love almost everything about it. I only don't like how it doesn't come with a detail manual on what the device can do and what/how to use all the different programs/apps loaded.
yes,yes,yes,"The review title doesn't sound like a glowing review, but it actually is high praise. We expect so much from our electronics these days (or at least I do), that to say a device meets those expectations is saying a great deal."
yes,yes,yes,"I was able to adapt to the lack of additional memory capabilities, but the battery life was a tough pill to deal with,"
yes,no,yes,Just got a replacement S6 factory warranty phone because my microphone quit working on my original device. The replacement arrived next morn and reinstalled and duplicated the original completely automated. The best restore EVER! Thanx SamSung engineering. Nice work.
yes,yes,yes,"I love Samsung products. I really enjoyed my S4, my boyfriend has the S5 and it is OK. The S6 is good but I'm hoping the S7 will be more like the S4 but better."
yes,yes,yes,"This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. No glitches, very fast, great screen and sturdy housing. I have already talked 2 of my friends into buying themselves a Samsung Galaxy S6. I can't even imagine how the upcoming Galaxy S7 could possibly surpass this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had iPhones for years from the 4 until the 6 and this is a huge change. Really like the platform of the Samsung S6, it's super thin, fast response time and looks completely awesome!"
yes,yes,yes,"The s-5 was a great platform but is out performed by the S-6. Great for business, photography and video are excellent. Capable of multitasking and multi window is awesome. I am pleased with the amount of space on the phone and it is amazingly user froendly"
no,yes,no,The only issue I had is that it stopped recognizing my fingerprint. So I factory reset it
yes,yes,yes,"Changed from an iPhone to Samsung, and while it has been a learning curve, I'm very happy with my decision. Plus all the associate sites we're very helpful in making the switch and keeping all my pictures, music, and contacts."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my third Samsung Galaxy phone and have loved every one of them. Any issues I have had were with apps that were poorly written, not the device itself. The camera is amazing, speech to text is pretty accurate. I love the Android platform and pure support for all of the Google apps."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone over my Galaxy S4. The speed is right up there with my Galaxy Tab S so they compliment each other. Many people say they don't like it because no removable battery and no SD Card.
yes,yes,yes,i love this phone and everything about it woud definitely reccomend to a friend
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, I went from a HTC to Samsung and the differance is amazing. Just love my new Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. not really sure on somethings yet, such as voicemail."
no,no,yes,cant delete but 1 email at a time very much a pain to do
yes,yes,yes,"I waited forever to get a new phone after having my S3 for what seemed forever. I'm glad I waited. I love this phone. It is fast, slim, light weight, and has a great camera. I just had a baby and both cameras take fantastic pictures. I love all the editing I can do as well. It's fantastic!"
yes,yes,yes,"Coming from a razr Maxx, I'm thrilled with my S6!! It's fast, the display is absolutely beautiful and the battery life is really good...UNLESS you have your location set to ON, then it just zaps your battery life in a matter of a few hours without even using your phone."
yes,yes,yes,"So far, I am loving my Galaxy S6! I love how I can customize it with themes and everything."
no,yes,yes,"Less than two weeks old, the phone, in a case, dropped 3 feet to a carpeted floor and the screen shattered. It doesn't matter how cool the phone is if it's that fragile."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, does everything I want. Camera is really good."
yes,yes,yes,just what I expected thanks
yes,yes,yes,"Looked liked new when received, everything working perfectly, fab screen and the best of all it's a great price so fabulous value for the money!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is a fab piece of kit although not top of the line it certainly holds its own up when compared to some of the more recent phones. This was bought as a present for my mother she adores it.
yes,yes,yes,Suits me and I keep finding more applications and features
no,no,no,Awful battery life and worst phone I've ever had the misfortune of buying.
yes,yes,yes,"Love my phone :) Shipped quick, great condition....very happy! Samsung is ALWAYS a win ;)"

yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy S6 meets my requirements it is new and working well

yes,yes,yes,Came as described - good product
yes,yes,yes,every thing on phone works ok looks good
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Great camera. (Front and back) Fast. Excellent screen / picture. Can't fault it!!
no,no,no,"I've had this phone less than 2 months. It's not been dropped or damaged in any way. However, the back key is stuck on and so I now can't use it at all. Apparently it's a hardware fault, and some of them just have it. Annoying and expensive to replace."
yes,yes,yes,Very good product
yes,yes,yes,If you want a quick summary of my review read this bit! I explain in sections below if you need a bit more detail The S6 is leaps and bounds ahead of the S5 and stands out as the best android flagship at this time.

yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy s6 was the best 2015 smartphone for me. Six generations after the roll out of the first Galaxy in 2010 Samsung giving us the most beautiful Galaxy in 2015 : The Galaxy s6.
yes,yes,yes,"I got this phone as an upgrade to my Samsung s4. It is a lot sleeker and the design is good. The camera on the phone is excellent, it rivals my digital SLR for quality of pictures. I love the beauty mode when taking a selfie! It makes you look years younger!"
yes,yes,yes,"The situation with me, is that I have been looking for the perfect smartphone for over 2 months now. I have honestly spent minimum 3 hours almost everyday looking through countless 10-20 minute Youtube videos, as well as expert review websites, and the annoying thing is nobody really seems to cover..."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought my phone the end of Nov and really, really like it. Had the old Samsung and wasn't happy with the battery life (granted, the phone was 3 years old) but this new S^ I would recommend - love it!"
yes,yes,yes,"Today I am going to review the Samsung Galaxy S6 – 32GB Who Makes It? The company that makes this phone is Samsung. It is a South Korean company that was founded in 1938. Today they are best known for things like televisions, fridges and other large appliances but they are also a big name in the..."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent Phone, it's sleeker, more efficient with better quality sound, pictures and overall performance. Would recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a new phone, however the battery is a bit poor if you're on it constantly, the gigabite within the phone has come to the point where the..."
yes,no,yes,"I really do think that the Samsung galaxy s6 is a step into the future.. it's new dual band processor marks the start of a faster generation, where together everybody can stay connected."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S6 on its release day. Since then I'm very satisfied with the device. The look and feel of the phone is in my opinion great, the battery life when yo use all it's powers is around a full day but it has a power saving mode that boosts the life of the battery to 3--4 days."
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with it!
yes,yes,yes,"Taking time getting used to android after iOS for years but getting there. Spent a while comparing different specs for android phones and landed on this or the edge as the best options with the only real difference between the two being pretty sides, if you're looking to switch would suggest you..."

yes,yes,yes,I really like all the features of this phone. Only complaint is with the options in the photo gallery. Had more options with my Galaxy S5 sport.
yes,yes,yes,Its a very nice piece of intelligent phone. The screen has excellent resolution and is very bright. The downside is that some times the touch screen does respond as fast as I wanted to. The way the phone process the information also is a little slow some times too.
yes,yes,yes,Great products and services. I am a highly satisfied customer.
yes,yes,yes,The S6 is a step backwards from the much superior S5. The S6's few advantages over the S5 is the slightly faster processor speed and better battery life. Otherwise get a good used S5 or just go for the S7.
yes,yes,yes,Switched from a S4 to a S6 and I really like the S6 so much better. The battery charges faster and last longer since I can chose between Power Saving mode and Super Power Saving mode. The camera is so much better and some other smaller features are much better.

yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone, significant improvement over my s4!"

yes,yes,yes,"This phone is easier to use than my two previous smart phones , both HTC ONEM8GRY."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is beautiful, and I love the camera. Everything about it is sophisticated in general and the design is magnificent, but the hardware is lacking. My phone crashes unexpectedly all of the time (my apps, usually, which doesn't happen to an old smart phone I have that's a different brand), the..."
yes,yes,yes,"A great phone for a great price. Camera is amazing,"
yes,yes,yes,"great phone with great features. The only con I have so far---I have hade the phone for 4 days and the screen chipped and cracked. I didn't drop it, I think I may have sat it down to hard on my marble top counter, that's the only thing I can think that may have happened."
yes,yes,yes,"I have owned a Samsung III for 6 years now and needed a new phone, so I had no hesitation in choosing the Samsung phone again. I just love the easy use and everything about it. My daughter likes my phone so much, she's actually going to purchase the same one. Thank you"

yes,yes,yes,"I hate this phone! It looks pretty but that's about it. Love that it has a beautiful 2k screen, how ever due to the tiny battery that they put in you want get more then 5 feet from your charger cord if you want to do anything with the phone at all."
yes,yes,yes,phone has been great for the first month
yes,yes,yes,Just now activating it but I'm sure it's going to be much better than my five-year-old Samsung Infuse 97 I had in a very long time and none of the features were even able to be used with it I don't think I hope I'm wrong because I'd like to put a lot of my information from that phone to this new S6

yes,yes,yes,I previously had a Samsung 4 but it unexpectedly stopped charging so I went in to by a new phone and the Samsung 6 was recommended. I wish it was smaller but overall it functions well and the camera feature is very high quality.
yes,yes,yes,I love my galaxy s6 even tho the s7 has already came out but i chose this phone because of the camera quality to record clips to make a comercial. But there is one thing i don't like about it is that it isn't waterproof like the s5. The build is remarkable tho.

yes,no,yes,I love pretty much everything about this phone. I will probably never buy another brand or model again.
yes,yes,yes,"I just love this phone!I had a huge dilemma trying to choose between the S6 and the new S7. After reading a ton of reviews and comparisons, I chose the S6 mostly because of the ""Gorilla Glass"" that covers the S7."
yes,yes,yes,I received this phone to replace my Iphone. I have to say I like the operation of this phone better. But the I liked the the size of my Iphone much better. The Samsung feels a little clumsy in my hand.

no,no,no,Battery life is terrible compared to the s6 active I wish I had never switch.
yes,yes,yes,This product has great camera and other features that continues to amaze millions of customers around the world. It's not only transmit voice signal or capture pictures it help families and businesses connect and share their feelings and conduct business.

no,yes,yes,"Scant AT&T service area are bolster by owner/operator adding and paying monthly HighSpeed Internet cost then buying an AT&T Microcell device. However, this Samsung device WILL NOT OPERATE within this environment! Average 17. percent Drop Call Rate is GOOD?!"

yes,yes,yes,TouchWiz has really come a long way. I have been avoiding Samsung for a while (since Android 4) because of the custom launcher but it is actually now enjoyable to use.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has what I need. Samsung pay works with most machines. Dollar General still needs an upgrade to work. Scrolling and multi aps are another plus. S health is a favorite. The S6 fills my needs and I am learning more everyday of what I can do.
yes,yes,yes,it is a very good phone coming from a ZTE zmax the only down fall is the screen is a little smaller and the galaxy S6 gets a little hot while gaming or constantly playing video very good clear graphics
yes,yes,yes,I have owned the note 5 and the s6 I would have to say that they are both great phones. The only difference between both of the phones would be that you can change the channel on your TV with the s6. #teamgalaxy
yes,yes,yes,"the phone is great with a lot of features,easy to use and to get use to"
yes,yes,yes,"Wasn't thrilled when my old phone died, having to learn a new one, but I really enjoy this phone. I've had little trouble figuring it out. Only real complaint is some of the apps loaded that I can't disable"

yes,yes,yes,"Lost the SD card and MHL (HDMI) function, but otherwise feature packed like Galaxy S line has always been."

no,yes,yes,"...it gets hung up. A LOT! Mostly the keyboard. It just stops working for 20-30 seconds, and when it does start working again, it enters random letters. I thought it may have been the stock keyboard, but it does it with other ones as well. Other than that, it's a great phone."

yes,yes,yes,I have had a Samsung Phone since my father passed away in 2012. He was only 52 years old and I was 23. The phone was a gift to myself in my time of mourning. I know this sounds weird but it is true. I have loved the phone ever since.
yes,yes,yes,"Everything is impressive, camera is amazing and battery lasts long.It is a little bit slippery and easy to drop, so get a cover for it, although it is resilient."
yes,yes,yes,"Product Has single handedly switched me from wanting to use iOs, this light weight phone can completely take you a different place with the new Gear VR , I only wish now the screen was wider and will likely upgrade to an S7 in the near future."
yes,yes,yes,This has been a great phone to upgrade to. My only frustration is the fingerprint reader.. which works most of the time.. but occasionally will not recognize any of my entries.
yes,yes,yes,This is overall a great phone. I love the fingerprint scanner option. Allows me to unlock my phone faster as well as sign into certain personal apps/websites. The s health app feature which can measure your heart rate and oxygen level is something I'd never expected to see in a phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Great features, fast paced, great connection, great quality."
yes,yes,yes,As usual another great product from Samsung. Flawless integration with my other Samsung products
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy 6 is a workhorse, the ability to have all of my work documents, and access to my OneNote notes on the go is a huge plus. The only thing I wish it had was what my Samsung Galaxy S5 and S4 had a SD card slot, being confined to only 32GB is a huge downfall."
yes,yes,yes,Product meets and exceeds all functions and uses for a cell phone. I would recommend this product to my friends and colleagues.
yes,yes,yes,"Even though I haven't had many phones this one is the best so far. It's pretty easy to use, I like how it feels in my hand not too heavy that it's bothersome or too light that if I drop it will break easily. The sound quality is good and so is how everything looks on screen."
no,no,no,I miss my s5 on Sprint. No expandable memory on this phone no drive mode or car mode on this phone and come to find out the 7 has expandable memory and I have to wonder if DriveMode is put back on I am stuck with this phone for 2 years and I am highly disappointed wish I could have my sprint s5 back
yes,yes,yes,Every you could want in a phone it has and more. D
yes,yes,no,"Broke my Samsung 4S, got Samsung 6S, wish I had 4S back. What Samsung calls ""upgrade"" is actually a step down, NOT as much controlled over Alarm, harder to set, not many snooze times. Harder to delete Email weather read or unread, U must do EACH 1, no longer clicking on ""All"" for that day."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new S6! I've owned the S2, 3, 4, 4active, and 5. All have been fantastic and they just keep getting better. I love the wireless charging capabilities, and the faster processor! Overall I'm very pleased with the phone and all my Samsung products!"
no,yes,yes,"This product is okay, its not that great and I expected better. I am used to the S4 features and options so I do not like the S6 that much. 1. For example the alarm cannot be turned off or snooze with voice command and while setting up the alarm I have to press the ""keypad"" icon to change the alarm..."
yes,yes,yes,"Totally awesome features, easy to use,vibrant colors"
yes,yes,yes,"One of the many reasons I left iPhone was because I could not expand my memory or change my batteries.... The phone works like I've come to expect from a galaxy, but the rest is laking. Another reason I'm not liking it is more bloatware."
yes,yes,yes,Its a nice phone..love everything about it. Great product.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone will do just about anything you want I would not use any other product..
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. I have nothing bad to say. I love the easy use of all the apps. And would like to thank Samsung for it.
yes,yes,yes,My only issues with the phone are the lack of access to the battery and the lack of SD card support. Otherwise I love everything else about it.
yes,yes,yes,"Had hard time setting up and activating, Still not able to transfer contacts, Keypad 1/3 the size of my S4 Active, wish I had tried before I had it delivered. As yet, not satisfied."
yes,yes,yes,"Don't get me wrong, the hardware and potential this phone has is phenomenal, but the S6 has fallen short of my expectations when it comes to meeting some requirements or having features I find fundamental to the concept of owning a Smart Phone that is intended to make my day more efficient and..."
yes,yes,yes,A very light portable phone...Great sound quality. great photos...exceptional color....and fast.....worth every penny
yes,yes,yes,"This is the first Samsung Phone I got after a long time of using iPhone, so far I like this phone.. its a learning curve after using iPhone for so long and it was bit confusing at first.. so the verdict is Good Phone and lots of good features at a good price"
no,yes,no,i am completely digusted with this phone. my s4 had better performance than this one. im angry i payed as much as i did and it freezes and locks up all the time. constantly have to restart it 3 times a day. i am sicked i payed so much money for this hunk of junk.and now i am stuck with it
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Sometimes touchscreen sensitivity can be a little off.
yes,yes,yes,This could have been a great phone but I upgraded from a note 4 and this phone has less battery power and is a little buggy at times. It also has no SD storage for extra space.
yes,yes,yes,It's a great phone but I would have loved memory expansion. The power charging is great I can charge my phone right before I go to school and have it at high for the whole day
yes,no,yes,"This is the second Samsung phone that I have had, the design of the S6 is sleek and very stylish, the performance is outstanding, the only thing that I wwould recommend to improve upon the S6 is that a memory card slot would be a benefit, seeing how the S6 is not waterproof."
yes,yes,yes,"I am techno challenged and really like this phone, just wish it were more user friendly for us uninitiated"
no,yes,no,I really like this phone. The only thing I don't like is it doesn't have enough RAM. I have to constantly clean my memory or it doesn't load on wifi and is really slow even though I have taken a lot of the preloaded apps off that the phone company has installed.
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone, not to big but has a very nice diaplay. Plenty of storage, takes very nice pictures."
yes,yes,yes,Phone works like a charm with some of the coolest features I have ever seen on a phone couldn't ask for more
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Intuitive enough for even an old man to use (at least with it's basics).
yes,yes,yes,I love the new bells and whistles compared to the S4.
yes,yes,yes,"I truly enjoy my S6, the newest features make it easy to get to my apps quickly with half the time it took on the S4, the only thing I didn't like in the beginning was that I could not put an SD card in it, but I was told about an app I could use to transfer things from my SD card in my S4 to my S6..."
yes,yes,yes,I have been super happy with my S6 and would recommend it glowingly......
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first android smartphone, I previously had a windows phone. Overall, I like this phone ok although there are a few things that I would like changed. The fingerprint feature doesn't always work."
yes,yes,yes,the camera gives out stunning pictures would recommend to anyone who loves photos
yes,yes,yes,"The wife had the s4 and I had the s5, when the s6 came out and we saw how much better the camera was, better sound quality and runs much faster, so we bought 2 new ones. Three months in we are extremely happy with our choice! !"

yes,yes,yes,I love all features on this S6. Very easy to use.

yes,yes,yes,This has been a great phone for a novice. I was able to learn it's basics quickly and have been learning the most advanced stuff as I go. I would highly recommend any Samsung product. Great quality.
no,no,no,I found that the touchWiz app crashed multiple times. I always saw a popup coming up after I navigate back to home screen from a window.
yes,yes,yes,Just purchased this phone. It is galaxies superior to the S3 which I used for three years.
yes,yes,yes,I don't miss miss the iPhone at all. So happy with my galaxy!!
yes,yes,yes,"Overall excellent device. I say device because the phone component of it in comparison to everything else that it can easily handle almost makes it a micro tablet.Even with near 100 applications installed, the device does not become sluggish. At times it can get rather warm."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, easy to use, lots of features, wireless charging is great."
yes,yes,yes,"I switched from another brand to the Samsung Galaxy, and I'm so glad I did. This phone has some great features and capabilities that have made it more of a joy and less of a hassle to have a mobile phone."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my 4th Samsung Galaxy and the reason I will never own an IPhone. The performance and reliability it stunning. The slick design, the awesome camera, the connectivity, the remarkably clear sound from the bottom speaker the speed on this is amazing and the batter though heavy use is phenomenal."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung has always been a great choice! I love the features on the phone. The fast charging is a great idea. One question: will the newer version of Samsung have the memory card port? I had that option for the S5 but it wasn't added for the S6.
yes,yes,yes,"Switched from IOS and it took me a little while to adjust to the features, but the picture is great, the speed is excellent. I got the GearVR and it is amazing. I would recommend it. It isn't cheap but so far it is worth it."
yes,yes,yes,"I first had the s6 active which had been the wrost Samsung phone I've owned. After owning the s4 active which was great I expect the s6 active to be even better but not the case. So is why I switched to the s6, good phone but would of preferred the active if it wasn't for all the bad features on it"
yes,yes,yes,"After my phone was stolen, they sent me another one and I love it! It has amazing features that will just amaze you!"
yes,yes,yes,This feature has about everything you need on the go.
yes,yes,yes,"This is my second Samsung phone (my previous one was a Note 2). The performance of this phone is excellent, lightweight and has a brilliant display."
yes,yes,yes,Another great product by samsung. Great quality.buy.
yes,yes,yes,"I used to be an iPhone person, and I felt like I was missing out. Until I got this phone, never looking back"
yes,yes,yes,although I like the galaxy S6 it is missing features that I greatly liked in my galaxyS5! S5 had the signature option in messaging which I loved! S6 doesn't. Why take it away?? Using the blue tooth to listen to my muzik the distance is shorter with the S6 than both the S5 and S4!!! why?
yes,yes,yes,I love it it's the best phone ever better than the other phone I love the design I love the camera quality price is good best phone of 2015-2016
yes,yes,yes,"Easy to use, great phone, great sound, one of the best phone I have owned and I"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the fact that I can download my application using wifi, easy to learn, colorful pictures, easy installation of applications. The network is very good compared to other phones, it's just like having a little computer in my hands since it has most of the things I need in a computer."
yes,yes,yes,The phone is amazing! Fast processing and battery life is impressive!
yes,yes,yes,"I love how fast this phone charges. Great size. A little faster than later model. I also really like that the volume buttons are designed a little different, easier to use when in a call. I like where they placed the power button a little lower, now it is not in the way of picking up phone."
yes,yes,yes,Love my Samsung Galaxy S6. I have no problem with any of the features and stay connected while using the phone unlike my previous phone that dropped calls often.
yes,yes,yes,"Overall a smooth running device that multitasking well and performs well. The battery is decent and the design of the device is sleek. A little expensive, but I feel it is worth it since it is the best device on the market."
yes,yes,yes,THE BEST PHONE TO HAVE IN YOUR LIFE..THE FEATURES ARE ABSOLUTELY BEYOND AWESOME AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANY PHONE BE ABLE TO STAND AGAINST OR COMPARE WITH THIS GALAXY..SAMSUNG IS WHERE ITS AT BABY GET YOURSELF A GALAXY S6 OR EVEN BETTER A S6 EDGE PLUS..I PROMISE YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED

yes,yes,yes,"I like this phone a lot. It has great features and does everything well. The only complaint I have is average battery life. It could have been better. I struggle to end the day without a midday recharge. Other than that, I love it."
yes,yes,yes,"I am new to the smartest of the smartphones so I can only review what I am familiar with and so far, I really like this phone. I have a small hand and it is easy to hold and grip. I have an Otter Box case so it is more bulky."
yes,yes,yes,Something that I have to say is it don't go around looking for the things I can't find or ask stupid questions that are not smart. My s6 figured out how to accommodate things my other half is yet to require. It remembers everything I tell it and it's never late.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy S6 is the best in the current market. it has Excellent Design; Awesome Display; Brilliant Camera; Great Battery Life.
yes,yes,yes,Upgraded from S4 to the S6. The S6 has just a slightly larger screen and higher camera specs. Functions just the same with more features. The system runs a whole lot faster. Only thing I don't like about the S6 is there is no micro card slot.
yes,yes,yes,"Coming from a Samsung Galaxy s4, I don't really see that much of a difference in the quality of the phones. The Galaxy s4 I had for about a year, and never had any problems with it where as with the s6 I am three weeks into owning it and not only is the phone malfunctioning but the accessories that..."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung product has good features and offers a lot but there is still room for some added extension of growth. I think they are just doing the minimum but it's time for Samsung to push it self.
yes,yes,yes,I've owned every iPhone model since introduced. When it came time to purchase this phone I decided to try a new route....I went Android. Went with the Galaxy S6 in the black sapphire color. Phone looks and feels great.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, great apps, good overall performance and speed."
yes,yes,yes,"Just want to say I've seen product testing of all types on this device, but I have another to add. I've seen the drop test, water test, boiling water test but by accident I completed a freezer test. I dropped my phone in my chest freezer and couldn't find it for 6 days."
yes,yes,yes,this is an awesome phone I love playing my games the bright display makes it easy to see and searching the internet is easy
yes,yes,yes,"Gets great reception, camera takes great quality pictures, can keep up when you're multitasking, the quick charge is awesome only takes 15 minutes at the most to fugly charge the battery... honestly I can't think of anything negative to say about this product. I love my phone!"
no,yes,no,I see that you cannot open the back of this phone. Why is that?
yes,yes,yes,"The S6 has some good, new features coming from the S4. I love that Samsung keeps the settings and features consistent, so learning about your new Samsung phone is quick and easy."
yes,yes,yes,I have owned many phones and I would have to say that the Galaxy S6 is the best phone out there in the marketplace. I love the ease of use not to mention the fast processor that keeps me moving at my fast pace during my hectic business day.
yes,yes,yes,"They just keep getting better... Sgs6 feels a little delicate with the glass back.. Basically requires a case, great phone. Battery life is big disappointment.. Sgs5 would last all day.. With sgs6 I'm back to trying to save on battery drain just to barely make it thru the day at work..."
no,no,no,I like the integration with google. Too Hard to back up. I did a back up and reset and now my contacts are lost.
yes,yes,yes,Ive owned alot of phones over the years /my last 3 phones though have all been samsung ! Samsung products have never let me down and are very durable /i recently aquired the samsung S6 and love it i cant stop messing with it it has so many features and is unbelievably fast and can handle anything...
yes,yes,yes,"If you like to take lots of pictures. This phone comes with one awesome camera and great editing features. Being able to download files from my emails and editing them, is another great tool this phone provides. The accessibility of it is very user friendly."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone, I love all the features does a lot more than I expected. I up graded from a galaxy 111. The fingerprint is a great idea, but you have to have your fingertip placed just right. Happy you can use a back up pin too. The phone works without fail. I love the calling features as well."
yes,yes,yes,got it for Christmas and it's been the best phone I've ever had so far
yes,yes,yes,As this product stands it does its job. Compared to the note 5 it is somewhat lacking .

Battery life is decent as well usually get a full day of use out of it and I'm always using it for something , phone call, texting, apps,..."

yes,yes,yes,"I am very happy with this phone, I would like to recommend everyone to please switch from Iphone to Samsung"
yes,no,yes,"I had the Galaxy S6 on my old carrier. So when we swithed to a different carrier, even my wife and son got the S6. We even got a fourth to use as a home phone and for my grandson to play on in the Kid's Mode."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 is great but one down fall is that as of now there is no android 6.0 marshmallow, but i am sure that is coming."
yes,yes,yes,"Ever since I started using the original Samsung Galaxy up to the Samsung Galaxy s6, I would never go back to using any other cell. Can't wait for the next Galaxy to come out."
yes,yes,yes,"The real question is, what can you not do on this phone?? So many features, what you can do with the Samsung Galaxy S6 is limitless. Great multitasking device, very fast, and the picture and camera quality is unbelievable!"
no,no,yes,but software updating issue in my country(pakistan) ..

yes,yes,yes,I have always been a huge fan of Samsung everything! I actually tend to go out of my way to buy Samsung brand a vast majority of the time. My son and I both just purchased the Galaxy S3 32G phones. We both love our phones except we both noticed that the battery drains so fast.
yes,yes,yes,"The music files are an exercise in frustration. When I put in homemade cds I can put them in a folder. But if I try to go by ""artist"" they separate out and also can not be sorted into the order I want."
yes,yes,yes,"Phone has great camera, great screen, great fingerprint sensor, great speaker. The problem is the battery is not strong enough to handle everything that is running in the background."
yes,yes,yes,"best phone I've ever had, solid piece of gadgetry."

yes,yes,yes,This phone is way better than my iphone. Im so glad i went back to android systems
yes,no,yes,"It's amazing what a simple device can hold and store. Not only can the apps & information be entertaining, but beneficial & convenient as well. Being able to use this for communication is one thing. To use this as a learning tool & a guide is another."
yes,yes,yes,"I had been a very loyal Blackberry user for well over 10 years and was very leery about switching over to an Android Samsung. Imagine my surprise at how easy everything was. The camera is much better, the features are amazing, the number of apps available in a variety of subjects and areas is almost..."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the 5.1in Quad Super AMOLED display. It has bright vivid colors and is very easy to see outdoors. The processor is phenomenal! Almost no lag 95% of the time, smooth transitions, and great for gaming. Speakers are very loud and have very great quality. The camera is the best."

yes,yes,yes,"I enjoy the ability to change the themes, the great quality of pictures up can take can't wait for the first snow to capture my dogs playing in the snow."
yes,no,yes,This phone is a much needed upgrade from my previous galaxy. The features and menus are very straightforward and easy to move through.
yes,yes,yes,This is my 3rd Samsung phone after iPhone 4. I bought Galaxy S2 then S4 and now S6. I also have a samsung smart TV. S4 was amazing and had tons of improvements over S2 and now S6 seems perfect. Design / features / looks all are packaged in one sleek device named Samsung Galaxy S6. Loving it.
yes,yes,yes,"After a long wait, I finally went for the s6 and so far I love it. There are still some pros and cons, just like any other devices out there but so far, everything seems to be working well.Pros:Cons:Besides those cons, so far everything is working great and I love my new Galazy s6!"
yes,yes,yes,"It was time for me to upgrade to a new phone so I went with the Galaxy S6. I had the S4 for the past 2 years,it was a great phone but it time for a change. So far everything has been great with the phone except for when the camera failed and one of the antennas for phone signal failed."
yes,yes,yes,"Love everything about it. Only thing I don't is AT&T, because they don't offer WIFI Calling."
yes,no,yes,I am using it for third week now. Everything so far has been satisfying but the device heats up much faster than it's rival phones such as iphone 6 series. It feels so hot when you play a game for about 30 minutes.

yes,yes,yes,I can multi-task on this product. I can have multiple pages up at one time. Love this product

yes,yes,yes,Works so much better than the iPhone I had. Everything is faster and picture is much clearer. Never will go back to an iPhone.
yes,no,yes,"At first, I was skeptical because I am one who loved the removable battery and the expandable storage. Getting a smaller battery in this phone was supposed to be an issue, but the phone battery has been surprisingly nice."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had a 3, note 4, note 5, and now a s6. Each phone gets better and better."
no,no,no,"This product acts up, have to constantly have to update. The touch screen doesn't work at times.."
yes,yes,yes,"I miss having a removable battery and an SD card slot. also the sim card is a little annoying to put in. but otherwise the phone is amazing. it runs fast, the processor is amazing and it hasn't hit slowdown yet even though i've barely had the phone for 3 weeks."
yes,yes,yes,The Gs6 is fast throughout the day no matter what I am doing and has an amazing display that is just an absolute joy to look at. I would like a built-in micro-sd card slot but with the incipio battery/external storage case it doesn't really bother me.
yes,yes,yes,I love this product it has many great features. I recently had a S4 but I upgraded to a S6. I loved the S4 but the S6 is even greater. Would recommend this product.

yes,yes,yes,This phone has an excellent camera and it is easy to multitask.

yes,no,yes,"I made the switch to Windows Mobile, Lumia 1020 a couple of years ago. I was looking for something different and really did like the interface. Plus it had an amazing camera.

yes,yes,yes,"This is a really great phone! I used to have a Galaxy S2 Skyrocket, and thought it was the best ever. The S6 has well surpassed it. I love the style, design, & incredible features.Also notable, for various reasons (mostly financial), I could not upgrade from the S2 Skyrocket for a long time, and..."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 has all the features I need. Large screen, multi preloaded apps, plenti of storage."

yes,yes,yes,"I liked this phone. This one is much better than previous S5, S4 etc. It has a great body and camera. I am love this phone. All I could say is that speakers could have been at some other place but that's not a deal breaker at all."

yes,yes,yes,"this is a great phone, but slippery. wish it had a better battery. Has an amazing camera, but the front camera lags a little, but overall great phone."

yes,yes,yes,Good phone! But I don't like the long requirements for a simple review!!!
yes,no,yes,Phone has a great display and decent sized screen. Needs a good case. I found it hard to hold securely without a good case on the phone. Only had the phone a few days but it's a huge step up from my previous Samsung rugby 2

yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from a note 3 to an S6. I really loved the Note 3, mainly for it's size. I rarely used the stylus, and although I did not avail myself of the option, I appreciated the ability to open up the back to change the battery and upgrade my storage with the note 3.Why did I go with the s6 then?"
yes,yes,yes,"The back is so slippery that the phone will slide even when you would not expect it to. Wish the back glass were frosted or patterned to help hold it in place. Otherwise, the best phone I've owned."

yes,yes,yes,Good phone for great price. The phone has many great features.
yes,yes,yes,"This is our third samsung phone, starting from SIII then, S5, now S6. Of course with each generation of phone, the technology jumps ahead. Still, S3 we had for the last 4 years measures up. That goes to show that what you get with the samsung phone holds up."

I have missed class twice now because the alarm clock feature is incredibly difficult to use (which I know sounds ridiculous, but they got rid of the smart alarm, snooze options, and not as easy to set the times)."
yes,yes,yes,The phone really looks good and i am very excited. All the features of S6 is really good compared to other phone in the market.
yes,yes,yes,"having had only 1 other smartphone than this one i feel that its a great phone to work with it loads everything with ease but the only downside is storage, the phone doesn't have any extended memory slot, so if by chance you fill your phone's memory up you would have to either buy a separate usb..."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the Galaxy S6 phone, I have had the Galaxy S4 for the last 2 years and thought it was a great phone, I bought the S6 about 3 weeks ago and love everything about it. It is faster than the S4, it has so many better features on it than any of the phones that I have had in the past."
yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy s6 is the beat phone on the market. The size of it is just right,not to big not to small. The camera is by far the best. The new processor is amazing it makes the phone run so much smoother. The clarity of the screen is also a great feature."
yes,yes,yes,I have never seen or heard about the features that this device offers. The S6 performs like know device I'be ever owned. This phone is not just a phone it has become my life. As a first time owner I would recommend this device to every and anyone. Way to go Samsung!!!
yes,yes,yes,Awesome performance overall. Great for anyone of all ages. Functions are intuitive so not very difficult to learn the phone's features.

yes,yes,yes,"This is one of the best phones I've ever had. I love the fingerprint scanner. It's so fast and when it charges, just 10 mins could give you 5 hours with 30%. I think I made a great purchase when I got this."
yes,yes,yes,"In moving from an S4 to the S6, I was a bit concerned over losing what I thought were two great features -- a removable battery and an SD card slot.I've only had the S6 for a couple of weeks but so far those items have not been an issue. The built in battery lasts quite well."

yes,yes,yes,only drawback was the lack of option to add memory. i almost went with a galaxy 5 for this reason.

yes,yes,yes,"My S6 is my 3rd Galaxy phone after S2 and S4 and the best one so far. Hardly any bugs. No overheating, quick charging, highly improved speaker, very responsive and high quality camera that beats its predecessors S2 and S4 by far and ease of use are some of the positives."

yes,yes,yes,"A great phone that looks really good but I miss being able to change the battery for a fresh one for when one dies and that it isn't water proof like the S5. Despite these things, it is one of the best phones out right now and I greatly prefer this than that of an iPhone 6."
yes,yes,yes,Everything is amazing on this phone it's just that everyone and a while when I turn on my phone I will have a browser pop up and saying I have a virus on my phone and almost everytime it happens it is a different looking page.
yes,yes,yes,Love the new upgrades phone works great. Tons of apps.
yes,yes,yes,This product is so easy to use. The camera works great and the picture is great.
yes,yes,yes,Fits in my pocket. Good responsive touch screen. Froze on some apps. Wish it had expansion SD card. Wireless charger and Samsung Pay are bonuses :)

no,yes,no,The att version of this phone is bad. Lack of updates. locked bootloder. Lack of languages. iPhone in this case more universal. I think Samsung should make a universal device to be used on any network (GSM/CDMA) just like iphone.

yes,yes,yes,"I recently bought the Samsung Galaxy s6 and I absolutely love this phone. Samsung has really done great job. Well done! keep it-up This phone has great screen, easy to use, I would definitely recommend to everyone in the world. This has been the best smartphone I've ever owned!"

yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone over a IPhone. I like the android apps and operations better. I have always had excellent service from Samsung phones. The battery life is the only draw back.
yes,yes,yes,I switched from an iPhone and I like the size and display better. Not crazy about all the ads though.

yes,yes,yes,Really wish I would have stayed with the notes. Went from a note3 to this
yes,no,yes,"Not sure whether this is a result of a recent app upgrade but, the fingerprint scanner fails most of the time. I have all 4 finger print scans programmed and I will try every one of them and end up with having to use my bypass/alternate password in order to access the phone.This typically occurs..."
yes,yes,yes,Turned in my Samson Galaxy 4 and got my new Samson Galaxy S6.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had an iPhone for the past 4 year and didn't have any problems with it. This past spring I purchased a Samsung Smart TV and fell in love with it. A couple of years ago, I purchased a Samsung stove and love it."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone but while they made the screen more durable they did not make the back at all protected and it's slippery like glass soon needless to say it broke quickly but other than that the phone is awesome and the camera is amazing!
yes,yes,yes,I am not good with new electronics but this phone is awesome. It is really fast. Keep up the excellent work Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,"I used to have a galaxy S2. Served me well and out of the blue i couldn't get to charge, even bought a new battery but it was done so I decided it was time to upgrade. I looked at them all...being that hate change I decided the galaxy S6 was best because it was the best fit for me."

no,no,yes,"Bigger screen, clear display , finger print touch,the battery charges in an hour"
yes,yes,no,"I like the phone. It doesn't have a way to quickly mute the phone other than to just turn down the sound. I tried to set up the alarm to wake me up in the way that I did with my previous Galaxy S3, but the alarm didn't go off. I just need to pay more attention."
yes,yes,yes,"Switched from an iPhone to the Galaxy. Absolutely love it, so glad I switched."
yes,yes,yes,I have had several of the Samsung smart phones. The S6 is by far the best smart phone on the market. The new apps run very fast and I love the apps like the visual phone mail. The battery seems to last much longer. So far I have not seen or experienced any weakness or flaws. Great phone.

yes,yes,yes,I have owned iPhones for six years but this Galaxy is more phone for the money by far. I like the larger screen and sharper resolution which makes Web and watching videos more fun.
yes,no,yes,I like the fingerprint and wireless charging features
yes,yes,yes,I held onto my S4 waiting for a phone that far exceeded it's performance. The S6 wasn't what I was holding out for but I am glad I got it. It feels like quality in my hams and the phone works with a crisp snap.

I can not use my Plenti card and my discount from work has not gone through. Microsoft Edge is not helping."
yes,no,yes,I found this phone to have features that I didn't even think of. I really like everything about this phone. And Samsung has it's own apps that I found to be both useful and down right fun. Excellent product!
yes,yes,yes,"I followed the Moto X line very closely and loved all of its features. When I upgraded, I decided to jump on the Samsung Galaxy bandwagon. Part of me wishes I had gone back to the old Moto, but part of me would miss many things about the Galaxy S6.For starters, THAT CAMERA! It's epic!"

yes,yes,yes,"I own a business, run a non-profit, I'm VP of a service organization, along with raising four children and a husband. Needless to say I'm busy and I need a phone that is easy to use, had long battery life, and that I enjoy using. This was an upgrade from a Galaxy S3, so the feel is similar."
yes,no,yes,"Had a 2 year old Galaxy Rugby. Upgraded because of the larger size of the 6S. I don't see well and the larger size is perfect. The 6S also has many new features, most of which are huge improvements over the Rugby. Great job Samsung!"

yes,no,yes,"I've been using my S6 for a few months now after upgrading from the HTC One M7.

yes,yes,yes,"I recently purchased a Galaxy S6, I had the S3 before this. It is an amazing phone and I absolutely love it. I had the S3 for 2 years and I feel like I was living in the dark ages all that time. The speed of moving around between apps or downloading something is amazing."

yes,yes,yes,I love how you can change the theme of your phone. It also has a great camera I love.
no,yes,yes,"Very pricy, but you know that already."
no,yes,no,"This phone has an unstable platform that Samsung knows about. They're slow to release a fix, that I've seen, that stabalizes the os and prevents apps from randomly closing down."
yes,yes,yes,"Regular features, nothing extraordinary."
yes,yes,yes,"I've always have been a Samsung fan and this has been by far your best phone yet , I mean octa core processor is off the chain . I've never seen something so fast and then the camera with the tracking and how fast you can pull up the camera by pressing the home button twice brilliant."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Upgraded from the 4. Love the size and performance.
yes,no,yes,I traded my iPhone in and at first thought it was a down grade to the Galaxy S3 but I couldn't be more wrong. After getting to the phone and getting to know it I couldn't have been ore wrong. It was a total upgrade
yes,no,yes,"I had a chance to work with one of the major cell provider companies in the USA for almost two years and I was an agent in retail department. For maintaining a job like that and mostly in order to wrap up a successful sale, knowledge about the smartphones in any kind and under each platform was as..."
yes,yes,no,"I received a Samsung S6, 32GB as a work phone.Security: I can't help but play with the device. The fingerprint scanner helps keep my curios children from bothering with the device. The 32GB helps me DL 3rd Party Productivity software with ease."
yes,yes,yes,Great product. the phone is thinner than the later models of the galaxy. love the health feature and the phone lock on the home button.
yes,yes,yes,"With the Samsung Galaxy S6, I was pleased to find that there were a lot of features on the phone for customizing and theme based design. I only wish on that topic that you could pick and choose what parts of certain themes to keep and others to alter."
yes,yes,yes,The design of the phone is slim and beautiful
yes,yes,yes,"Needless to say, my entire life is based around the convinience of this device."

yes,yes,yes,"S6 is one of the best android phones which you could currently buy.Pros: Camera, Performance, Design, Size"
yes,no,yes,"I use to have an iPhone until a couple years ago. I switched to Samsung and I don't think I would ever get another phone. I have had the S4, note 1& 2. I recently purchased the s6 and it is everything that I could hope for in a phone, music player, and computer."
yes,no,yes,Recently I changed from an iPhone5 to this Samsung Galaxy 6S. It is better in every way. Fast performance.
yes,yes,yes,Such a great phone! So easy to use! The camera is amazing quality for a phone! I do wish that the keyboard worked differently.. I switched from an iPhone and I'm not quite used to it yet. All in all though a great phone that I would recommend to anyone!
no,no,yes,"Price is too high. I do not like how system has been changed. I like updated process. This is just a way to get more money. Also protection plan not wOrth it. 200.00 too high of a deductible and was not told t me,at time of purchase"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is very nice of overall. I would like to see a larger battery.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been on an iPhone from the start.... I'm a convert.... and I love it. So frustrating to learn how to use it, but the ability to do so much.... it's great.The camera is wonderful...."
yes,no,yes,I love the camera is so clear

yes,yes,yes,It's nice wish it had a micro SD card slot besides that it's a nice phone
yes,yes,yes,"I have always been a previous iPhone owner and I can definitely say now that I will be team galaxy. The S6 blew my mind with the picture quality, running speed, graphics, and much more. thank you Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,Well when I got my phone I was just dieing to have it this phone is just so great I cannot put it down ever day and night and I just want to thank samsung for all the phones this made especially the s6 they improvedon't their cameras and all that other cool stuff. THANK U SAMSUNG!!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,"I knew I was going to get another samsung to replace my s3. At first, I was going to get the s5,but changed my mind and got the s6. It charges fast, it's quick downloading stuff. The Internet is fast."
yes,yes,yes,I moved from IPhone to the S6. I have no regrets. The phone is sized right and has a great screen. I think the features are as much a part of Android as they are samsung. I do love wireless charging.
yes,yes,yes,good battery life except when you are running a hotspot all day it will only last little over half the day before going dead.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great! The display is excellent and the build quality is great. It also performs well and has amazing cameras and UI. The fingerprint scanner works wonders and the fast charging and wireless charging are amazing features.
yes,yes,yes,"My only real complaint is the cost. But i find that most smart phones are too expensive. Aside from that I love the phone. Though had I waited a month, I I could have gotten the active, which is great of you have kids or animals."
yes,yes,yes,I'm a photographer so I've always said if you could take an iphone camera and stick it on an android I would never use anything else. I'm beyond thrilled to have finally found a camera that beats the iphone!!
yes,yes,yes,By far this is the best phone I have ever owned. The features are so user friendly. Every day I find something that helps me to keep me organized yet still entertaining. I appreciate the help screens when I am not sure of something.
yes,yes,yes,So far a nice phone. Two weeks in and already experiencing some lag when starting and stopping apps and going back and forth between apps.
yes,yes,yes,"I always buy Samsung, because they seem to be the best for features and battery life. The 6 is better than any other phone. Awesome camera and sound for music. Apps easy to use."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has everything! It is responsive and has all the features I need for every day life; a well-built calender app for keeping track of all my appointments and personal holidays, an easy to use email program which tracks all my email accounts, intuitive browsing features and access to all my..."
yes,yes,yes,I bought this phone and fell in love. It stomps all over my old iphone
yes,yes,yes,This is my 2nd Samsung phone (S4) and I am really enjoying it. As many are I am dissapointed with a locked bootloader and the rediculouss amout of bloatware. No SD card is also a bummer but with cloud storage I can get over it. Screen is sharp. Performance is snappy fast. And sound quality is good.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm so impressed with the new features. This device is perfect, you need a camera that takes perfect pictures you have it. You need perfect video you have it. Phone clarity and reception is excellant. Along with the speed of the processor for online activities."
yes,yes,yes,I am very hard on phones. Most smart phones don't last in my line of work but this one has been durable and reliable.
yes,yes,yes,"I've been looking for a single device to fit all of my needs for business and personal use. So far so good, this phone is great!!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"It is a great phone. The only issue I have is with the battery life. Have to restart phone every once in a while to keep the battery from acting up. Other than that, it's alot to love!"
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S 6 is just the best phone out there. The competition wishes they were Samsung. The Samsung Galaxy S6 is so intuitive and easy to use.
yes,no,yes,This is my first Samsung phone. My kids have used them and they always complained about the battery life and other things. So far I have not had any mishaps.
yes,yes,yes,"Switched from Iphone , to Windows, to Android. I think I found the only phone I need now."
yes,yes,yes,It is sleak but the best running phone out there... it can be used for anyone
yes,yes,yes,"I had an iPhone previously and I switch. The reason was because the Samsung 6 phone has a larger screen, the sound is louder and the camara takes better pictures.I still am having trouble using the features on this phone and I don't understand why there is so many apps and what are they used for."
no,no,no,"I have two issues with this phone. If the battery gets hot, the application I am in will freeze causing me to reboot my phone. The other is that the on/off button is very sensitive."
yes,yes,yes,"The main reason I left the iPhone was because of the external storage and easily removable battery of the samsung s4. After upgrading, I find out that neither of these apply to the s6. Major let down... overall it's still a great phone, just without those 2 features I really liked."
yes,yes,yes,The camera definition is perfect! Excellent videos and pics.....impressive
yes,no,yes,"Not one single problem with the phone which is rare,."
yes,yes,yes,Works great. Nice phone. Color good. Camera ok. Could make display larger
yes,yes,yes,The display lighting sound quality of the s6 is amazing. The battery life is pretty impressive also. The s6 runs faster and smoother than my previous Samsung phone. I'm not a fan of the non removable battery and inability to use an SD card.
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung S6 is terrific in its design, light weight and the screen is perfect to see the apps and the dialing keys. The connections to WIFI, Bluetooth etc are easy to manage from the settings."
yes,yes,yes,"I got this phone two weeks ago and i absolutely love it, the camera is phenomenal.the performance and speed is great i would definitely recommend this phone to other users it is amazing"
yes,yes,yes,"I like the phone. The sound quality of the phone itself is terrific. The Galaxy App Store and the Google Play store offer some really innovative programs, however, downloading some of them leads to prompts for other apps, some of which seem to conflict with the pre-loaded apps (I'm thinking of the..."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome. Not basic and has many great features to it. Camera is the best part
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 is an amazing piece of technology, that goes above and beyond its previous designs with the S5."
yes,yes,yes,I had been an iPhone users for years but switched and am not regretting it one bit. Love this phone and how can be customized.
yes,no,yes,It's quicker than my S3 in every way and the screen resolution is insane. It's so much faster and I like the layout a lot more. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
no,no,no,"I've had s6 for about 3 MO and now for the last 2 weeks it has problema with connecting to Mobile network. My wife has same phone and has no problems. Sometimes I can call someone, other times it says emergency calls only. I can text."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing. The camera is phenomenal great processor and a great investment!
yes,yes,yes,This is by far the best phone I have ever owned. Great quality and amazing futures and performance.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from a Galaxy III and I really like the S6. There are so many new features that I am still learning all of them. The battery holds a charge longer than the Galaxy III so I am definitely pleased with that. I think the camera on the III was slightly easier to use.
yes,yes,yes,It is pretty good phone. Best Samsung phone yet. I would much rather this than an iphone
yes,yes,yes,Amazing device has met ot exceeds all of my expectations. Upgraded about 2 weeks ago and have not one complaint
yes,no,yes,"From the moment I removed my phone from it's box, I've been very impressed with everything that it can do. The screen is very clear and bright and the touch screen is highly responsive. I really like the ease of use and how intuitive it is to perform the easiest tasks."
yes,yes,yes,This is my first Samsung device(Galaxy s6) but I've always wanted one and I got to say I love everything about it!
yes,yes,yes,"Being an old geezer, some electronics can be hard to use. Even with my old SIII it was hard for me to type and see what was going on. The S6 is very comfortable for me and the features are great. Don't think I would want any other phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I have always had a Samsung phone. From the sleek flip phone my parents gave me when I turned 15 to the touch screen Eternity when we switched to At&t during my senior year. Then, my Freshman year of college, I got the first Samsung Galaxy and it was glorious."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone yet! It is super fast and the color is fabulous. The camera rocks!!! Sound is super clear, blows the iPhone out of the water 10 fold!"
yes,yes,yes,I love my new samsung galaxy s6. The brand new design is absolutely stunning. I love the metal edges and the front and back glass. It is just so good to look at.
yes,yes,yes,Love all the phone Just one complaint really they took away MHL
yes,yes,yes,"I've been tinkering around with all the functions. For myself, I LOVE the personal assistant I've named Kortana. (Yeah, I know what some may be thinking. However, It's my phone and she responds to my call. =) ) The camera is great, on both sides. FAR better than any Iphone out there."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great very fast and very helpful great with reception it has a very bright screen even at low it has man new add ons the Samsung galaxy s6 is by far my favorite one yet
yes,yes,yes,The back and sides of the phone are gorgeous. The new features are great.
yes,yes,yes,My s6 is by far the best phone I have ever owned.I have owned galaxy phones since the s3.The features are more and better.
yes,yes,yes,Galaxy S6 is possibly the best phone I've ever put in my hands.
yes,yes,yes,"It exceeded my expectations by far! Way better than iPhone! Before I had my galaxy s6 I owned the iPhone 4s which was okay, but I knew I was missing out with all the cool android phones."
yes,yes,yes,Best pictures I have ever taken with this phone. Extremely quick at everything you want to do. Not sure if it's still water proof though.
yes,yes,yes,"I got this phone 2 weeks ago, and I absolutely love it so far. The thumbprint scanner works great, the screen is beautiful, it runs smoothly every time, and sound is crystal clear, even when phone reception isn't great.I was worried at first because of reports of poor battery life, since they took..."
yes,yes,yes,Moved from iPhone to s6.Cons.
yes,yes,yes,I just upgraded from a S3 to the S6. WOW!!! This phone is super fast. Excellent camera and just needs a double tap of home key for instant access. The IR blaster is icing on the cake...no more searching for my remote.
yes,yes,yes,"Ever since I've received this phone it has given me great pleasure because everything is at your touch ! When I use voice , I don't have to repeat my self like the old phones. All my passwords are remembered, I don't have any trouble getting anywhere , Facebook Twitter, all my emails are there Togo..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Very user friendly, but the battery runs down very quickly. I listen to music most days at work and have to plug it in to the charger by 3:00 nearly every day. Otherwise, a great phone. The camera takes great pictures!"
yes,yes,yes,"I hesitated for a long time, using a basic flip-tip cell phone for many years. I finally bit the bullet and purchased a Galaxy S6. Even without the aid of an instruction book, I've been able to intuit the features I use regularly."
yes,no,yes,"Easy to use, battery life good, great screen, and fabulous graphics."
yes,yes,yes,Really like this phone. Love the quick charging. The display is great. Really like the space theme background. Although i wish there were more theme options. I'm still learning and having fun doing it. :)
yes,no,yes,where should had a face-to-face video app like iPhone \u2013 FaceTime.
yes,yes,yes,heats up while in use. The picture quality isn't all that. It just made me miss my old iphone
yes,no,yes,"Ultra sharp display & 4k video would be enouhh , but this thing has serious power and smooth performance."
yes,yes,yes,"Stylish and intuitive, this pone is a breeze to use. The display is incredibly rich in color and all features and functions work as advertised. This phone is worth the investment."
yes,yes,yes,"At first I was skeptical about this phone. It's basically an Iphone with an android interface. We had to say goodbye to the expandable memory, removable battery, water resistance and dust proof features, all of which set the phone apart from the competition."
yes,yes,yes,I had a LG g3 before I got the galaxy s6 and it keeped dropping calls so replaced it with another one and it did the same thing. Now that I have the galaxy s6 I am a happy camper I even have the gear fit.
yes,yes,yes,I FIND THIS PHONE TO BE VERY USER FRIENDLY. I AM TECHNICALLY CHALLENGED TO SAY THE LEAST AND IF I CAN USE IT ANYONE CAN.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone, as mentioned in the review title, is sweet. Love this thing. I used to have an iPhone 4s for about 3-4 years. It was a good phone, but the issue was, as time when on, it got slower. So when the time came, it was either an iPhone 6, or the S6."
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about this phone. It's the best version of the Galaxy series. (I have the S6 now).
yes,yes,yes,This smart phone does everything I want it to. I have had it for 2 weeks and I'm still learning all of the features.
yes,yes,yes,"AT&T service is not as good as Verizon (From where I switched). Features of the GS6 are awesome, however AT&T service makes it difficult to use as a phone."
yes,yes,yes,Most reliable device I have owned. Beats their competitors hands down.
yes,yes,yes,The phone was amazing and worked great much better than the iPhone I had before
yes,yes,yes,"When I got a chance to upgrade to a newer phone I decided to stick with a reliable Samsung Android model and I have yet to be let down! The phone has a great shape and size, a wonderful camera with a plethora of functions and added functions and features which make communication with friends and..."
yes,yes,yes,"While the # of available apps & feature are overwhelming at times from both my carrier and Samsung,I am learning how to find my way with this phone,Ilove it!! It works so much better & faster & clearer than my old ''smartphone'' I am glad & the way I will use it is however is best for me.I am a bit..."
yes,yes,yes,"First let me day that I love this phone...the display is clear, precise, and easily personalized. The only big frustration that I have is the initial security for inputting a password to get into the phone--the screen goes back to sleep WAY too quickly, so that it is very difficult to have a good..."
yes,yes,yes,The galaxy s6 is just absolutely the best phone I've ever had. The picture quality is just so impressive. The design of the phone is surely better then others in the market.
no,yes,yes,"Traded in an IPHONE 6 Plus which was junk right out of the box ! 4 gigs of memory yet the forced Apple apps that came with the phone ( which cam not be deleted ) used up 2 gigs of the phones memory!SAMSUNG S6 has a better camera , more memory and doesn't freeze up !"
yes,yes,yes,I switched to the galaxy s6 from the iphone 5s.
yes,yes,yes,"sential representation of what a phone should be. From it's amazing design, vivid colors, and just the fact that it's so fast are just a few rationales for why I love this phone. Galaxy for life."
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy s6 is super easy to use and lightning fast. The features are fantastic. Battery life is high and very durable design. I would give a 5 star rating on this phone hands down. It is lightweight, the colors are vivid and the display is bright and clear."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new Samsung Galaxy S6, its easy to use and it has lots of apps and nice features that I have never had on other phones. So far its the best phone I have ever had Kudos for making something that people of all ages would enjoy!"
yes,yes,yes,Great display and camera. The battery is the only down fall
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone that I have ever had. I highly recommend this phone to anyone who is looking for a GREAT phone..Samsung Galaxy S6 is definitely a 5 Star Phone
yes,yes,yes,Such a great upgrade from my old Galaxy S3. My 6s is so much faster
no,yes,no,I literally have nothing bad to say about this phone.....
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy s6 is a realy nice phone that is very durable
yes,yes,yes,Still miss some features from my old s4 galaxy
yes,yes,yes,Great features and the camera is the best. The screen resolution is the best in any phone.
yes,yes,yes,"It has good size, weight, and easy to use. Only problem I had was the native messaging app kept freezing from the start."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone!!!! Picture is crystal clear and great features
yes,no,yes,"has great apps performance is very good, has good feel"
yes,yes,yes,The phone is functional and large enough to work with. The screen is crisp and colors are radiant but I purchased a phone and not a TV so I consider this not that important.The phone has average battery capacity. I was really hoping for something better.
yes,yes,yes,Very good pictures and camera like the speaker being in the front easy to use
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great! I previously had a Galaxy Note 3 because I liked the size and the idea of a stylus pen. However I found that I didn't use the stylus pen hardly ever so that just ended up being wasted functionality for me.
yes,yes,yes,Everything else is great and fast. The camera is amazing. The only problems I've seen are apps closing sometimes and large usage of data and location randomly. But these might be able to be fixed.
yes,yes,yes,"Well not exactly, couple of crashes on apps, but nothing to seriously worry about. This phone is an amazing product and is able to keep up with my busy social schedule."
yes,yes,yes,I have had this phone since it launched and I love it. I wish it had a metal casing instead of the glass. To me it feels kind of cheap. Overall it looks sharp. The camera is nice. It seems like it may be slowing down though it tries to focus and it's blurry sometimes. Maybe it just needs an update.
yes,no,yes,A little awkward to handle with one hand. Camera takes elongated photos.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S6 is a great phone. I am somewhat new to using an android phone. With the help of my sister I have started learning all the in's and out's of learning the use of my phone. I am finding new things it can do every day with all he features that it offers.
yes,yes,yes,"I like this phone, it is real easy to use. I am still figuring out some of the features but overall it is a good phone"
no,yes,yes,This phone was great for two days now slow loading and battery runs down quickly. Did software update and loaded several thousand text I had to delete
yes,yes,yes,"Havent had any problems running any game or app. Very fast phone, very smooth play, very light and sleek. Love it!"
yes,yes,yes,"I went to a galaxy s6 from an Iphone. I was a little skeptical but honestly I love it! I love being able to download music fast and easy, plus I get to personalize everything which you can't do on an I phone of course. I would definitely recommend this phone to other users!"
no,yes,yes,"The lack of an external card puts this back for me. If the phone crashes, I lose all my stuff which will make it so I have to back it up manually which is inconvenient and a pain since I do not own a computer."
yes,yes,yes,Love the new glass and color changing back. The imaging and picture quality is sharp.
no,yes,yes,"I've had the phone for about two weeks now and I absolutely love it. The only problem I have is with the S voice app. It doesn't seem to be functioning properly and often turns on by itself, or when I'm having a conversation with someone. Other than that the phone is flawless."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has many great features, my only complaint is the issues I have with receiving texts from iPhone users. I'm a club advisors and have members telling me all the time that they text me the other day and I can't figure out how to receive those texts."
yes,yes,yes,"The gs6 is a great phone in all areas with great brightness, a superb camera, and a crystal clear display. The battery life could be a bit better but it meets expectations."
no,yes,no,"Before purchasing the Galaxy S6 I had a Galaxy Express, which was my first smart phone. The Express worked very well, but it was slow at times, and the camera was terrible. I couldn't get a clear picture no matter how steady I held the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Broke my iPhone 6, so I decided to switch. Love the customizability, and no more fussing with iTunes and hiding unused apps in folders. Keyboard is much better, and the screen is crystal clear. Only qualm is that the battery life could certainly be better"
yes,no,yes,"With a sick display and octacore processor my s6 has blown me away. This was my first Samsung smartphone and I had my doubts but they have all been shattered. From the new theme store to the ability to go from 0% to 100% in less than 2 hrs, this device has something for everybody."
yes,yes,yes,as a samsung user of tv tablets pc and cell samsung to me is the best and up to date in technology and in what customer/consumers want and need for day to day useage
yes,yes,yes,I've had my S6 for about a month now and absolutely love it.
yes,yes,yes,I love the slim design. It's a very awesome phone.
yes,yes,yes,What a difference but find both very user friendly recommend highly
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is high qaulity, fast, and very well engineered to insure longtime use."
yes,yes,yes,"Such a great phone. Fast, stable, and beautiful. Camera is the best of the best, screen is so vibrant and beautiful, and the only complaint is battery life, and even that can ne fixed with battery saving mode!"
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone. It's the best. Security is great. The features are fantastic. I've already told my friends to get one.
yes,yes,yes,All my friends have an iPhone and they envy me lol. My Samsung S6 Edge is AWESOME. I recommended it to all the people that i know...there's not much to say...just the fact that Samsung-Android is number one #1
yes,yes,yes,"As a previous owner of a samsung galaxy SII (had it for 2 years), I was pretty excited to own the latest model. The phone looks great, it's very stylish. Most of the time it looks black but when the light hits it at the right angle, it's turns an iridescent blue."
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from a Galaxy Note to this and OMG is it the best ever. I love it! The battery life is twice what my old one was, the charge time is half, and the applications work so much better and faster. I used to get frustrated with my Galaxy Note, but I'm loving the new Galaxy S6."
yes,yes,yes,"I do like the design and feel. Build quality is great, finally no more plastic. Performance is great, very fast and responsive. Camera on the device is way better than previous model. Screen is bright and crisp."
yes,yes,yes,I lo e this phone. The split screens is nice for trying to work from your phone. The only thing I don't like is that when I first got the phone the numbers and .com button were always up. Now the phone updated and added a swipe typing key that I do not like.
no,no,no,I don't have anything bad to say about the s6 I give it a 5 star rating
yes,yes,yes,I finally joined the 21st century and got the s6.
no,yes,yes,"I believe this product is priced to high at ATT. Also, you lose sound when play games."
yes,yes,yes,"It's simply easier to use than my iPhone was - it's a little less user friendly, but it's much more capable."
yes,yes,yes,I really like my samsung galaxy s6 it has nice performance and great design.
yes,yes,yes,I have had the smart phone that was good but this Samsung is like a Cadillac oh just to let you know I was a flight engine on C5A-Broadway Galaxy
yes,no,yes,"Beautiful phone, design and software.I miss the additional features of the 4 in addition to the smart stay etcetera.I did love the fact that I was able to use the sd card (now useless) and being able to switch batteries when needed in stead of waiting for a charge (purchased extra battery now its..."
yes,yes,yes,This is a totally awesome phone. I still haven't learn all that I can about it. I can't wait to see what I else I can find that is new.
yes,yes,yes,I have always liked Samsung because of the software and models
yes,yes,yes,"I is a good product. I like the camera, but sometimes when I play games such as Clash of Clan it keeps splitting screens. Also the battery life i feel is sub par, but the screen colors are amazing. I am also disappointed there isnt micro a sd card slot."
yes,no,yes,"This phone still needs some improvements. For example when I am listening to a Whatapp voice note, if I pass my hand over the phone without touching screan the voice note would pause. Another example is if I am searching online I would type ex."
yes,yes,yes,People tried to discourage me from going from iphone to Android. I am glad I didn't listen.
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone for the money.The battery life is great and the pictures are great as well.
yes,yes,yes,I was looking for a phone that functions great and I found it
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone itself with it's beautiful glass design really sets it a part from the s5. Before I got my s6 I had the s5 and the s5 has significantly better reception than the s6. In fact the s6 has like no service anywhere other than the main city.
yes,yes,yes,Love my new 6..was a blackberry fan a n d finally found a good replacement
yes,yes,yes,"I would say that this phone is great, but it does lag here and there. The display is amazing, but also I think it might be too amazing, the battery life is a bit shorter that I expected."
yes,yes,yes,I love how this phone works and has excellent integration. Last week I just went to Orlando Florida and this phone completely integrated my itinerary from my trip from the hotel all the way to my car rental and the distance it will take for me to get from the rental to my hotel and it was accurately...
yes,yes,yes,"I was very reluctant to get this phone in the beginning. I didnt think it would have all i ever wanted. But once I got the phone I was amazed. My favorite thing is the camera since i use my phone for everything, the quality for the cam was very important and this was it without fail."
yes,yes,yes,"I went from an s5 to the s6. Super fast, amazing pictures, and super durable. Best phone I've owned so far."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my S6. Of course I loved my S3 also, but a gal's gotta stay current, right? My favorite is when hubby's I-phone won't save a pdf file (like for an airline boarding pass) and he has to go and get one printed because there's no wifi in the airport."
yes,yes,yes,You can do anything on this phone quickly. The camera is amazing. No regrets with this phone.
yes,yes,yes,I have owned an iPhone since the very first one came out and have hated galaxy or any android phone but I finally decided to switch and I can surely say that I will never return to that same old boring iPhone software thats been out for like 10 years.
yes,yes,yes,I've recommended this phone twice due to the Camera. It's an amazing home
yes,yes,yes,"Going from a Galaxy S3 to an S6 was scary at first. I like getting comfortable with an electronic and sticking with it, especially since most electronics tend to be drastically different from 1 to 2 let alone from 3 to 6. I was able to utilize the phone immediately."
yes,yes,no,"I had a really hard time breaking my commitment to iphone. Every 2 years I found myself hating the sluggish performance and glitchy interface and thought it was time for something new, worst case is that I get a new phone in 2 years and can go back."
yes,yes,yes,I think it is an excellent device. I wish battery life was better.
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful camera and camera modes. Amasing screen resolution and easy home layout overall a very good phone.
yes,yes,yes,This is an awesome phone and easy-to-use. I think everyone should have this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Out of all the cell phones I have had this one has been the best. It's a lot faster then others and I can run more business apps this phone is awesome
yes,yes,yes,Great looking phone performance is excellent takes awesome pictures and the charge pad is an outstanding accessory that I bought.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, with very good options"
yes,yes,yes,Love the design and the top notch display/cameras/speed.
yes,yes,yes,Galaxy s6 is the best phone ever. Everything about it is great from the looks to the camera. Great features and battery life
yes,yes,yes,Great features and great battery life. This phone is very easy to use and also a lot of fun.
yes,yes,yes,I love my S6 still playing with some of the features because there are so many.
yes,yes,yes,"I switched over from an iPhone and have had this phone a little over 2 week.s I am really enjoying the device and am very happy with is so far. The camera is great, the design in nice and clean, and the performance has been great."
yes,no,yes,"This is my first Samsung smart phone, and I have been very impressed so far. Many cool features, and the themes for it make it very customizable. Some have complained about lack of removable battery but I've never killed a battery in a day."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new s6,it's more than what I expected. Even time I puck it up I discover something new. I love everything about it."
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy the speed and the many features my phone has. Everyone of my friends I tell them you need to get an S 6 Edge. The screen quality is better than any flat screen I've ever seen. I watched a video and you could count the whiskers on his face.
yes,yes,yes,"It's a great phone,my only disapointment is no hdmi out! Everything else is awesome!!"
yes,no,yes,The phone is amazing i love the finger scanner. It makes sercutiry better for the android phones. One thing I'm still wishing hopping they fix is the battery life on the phone. On my galaxy note 4 the battery would last all day but on my s6 I atleast have to charge it twice for the amount I use it...
yes,yes,yes,I recently made the jump to Android and knew I had to get something Samsung. I've been waiting for the Galaxy S6 for a while now and am glad it's here. The phone is great.
yes,yes,yes,Very pleased so far. Does everything that I need and more.
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 is the phone that I have been waiting for! The display, sounds and features are outstanding! Navigation is smooth and easy as well! The pictures that I have taken are fantastic and sharing them with my family has been seamless!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the speed of this phone, as well as all of its features. The battery and memory management are superb compared to the S3 I upgraded from. My only complaint is the fact that the battery is sealed inside like an iPhone, which is why I only gave ""Features"" a 4 star."
yes,yes,yes,Coming from the Galaxy S3 to the Galaxy
yes,yes,yes,The galaxy S6 is amazing. It's fast and the battery's acceptable. I wish Samsung could bring back some features such as S Beam and DLNA but that's just some minor changes.
yes,yes,yes,I'm in love with this phone! It's the first Samsung I've had (previously had Droids) and I'm definitely going to be buying another Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,I would and have been recommending this Samsung Galaxy S6 to friends and family. I love this phone and my fiance for getting it for me for my birthday. Absolutely love love love it.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this Samsung Galaxy s6 ,because I have features on my phone that other people don't have and the speed is crazy fast , like the speed of light also all of my friends like it when I bring it around 6 of them got it sense I had so I'm like a icon of the phone to the phone to my friends"
yes,yes,yes,Nothing and I mean nothing including the iPhone 6 can match up to this phone. It's slick new design and feel and it's amazing display makes it a remarkable phone. The 3 gb of ram and octave core processor makes it the most powerful phone out there.
yes,yes,yes,This is very nice phone..super fast.. it works so good for my business.. I am so glad I upgraded from the 4 to the 6.... keep up the great work Samsung
yes,yes,yes,"It's a good phone overall. Could be better but it's ok. Twice I couldn't receive calls, only texts. The camera is awesome. It's sleek and easy to hold in your hand. Talk time is also good."
yes,no,yes,"The new galaxy is a great looking phone, but the quality comes at a price. There is no expandable storage and no removable battery. The battery doesn't Last as long as I would like, but the fast charging feature is great."
yes,yes,yes,"I don't update my phones very often, but I decided to get the S6. The transition from my S3 to the S6 was very easy and I enjoy the speed as well as the other new features and ease of use the phone."
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy the opportunities for customizability
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone less than two weeks ago and so far it is an excellent phone. It features many unique and helpful features though I personally would prefer a smaller size and longer battery life.
yes,yes,yes,"Don't get me wrong, I came from the HTC One and this phone is better than it in most ways. There are things I miss about the HTC One (mostly just the news scroller that doesn't require an app to execute)."
yes,yes,yes,"What a great new phone ,bought one for for everyone in my family .had the s3 and thought it was a great phone but the s6 is so much improved from the new body to the new software the camera is just awsome .most complaints i have read is about no sd or cant replace battery but I have had no problem..."
yes,yes,yes,"I always said I would never get rid of my iPhone, but am glad I did! The screen size is perfect, the camera is AMAZING and the battery life is great!"
yes,yes,yes,Love the 2 press camera feature....it's super fast!
yes,yes,yes,I finally took the dive and switched (brand & operating system) to a Galaxy S6. So far I couldnt be happier! The options are incredible. The screen is bright and clear. Camera is perfect! I dont know what more I could ask for.. My only real beef was the price but thats probably because Im cheap.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has got to be the best so far from samsung. I love the fast charging for when I'm on the go because it only takes about 30 minutes to charge fully. Also the quick launch of the camera by tapping the home button is great because I can take great fantastic pictures when I'm on the go in a...
yes,yes,yes,"The power under the hood for this generation was finally a big step forward. The S5, while it had some interesting features, was not significantly more powerful than its predecessor and therefore not worth the upgrade in my opinion."
yes,yes,yes,The speed of the new Samsung S6 is amazing. I love this phone.
yes,no,yes,"I traded-in my AT&T Samsung S5 for this S6, and at first it seemed so familiar/similar to my S5 that I wasn't sure why I changed phones...then, after about the first week with it, I became very happy with it and 2 months later, I am still extremely pleased."
yes,yes,yes,I really like a lot of the aspects of this phone including but not limited to the specific samsung apps. The one thing I wish was better was the battery life with everything this phone can do I find myself on it a lot and I also have to charge it a lot
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung S6 is wonderful in it's speed, apps, photo quality, sound quality, all the things that a mobile phone is expected to have."
yes,yes,yes,"I am an authorized retail sales rep for AT&T and had the opportunity to become the Samsung Advocate for our location. I have used multiple Samsung products including the S3, S4, the new S6 and also have a 3D Blu-Ray player with surround sound at home."
yes,yes,yes,I really love my new Samsung Galaxy S6. I have always had an iPhone and decided to try something new and the release of the SGS6 was perfect timing. I honestly couldn't be happier with the decision to switch over.
yes,yes,yes,So far this is a great phone. I just upgraded from the galaxy s 3 and I am excited to have this product.
yes,yes,yes,I have had Samsung products for years and would never get anything else. Each new device I've gotten is better and better.
yes,yes,yes,very fast no problems much better then galaxy four
yes,yes,yes,I was previously an I phone user and I love the freedom and the features a lot better on my new galaxy s 6 !
yes,yes,yes,Had the S6 for a few weeks now and I love it. Has all the features you could ever look for or want in a phone.
yes,yes,yes,"A top of the class phone that finally looks and feels how it should. Excellent materials of construction make the GS6 the 5-star phone that it has always meant to be.Being a uni-body build forced a compromise on battery life and since I'm a heavy, daily user, I have to carry a backup battery and..."
yes,yes,yes,I've been dealing with a windows phone and didn't know if I would like this phone but I love it. It was very easy to learn. I've had my Samsung for about 3 weeks now and had no problems. The battery life isn't that good but I can deal with it.
yes,yes,yes,This is my second Samsung phone and I am very pleased with their products. I will buy Samsung again.
yes,yes,yes,The phon is light. The phone works well has solid Internet access even outside the home.
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone better than any so for. I recomend this to my family and friends. It has a lot of features and has worked flawless.
yes,yes,yes,Great and amazing samsung galaxy s6 just is a pure beautiful and fine art and my hands.
yes,yes,yes,"The S6 isn't too different than the S5, but if you are looking for a stylish, super-light phone, I'd go with the S6."
yes,yes,yes,"The S6 is a great phone, great design and feels good in my hand. Very versatile and easy to use, in fact the only draw back is battery life, however it will charge in just 15 min. I'm glad to own this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome design, great performance everything perfect"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, better than my iPhone. Camera is great, got some amazing pictures."
yes,yes,yes,the Samsung galaxy S-6 is the coolest phone I have ever had I have been a diehard iPhone user from day one this phone is definitely a iPhone killer I will never buy a iphone again I am sold on the Samsung Galaxy phones the life
no,yes,no,Fell out of my shirt pocket and landed on a small pebble and the glass broke. I thought the glass was was suppose to be strong. Try to repair and the glue is so strong that it broke the display. Phone is not worth repairing because it cost more than just getting another phone on contract.
yes,yes,yes,thend S6 is a great phone for anyone who needs a powerful pocket computer with the added bonus of being able to make phone calls. I alsolove the battery life. The display colors and clarity are the best I've seen.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded to the Galaxy S6 from the Galaxy S3 and I LOOOOOOOVE it. I loved my S3 and only upgraded because it was an option and I'd had the phone since it had first come out. I wavered a bit between the S5 and S6 and ultimately went with the S6. The camera takes a beautiful picture.
yes,no,yes,I upgraded to the Galaxy S 6 from the Samsung Galaxy s5 just because I like to have the latest and greatest phones but in all actuality the Galaxy s5 has better features such as waterproofing and the removable SD storage but I do like the fingerprint scanner better on the Galaxy has 6 also I prefer...
yes,yes,yes,"Everything about this phone has exceeded my expectations. The camera options are better than the S5 I had. The color and picture are clearer than the S5. The sound is clear, but because the speaker is small and in the back, it is hard to hear sometimes.The body style is sleek and stylish and very..."
yes,yes,yes,Loved my Galaxy Samsung 3 and love this one as well. Easy to use. Takes a great pictures
yes,yes,yes,Wish it still had removable battery and SD card slot. Love the water proof feature which is great in Florida weather.
yes,yes,yes,Overall the best phone I've ever owned. The features and ease of use are wonderful.
yes,yes,yes,I really love having this phone over Iphone. It was a great change but is still hard getting use to android. The only problem I have is that the battery dies way to fast for a brand new phone for barley any use on it. Main reason why I wanted to get away from iphone
yes,no,yes,The new S6 has such a clear crisp screen which pairs well with the camera it holds. The picture quality is stunning.
yes,yes,yes,"I loved my s4 but am so happy with my new s6. Light, easy to use, dependable."
yes,yes,yes,"In my opinion the galaxy s6 is the next big thing,the s6 not only looks good but feels good. s6 has great graphics that make gaming, reading, and looking at videos awesome.The s6 has great featuresnot only for playng but for safety.Taking pictures, and taking videos with the graphics, and its..."
yes,yes,yes,"Glass and metal galor, the first thing I thought when I picked this phone up the first time. And then I turned it on... Most beautiful screen I have ever used. As mentioned before it's battery life is subpar, although expected in a flagship."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is really simple and fast, I can easily use it to write notes and keeping up with news. It has a fantastic camera and of course cool samsung applications."
yes,yes,yes,I just got the phone and loved it unfortunately I lost it I knew where it fell and in less than 5 minutes my phone was taken. However in the short time I had it i fell in love. I am unfortunately back with my old iPhone until I am eligible for an upgrade. Lesson learned: purchase the insurance!
yes,yes,yes,My Samsung galaxy S3 went out of commision and I upgraded to the Samsung galaxy S6. I love it! It blew my expectations out of the water and couldn't be happier! The one thing that iso a downer is the price. A little steep for me but oh well!
yes,yes,yes,So far the phone has been performing great. I am getting used to some changes from the S4. The battery life is great.
yes,yes,yes,I wanted to test the Galaxy's 6 out after years of using the Iphones. It is a Great phone exchange and don't think i'll switch back. The features of the this phone are Great!
yes,yes,yes,"this is my first phone and I love the design,the performane ,and the features.I love this phone a lot ."
yes,yes,yes,I work for ATT and have tried multiple phones from different makers to different OS and this is my favorite phone so far. The camera is insane and the phone is a powerhouse. My only complaint is battery seems a little weak compared to other phones but updates can fix that.
yes,yes,yes,"I really love this phone i used to be a iphone user, but not anymore"
yes,yes,yes,"the phone is really fast and smooth, the only issue i have with the phone is a yellow tint on about 75% of the screen, other than that it is perfect"
yes,yes,yes,I love me galaxy s6. I love the apps and the whole interface. It works great and i love all the different apps it has. I actually like this phone way more than my iphone 5C. I have and would definitely recommend this phone to anybody.
yes,yes,yes,"I am happy, only issue i have is that I don't have the removable SDcard. Other than that....I LOVE MY PHONE!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the look, performance and quality of this phone. So easy to use, and i love that it has so much space on it for downloads like my pictures, music, etc."
yes,yes,yes,"Anytime I get on the Internet or downlaod apps, the website pops up almost instantly and the apps download really fast. I think this is one of the best phones I have owned and I have owned A LOT of phones. The features that come with the phone are great."
yes,yes,yes,so far I love the camera. easy to use and brilliant photos.
yes,yes,yes,"Having upgraded from the Galaxy 4, I found the 6 to be easy to use with most of the features of the 4. It is very slim and easy to carry, even in a case. The screen is very bright and easy to use in the sunlight. Sound quality is also very good."
no,no,no,This product needs more revisions done. Poor reception keeping and poor sound qualities. There are unnecessary features on this phone but inhibits the products performance.
yes,yes,yes,"I give the phone an overall 5 star rating because it is just so great all around. Features gets 3/5 stars due to Google Now's ""OK Google"" feature being limited on this phone, and it appears to be Samsung's doing, which is extremely irritating."
yes,yes,yes,I am an ex Iphone user and are very pleased with the Samsung platform. Thoroughly pleased. Never shall I touch an apple product again. I hope. Keep up the technical advances and I won't. :)
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome display, Incredible performance, lightweight but a powerful phone. The only thing I don't like is it is marketed as Black but anyone who isn't color blind could tell you its Blue. Even the headphones that came with it are spectacular"
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new phone it is fast and easy to use. It is like it thinks for you, my phone has almost every thing you could ask for."
yes,yes,yes,Hands down the best phone in the market right now.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is a different experience from the rugged s4 active that i began with. The speed is a great but I miss the water resist because I use my phone on the job all the time.
no,yes,yes,The only issue I have as of right now is I accidentally deleted the Facebook app and tried to get it back but can't . I'm not able to uninstall to reinstall the app and I don't know where or how to get the Facebook logo back onto my phone.
yes,yes,yes,Everything is absolutely amazing about this phone. The only problem will be coming up with 'the next big thing'!
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 is a top-notch device. The phone is very fun to play games, great at multitasking, and takes AMAZING pictures. It also has one of the best displays on any smartphone. The only downside the phone has is all the AT&T pre-installed apps which, to me, are unnecessary."
yes,yes,yes,Hands down best phone I've ever had. The amoled display is beautiful and the 8-core processor is extremely fast.
yes,yes,yes,"From the start my phones have always been Samsung from the first until know, I haven't been let down by the phone itself, the carriers is a different story. My husband has also join the amazing Samsung family. We both love the S6 and are satisfied with the phone overall."
yes,yes,yes,"Right out of the box fell in love with this phone, the sleek gorilla glass back and talk about fast, my apps run so much faster now. Love the quick battery charge really comes in handy. If your looking for a new phone this is the one to buy."
yes,yes,yes,"I was skeptical about battery life before buying the S6, but after having it a few weeks I have to say power has never been an issue. I also so far don't miss the SD card support. It's a beautiful phone and it runs smoothly."
yes,yes,yes,"Great product. the best smart phone I ever had. great camera, calendar features are great!. The battery life is sweet. like the wireless charging system. The S Health app is great and I love it"
yes,yes,yes,"This is my first smartphone after 15 years or more of the flip-phone. My kids made fun of me for being old fashion, My birthday came and my wife got me the Samsung s6. I am so glad she did! Its not scary like I thought and pretty easy to use. I learn something new with the phone every day."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. The screen quality is amazing and it comes with tons of features.
yes,yes,yes,"After years of Samsung unleashing new Galaxy models, each unique in different ways, they have decided to reinvent the Galaxy lineup and put it all on the table. The Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy Edge are here to cement the Galaxy series in history. I personally own the S6 model and I am blown away!"
yes,yes,yes,i think this product is a good one i just wished i was able to get the EDGE
yes,yes,yes,"Before getting the galaxy S6, i actually still had the S3. And that was for about three years of replacing the battery at least twice. Although the phone did slow down, it was sad to upgrade and see it go. But as soon as i saw my new S6 out of the box, i was greatly impressed by the designs."
yes,yes,yes,Button positions much better - less tripping wrong button. Clarity of screen is excellent and with larger screen can have plenty of information viewed at once. The Recent Apps button is a good shortcut when using multiple apps in short succession. AT&T and Samsung have but this unit together well.
yes,yes,yes,Haven't had it long but its been ok so far. It doesn't seem as sturdy as my S-4. It works different than my older S-4 and I need to get use to it. Doesn't really seem that much different. Screen doesn't even look better. Maybe it will get better as I learn to use it.
no,no,no,Bad idea going away with the memory card too much like iPhone can't place signature on text
no,no,no,"No doubt this is a masterful device capable of taking on the iPhone Universe. But this is only true IF you keep the wi-fi turned off. Battery life suffers from enabling wi-fi, so to support that beautiful screen, be prepared to use all your data OR have it charging at all times.Also when this gets..."
no,no,no,"The phone is slow responding to entry of pass code. If you do it normal speed, it misses the first one or two numbers/characters and it comes u with an error. You have to enter it really slow to get it right the first time."
yes,no,yes,Great looking phone with above average battery life. Fast charging ability is nice. Phone does turn on by itself in pocket at least once a day though and the action buttons are quite sensitive which will sometimes hamper watching video or playing games.
yes,yes,yes,"The new S6 has a very fast interface, responsive touchscreen, great speakers, great call quality, and the power to do everything I need to get done during the day. The charge lasts a good deal of time, considering the larger screen size."
yes,yes,yes,I love the new Samsung S6. I like the way in fits in my hand. The screen resolution is beautiful. The best phone Samsung has made!
yes,yes,yes,I am extremely happy with this phone. I originally had a S3 and was happy with it I can't believe how much better themail S6 is. The picture quality is great the speed is awesome I have no complaints.
yes,yes,yes,The s6 is great for every purpose. It has a good display and camera.
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic spprd, easy to operate with long lasting battery."
yes,no,yes,Best every phone which in my opinion rate better than the others.
yes,yes,yes,"Great features and more that I have yet to discover.I do wish there was an easier way to capture a screenshot. Too easy to minimize apps with current method.Speaker placement is still poor, but better."
yes,yes,yes,"I'm a fan of samsung, they make all the best stuff. Samsung S6 works great. My favorite feature back my previous S4 is that the speaker is no longer on the bottom of the phone. Better audio output!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is fantastic. I love the fact that it has wireless charging and with the fast charger I rarely have to worry about battery life. I use the phone for a ton of media; between steaming video and audio I do find that I need to charge my phone once throughout the day.
yes,yes,yes,Overall the Samsung S6 has good features including an excellent camera. I do wish the screen was a little smaller because it is hard to text when my thumb can't reach the entire keyboard. I love using the S Health app. Unfortunately there seem to be some bugs that have yet to be worked out.
yes,yes,yes,The design and feel of this phone is incredible. It has a high end feel to it. It's easy to use and fast as well. I highly recommend this phone.
no,no,yes,"Well, here I am with another Samsung S series phone. I did miss it but it's starting to bring back old memories. My S6 is less than 2 weeks old and I've had to reboot it several times because it wasn't either sending text messages or the data wasn't working. Once I rebooted, it was fine."
yes,yes,yes,If you have the s5 keep it! It's much better than the s6 unless you just want it for the camera upgrade. Which is just ok
yes,yes,yes,"This is by far the best phone I've ever owned. The screen clarity is absolutely amazing. Much better compared to my Samsung Galaxy s3. I was nervous at first about being unable to remove the battery and not having a sim card, but I have had not one issue about this since I have been using the phone."
yes,yes,yes,I have had the Samsung Galaxy S6 for two weeks now and am in love. From the fingerprint lock keeping my children off my phone to the amazing quality video that this camera takes. The glass and color are sleek and beautiful.
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone, really have enjoyed all the capability and features. Also the ultra power saving mode has saved me already on a few occasions. In general though, it does go through battery quick and so you'll need a charger at work and elsewhere."
yes,yes,yes,"I had the galaxy s4, but I waited until the s6 came out before I upgraded. It was well worth the wait. The s6 is an awesome phone, very user friendly. I recommend this phone to everyone."
yes,yes,yes,Just trying to get used to how fast this phone is! Love it!
no,yes,no,"I purchased the phone roughly 2 weeks ago, and I am quite satisfied with my purchase, but there is 2 major problems currently with this phone. One problem is the memory issues, it seems the phone is consistently at 80% ram usage even when no apps are open, which greatly annoys me."
yes,yes,yes,It is going to be getting used to the new format and multitasking compared to my old galaxy s4 but overall it is a great phone.
yes,yes,yes,The galaxy 6 is a solid android phone. The only recommendation that I have would be to have a notification setting where there can be sound but not vibration.
yes,yes,yes,I still have not used all the features but I love what I have seen so far.
yes,yes,yes,I wasn't sure about this purchase because it seemed like a lot of money. I do not have a contract so I paid for the phone all up front. My last phone was a Nexus 4 and is the only other comparison I have for smartphones.
yes,yes,yes,"Had an S5 for less then a year but after doing a LOT of research on the S6 I used my wife's upgrade to get the S6.Really nice phone, fast, nice looking and lives up to all the hype ..."
yes,yes,yes,It has great new things on it like the themes soo awesome very easy and very organized!!!
yes,yes,yes,"So much better than iPhone, camera is amazing, screen is tremendous upgrade. Can't be happier , went from galaxy s4 to this."
yes,yes,yes,"Screen resolution is so sharp. External speaker is a great improvement from the S4. I've had mine for a week now, and the battery life is more then 1 day."
yes,yes,yes,I have had and relied on a Samsung Galaxy S3 for several years now and it has worked flawlessly.
yes,yes,yes,I have owned an iPhone for about 6 years before switching to the Galaxy s6 this year. So far I love the different features and the design! There are many ways to personalize things to make it work best for me and I love that!
yes,no,yes,"I've spent some time with the New Galaxy S6 and I have nothing but good things to say. The size and shape are perfect for me, it's just a little bigger than my S4 I had and has a more blocky case. The screen is bright and crisp, and this thing is packed with a fantastic front and rear camera."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, very fast, nice design, awesome screen, good camera! The phone is sealed you can't replace the battery and there's no SD card slot. I knew this going in and it wasn't a deal breaker for me."
yes,yes,yes,"Though it doesn't have SD slot and water proofing, the s6 is fast and the camera is amazing."
yes,yes,yes,Samsung is always been my favorite. I like the size and the speed. The camera is excellent. Battery life is good even though the battery is smaller. I was a little concerned but now pleasantly happy.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung S6 is the best smartphone on the market today. It surpasses the iPhone hands down.
yes,yes,yes,Almost every aspect of the Samsung GS6 is amazing. Screen has beautiful and deep colors. Fingerprint scanner works in split seconds. Apps run and load incredibly fast. Only downfall of this device is the battery life.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm still learning the features of this phone, but, it appears that it will be a wonderful aqutition."
yes,yes,yes,I could not be happier with a new upgraded phone. I am not a techie so getting a new phone is always a challenge but this one was very easy to setup and use. I found the email sync to my AT&T email really easy and very convenient.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is the best Samsung phone yet. It has everything anyone would want in a smart phone. Beautiful design and terrific performance is the keystone of Samsung. Great product.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the features on my Galaxy S 6 phone. The speed is great and I am able to split the screen so that I may use two apps at the same time. The battery last for a really long time when you use the different power saving modes, moreover you can charge it for ten minutes if the power is low and you..."
yes,yes,yes,I had an s3. The difference is astonishing. So much faster. Better features. Camera is light years better. I am recommending to all my friends.
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. Phone does everything that I would want in a phone. Battery is great so no worries about the removable battery. Waiting to try the wireless charging even though I hear it is great. No worries on removable storage as I havent put a dent into my 32 GB's.
yes,yes,yes,I really love this phone. I upgraded from a Galaxy S2 Skyrocket. I am enjoying everything about the phone. It's very sleek. The picture is amazing. The pre-installed Samsung apps are fun to use. My only tiny complaint is how slippery the phone is but a case will solve that.
yes,no,yes,Bought this after the screen on my S4 got totaled.But the glitches are too numerous to go into:Just a disaster so far....may be time for an iphone.......
yes,yes,yes,"Better screen res, smokin fast processor, very good battery life, + many new features, and it put my Ipad out of business..."
yes,yes,yes,"The S6 has exceeded my expectations in just about every way. The phone is super fast, has a gorgeous screen and really is a pleasure to use. The first thing I did was play around with some of the touch wiz stuff like the launcher."
no,yes,no,Camera never stays in focus and also make a weird buzzing sound every time I open it . Battery life is horrible . As soon as I take it off the charger at 100% it automatically drops to 99% . I have been a Samsung user sense the s2 and have not had problems like this before .
yes,yes,yes,"I can't get over the speed, screen clarity, power, etc.. I had an SG3 and loved it. I skipped a few generations knowing there was something bigger in store. This is it. Camera is awesome, videos are crisp and multitasking is a breeze. Phone feels good in my palm and looks even better."
no,yes,yes,"While if it functions as it should it's a great phone. My experience with the S6, constant rebooting, system hangs, system shuts down no restart.I am going to buy a more reasonable phone that actually works.This device has been an all around bad experience, I doubt I will ever buy a Samsung phone..."
yes,yes,yes,Better than expected out performed my previous Samsung phone by leaps and bounds
yes,yes,yes,"I recently had a system update and like the changes except for one thing - the functionality of controlling a playlist that is active from the lock screen is gone, why? That was a great feature. So much so that I am thinking about removing the update."
yes,yes,yes,"This cell phone, fits with me, can do many things at the same time, love the camera, resolution, etc...its great..."
yes,yes,yes,I have the galaxy s6 and wouldnt trade it for the world.. well maybe to get the s7. But i love Samsung products. I have been a loyal customer for about 2 years n have a Samsung tv and phone. I love them both and my warranty is amazing. Never had a problem.
yes,no,yes,I absolutely loved my Galaxy S6 UNTIL it was stolen. This was my fourth Samsung phone and countless phones over the years and never had insurance. (Three Samsung tablets)So sad. I went back to my Samsung Galaxy 4 and will wait for another day to get a new one.I will wait for the holidays to decide.
yes,yes,yes,Easy access to apps and features. Great camera and video features.
yes,yes,yes,Great gigs nice clors themes definitely one of the best phones ever
yes,no,yes,"Samsung messed up when going from S5 to S6. I loved the S5s durability and changeable battery. Was almost dreading changing to the S6, the only saving grace was the advanced features. Just wish they would combine the best of both designs."
yes,yes,yes,"I've owned other Samsung products, but never a phone. My family bought it for me as a gift. I am in love: lightweight, slim, screen large enough to actually see, speed, and Samsung's many apps and features that make me love my new phone that much more. It also has a fabulous camera."
yes,yes,yes,I would not recommend buying a Galaxy S6 through Boost. The service really sucks. It's extremely slow and you don't receive them of your calls but as far as the phone goes it's truly amazing. Answers almost any question you have and the pictures are so beautiful.
yes,yes,yes,"I just switched from iPhone. I expected to struggle with the change (having been a apple user for many years). The Samsung was easy to use, the battery last much longer than my old phone and I liked the larger work surface. I am definitely a convert!!"
yes,yes,yes,"This is the fastest phone I have ever owned. I love the phone camera features - slow and fast motion, surround pictures and others. I have the 64 GB version and it has all my music and photos.Great phone."
yes,yes,yes,There are several things that I love about this phone. The one that I am focusing on now if the camera. This phone takes the best photos than any previous phone that I owned or used (including other phones by leading technology providers).
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S6 is a great smartphone, I can do anything that i want to. Easily connects to my College email and curriculum!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the style and it suits all of my needs as a hand held device. Calls are clear, pictures are beautiful and I love the size and constant updates without my having to search for them.I would recommend this phone to everyone."
yes,yes,yes,"Pretty good phone, I'm own few Samsung products because have very good quality"
yes,yes,yes,Well nice job Samsung. I really enjoyed using this phone. And will definitely recommend you.
yes,yes,yes,I thought this was a great phone. It is light and looks very nice but is also quick. I do wish it had a bigger battery but the fast charging makes up for it.
yes,yes,yes,Always like samsung products i have owned s3 and s4 phones so there are no surprises with the s6 and using a andriod phone. I like the size of the phone big enough to read the phone but not to big to put in your pocket. The notification drop dowm pane is a nice touch.

yes,yes,yes,Love how the samsung galaxy s6 perfomance i would recommand the phone

yes,yes,yes,"Beautiful phone. No lagging. Has a great surround sound speaker. You get used the to the large size of the phone pretty quickly, but it can be bothersome with the touch screen buttons near the home button when playing games or watching videos. Pretty good camera if you have a steady hand."
yes,yes,yes,I have tried android devices in the past. My Samsung s4 was okay. I finally bought a Galaxy S6. For the first time I don't carry around two phones. The S6 Is the most amazing phone I have ever tried. The resolution is breath taking; I stream all the time.

I consider myself pretty techy, sot his phome is totally up my alley. Im considering getting the next model for my personal phone now!Love this phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"My galaxy S3 was to slow and upgrade for a Samsung Galaxy S6. I think I made a good decision, I have this phone for a month and I loved, bigger pixels in the camera, more room in the internal memory, I like everything in this phone,but the price!"

yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my Samsung Galaxy S6. It has so many Advanced features and does so much more than any other phone I've had in the past. I especially love the fact that I can control all my other Samsung products with my phone. It's my number one choice if someone asked me about it

yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung, is amazingly personal. The features seem to point out percision and elegance while working and browsing for my clients needs. When I get stumped the apps start flying at me and I tackle and eleqiently handle my complication at that time learning something as I go."

yes,yes,yes,"I like all Samsung products, they are so much more convienant for me to use. But I especially love the S6, the design is so unique and the features are amazong. It runs really smooth. I honestly thought that I might have some problems with it because my carrier is Boost but it didn't."

yes,yes,yes,It's been lagging and a lil slow on my 4g network. But maybe it's boost mobile that's been lagging or maybe I used up my data? But other than that this phone is amazing and I love it and can't wait till I get the$175 deductible fee to get my phone back. Because of someone stealing it from me.
yes,yes,yes,This is the best camera for Android smartphone to ever hit the market simply amazing. The next best thing about it is the theme store to customize your whole phone by the push of a button. I also love the fast charging capability.

yes,yes,yes,This phone is not what I was expecting. It has great graphics and performance is exquisite. It also has a very great camera that takes very clear and vivid pictures.
yes,yes,yes,Since this phone came out I wanned to get it because in the advertisments sounded pretty good
yes,yes,yes,I've had the S6 for about a two weeks now and it's definitely one amazing device the battery life could have been better but aside from that there haven't been too many problems. Definitely earns the 5 stars

yes,no,yes,"I wish I had purchased the S5 instead of the S6. I don't like the glass back, it's just too slippery. And I don't like that the battery is not removeable and that there is no SD card. I do like the sound on it and the coverage, so far, has been great."

yes,yes,yes,"In almost every aspect this phone is great, I am currently on my second s6 due to a bad battery drain, force closure on fingerprint scanner, notification lag ( I press on a notification and it takes up to 6 seconds to open the app) . Camera is great, display is great."
yes,yes,yes,This product seems Nice. One thing I would reccomond is having more colors for the product.
yes,yes,yes,Overall the Galaxy S6 is a good phone. One thing I hope Samsung updates with the phone is the text message app. I do not understand why there is not an option to hide the text message notification. You are able to see the person name & entire message in the notification bar.
yes,yes,yes,"if i knew it did not have the expandable memory like the s5 and s7 i would have never got it, i ran out of memory in a month...i'd rather not have all my pics on some cloud nor on google... the messages did not group chat either as the s5 did, huge bummer."
yes,yes,yes,This product is really great. The features and design are awesome
no,yes,no,I like the phone a lot but there was an issue with taking video the video would drag and stutter until you reset so there is probably something is wrong with a SIM card or with the camera itself I'm not sure.

yes,yes,yes,"Samsung are hard to beat when it comes to electronics and the S6 is amazing! Crisp display, a camera that is par with well a camera (lol), snappy cpu and a sleek look, Not too big to fit in your pocket and not too small to be squinting your eyes."
yes,yes,yes,I truly love my galaxy s6. It's fast and does a lot of things my old phone didn't.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this product, however I wanted to upgrade to a s7, but CrIckett Wireless informed me that I would only get $150 maybe $200 on a phone I paid over $500 for only 1 year ago."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the best phone that I have ever had. I do like the roomy 32gb on board memory, but my only issue is the lack of an SD card slot. Otherwise, it is a great product."
yes,yes,yes,"Have been samsung fan for several years, this my second phone and love all the great featused, too many to list"
yes,yes,yes,"I used to think my last phone was the best, but once I switched to the S6 I realized that I am doing more on my S6 then i have ever done on the other one. everything is much smoother and the picture quality is outstanding."

yes,yes,yes,"I have purchased my galaxy s6 a few weeks ago switching from a iPhone and it took me a minute to get used to it but it was worth it. It has a beautiful build, a wonderful camera, little to no lag at all, and tons and tons of features to use and learn."
yes,yes,yes,I went from a s3 to this s6. By far one of the best phones ever. I wish the blinking notification lights would stop going off when you have the do not disturb feature on. And I wish the battery lasted longer. But other then that. Best phone ever.
yes,yes,yes,"Its a good phone, except Cricket will not release the Marshmallow updates for the phone, which makes the value go down in my opinion."
yes,yes,yes,"nice phone, nice picture and very easy to follow instructions or download programs. the best the battery charge very fast."
yes,yes,yes,"I got this phone a little before the S7 was announced. If I had waited a little longer, I would have gotten the S7 because of the waterproof feature. My friend dropped her S6 in water for less than half a second, and the phone died completely, In my opinion, the waterproof is the only thing missing..."
yes,yes,yes,five stars all the way if you can afford upgrade do it excellant by all reviews on my account thanks samsung!!

yes,yes,yes,Wonderful feature great phone and simple to handle and work with it. Reliable
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy 6 is an amazing phone. I have not had any problems with any Samsung product. I am able to personalize it any way I like. I was a little worried that there was no memory card, but... 32 GB, is actually a lot more room than it sounds!"
yes,yes,yes,I am so happy to have gotten this phone on so many different levels. .. the camera is awesome. .. love the different features and how easy to use... well money spent. . The only bad thing is my husband said I have to wait at least a year to get the next one .. :(
yes,yes,yes,"Pretty good phone, the best phone I have so far..."
yes,yes,yes,I have enjoyed my S6. It performs very well on the Cricket unlimited plan. I would love to see the battery last a little longer since I usually have to charge at least once during the day. I think that is mostly because I am constantly using it and all the great features it has.
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S6 is a good phone, all in all. I would recommend it."
yes,yes,yes,As a laymen to the whole tech world I feel vindicated when I reach for my Samsung Galaxy S6. I have been a Samsung fan since the Galaxy 3 model came out. I wouldn't give up my Galaxy S6 for 100 Apple I phones.
yes,yes,yes,"I really like my new phone, and like almost all of its features. There are only a few things I have an issue with. The phone has no SD card slot, so you only have the amount of memory that comes in the phone. Another thing I don't like is that you can't remove the battery."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone its amazin. Preformance is great and I love all the features the phone has.
no,yes,yes,I put my setting for finger prints and it reads that's it's in finger prints security but doesn't do it unless I just restarted the phone. Also my ringtone and notification sounds will not stay on the tones I choose. Basically the phone uses the setting it wants to use I guess.

yes,yes,yes,"I had to get a new phone right away and the galaxy s6 was the only smartphone in stock. I was not disappointed at all. The camera was a lot better to take photos of my son, quick internet, smooth transition between apps, and very sleek design."
yes,no,yes,The camera is really good in less than optimum conditions
yes,yes,yes,I never had a smartphone before. I only had a flip phone and was hesitant to upgrade because I'm not too tech savvy. The Galaxy S6 was so easy to use. Now I'm wondering why I didn't get one sooner. I just love it!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has a great camera and reasonable storage, but it should be expandable. Doesn't lag and has useful features thatbmake it easy to use."
yes,no,yes,"I changed to the Galaxy S6 specifically to be able to use Samsung Pay which is supposed to work at locations where mobile wallets requiring NFC will not. The hardware of the S6 is excellent, easily as good as the major competitor."
yes,yes,yes,I used to have iphone 5s then i switched to galaxy s6 its just a great phone .. it worth all money
yes,yes,yes,"When I first laid eyes on the galaxy S6, I fell in love, the touch of it, the design. Everything about it took a place in my heart... I love my phone"

yes,yes,yes,Very good product is very good light and very durable battery
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I have ever owned. It has perfectly clear screen shots and I love the camera options there is so much more you can do with this device and I love it.

yes,yes,yes,I have always bought Samsung products..this is my first time buying the galaxy s6 and I love it...

These aren't designed for phones, but are really good on the S6.Features I think can work better are the power button (mine got stuck and I'm..."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone! It's a little smaller than what I'm used to but the features are awesome!
no,no,no,"I've had this specific phone for about 2 to 3 weeks, so far I've had a couple of bugs with Android 5.0.2, WiFi sometimes wouldn't work, RAM is pretty bad (apps would be open but would be reset upon accessing them), and lastly battery life *Those who aim to get this phone, take the battery into..."

yes,yes,yes,This phone is an amazing phone i love having it the only complaints i think would be how quick the battery drains but with the power save mode for those low battery or not fully needed times and its amazing rapid charger it works perfect and ocassionally has an issue connecting to gps but only far...
yes,yes,yes,This phone is simply amazing. Everything works as expected. Very snappy. Beautiful display. Tons of customization options. Very good headphones included. Charges super fast (just an hour and a half from 1% to full). Best camera in a smartphone yet. Great OS.

yes,yes,yes,I've waited a long time to get back to Samsung... they didn't let me down with the S6! Everything about it is amazing!! So many amazing features with this phone!!
no,yes,yes,"This phone seemed great at first, it had really good specs, a beautiful design and a very nice display. It worked great for the first week, but after that it only got worst. There are many flaws with this phone to the point were i hate using it even though i need it for everyday life."
yes,no,yes,"Even thought it is believed that this smartphone is not waterproof, it has many features that fill in that spot; for example, the camera is clear and gives better focus than iphones. Also, the performance is outstanding and there haven't been any problems."
yes,yes,yes,"The only problem is battery life, like all smartphones on market"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the design,the performance, the camera is the best one ,has great colors"
no,yes,yes,"The biggest selling point for me, the durability of the phone, was a great letdown. I was persuaded away from the S5 due to favorable talk about the gorilla glass - my screen broke within a month! The battery rarely lasts 5 hours with frequent use."
yes,yes,yes,I'm in love with this phone. It's quick and just simply amazing. Hardly need any apps for this phone.

yes,yes,yes,"I love this Galaxy. I'm still learning the phone but, from what I do know it's amazing. The camera on this phone is way better then any camera on a phone. Even the front camera is anazing"
yes,yes,yes,everything with the phone is great the only dissconfort I have is that it has 3gb ram but it's consume by app's I do not even use so they should improve that
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung S6 is a great phone, even though you get a sense that it isn't spectacular. I wish it did facial recognition for logging in, though it is pretty fast. I do miss the settings button, though it is useful how the buttons work on this one."
yes,yes,yes,Man I love thus phone it's clear fast camera is amazing I love the split screen feature just overall a great phone. I'm so happy I got my S6
no,yes,yes,"For starters the battery life last less than the S5... Since it cannot be switched.. I have to be near an outlet all the time. It's not water proof... The new glass is extremely sensitive, for the first time in my life a broke a phone by sitting on it in the first 3 days.."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone for a month now, I love it! It is so easy to use and has a lot of features. You can customize it to the way you like it."

yes,yes,yes,"This is my first Android, and I'm in love. I really love the large screen and bright display. (I also like the ability to *not* have the home page so cluttered with icons.) I appreciate having the 'back' and tab/window commands on the sides of the home button."
yes,no,yes,"I had this phone a few weeks ago, I was worried about the built in battery and the 32GB space (keep in mind you can use 25 GB) but the Microsoft One Drive service with a 100GB space for my HD pics and videos it's just what I needed to have my space clear in phone running in the whole capacity, but,..."
yes,yes,yes,Galaxy S6 has a great performance. Processing speed is amazing when managing multiples applications or internet sites at the same time. Also the screem resolution and its camera is just amazing.
yes,yes,yes,"I have both had Samsung phones, and even sold Samsung phones, never bought one until the s4 but I can say that the samsung galaxy s6 is the very best phone that I have ever had the camera is snappy the processes fast Thank You Samsung or going with your own processes, the display is the best display..."

yes,yes,yes,Very good product! Love it. Will recommend to family and friends.
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone with excellent camera and design! I expect nothing less from Samsung
yes,yes,yes,Phone has not given me problems since I bought it. Been over a year and still running strong. Only thing is the battery runs quicker than usual but I guess its normal when your phone gets older.
yes,yes,yes,"As said in the title, this is a fantastic device with flaws. First off, the display is super clear and the camera produces stunning photos. Way better than my old iPhone 5c. The device runs buttery smooth on Marshmallow, and has a load of features that iOS doesn't have such as a theme store and NFC."
yes,yes,no,My phone seems like it always runs HOT.
yes,yes,yes,This is my second Samsung cell phone. These phones are designed well. They have a good look to them and a smooth feel. There are many apps on the market and this phone works seamlessly with most of them. There are enough features (wallpapers & themes etc.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is AWESOME. You are able to split the screen and work from both. The best thing I love is how you can have certain content on the screen and use google to have a closer look.
yes,yes,yes,"However, I LOVE this device! I am the person who usually enjoys being one or two iterations behind on technology, bu, I am really glad that I decided to upgrade to this phone. It is intuitive and connects every area of my digital life, form my computer, to my tablet, to my calendars!"
yes,yes,yes,"This is not my first Galaxy. Between my husband and I we've each had Galaxy S4, Galaxy S5 and Galaxy S6. I am anxiously waiting for the time I'm eligible for the new Galaxy S7. I count on my phone for everything! My whole life is on my phone."
yes,yes,yes,"One simple feature is the ability to spell a persons name when dialing and it brings up the contact.Excellent battery life, slick fingerprint security."
no,no,no,"I had a Galaxy 6 for 9 months and loved it until it suddenly stopped working. Would not turn on. Insurance replaced it, but I think it should have lasted longer than 9 months."
yes,no,yes,"Coming from the Htc M9 was like night and day. At first, I really didn't like the touch wiz because I wad used to sense, but after a solid 2 weeks of use, Amazing!The camera rocks!

yes,yes,yes,i love everything really. i love that i have so much space on it
yes,yes,yes,Its many apps that are not used or have no purpose to some customers like the news breif or play books play games smart switch beacon manager peel smart remote samsung print servicesome customers might but i find some of them pointless and samsung doesn't let you use data while on the phone like...
yes,yes,yes,"I've always been a Samsung person I've never owned an Iphone, but to be honest the phone its great but the battery and chargers are horrible.. ive had this phone for about a year and a half and I've lost track of how many times I've had to replace the phone chargers..."

yes,yes,yes,I really love the GS6. I'm sure I don't use even half of it's capabilities. Great sound. Extreme clarity.
yes,no,yes,"The camera quality is great and provides that always available camera. I am a photo enthusiast and count on my cameras for major shoots, but the S6 comes through time and time again for quick snaps. Text and email meet my needs nicely and email coordinate flawlessly with Gmail."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is adaptable and has great features, the microphone seems a little low when talking to people but other than that its a great phone. Wuld recommend to anyone."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had other phones in the past, and this product has been the best one ever. It takes beautiful picture, all the features are easy to use. And the help staff is a plus."
yes,yes,yes,Pretty nice phone but the battery life has issues. It also tends to overheat when case while charging.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone and generally tend to like most Samsung products. However there are a few issues. One is the fact that when I first purchased the phone the screen would just go black for no reason. Later, I found out this was due to the phone requiring a restart periodically."

yes,yes,yes,"Greatest phones ever, you have everything you need in a phone"
yes,yes,yes,"I've been an android user for quite a while now and I really do love my galaxy s6, its great for work and also play too."
yes,yes,yes,The only complaint that I have with this is the inability to remove apps.
yes,yes,yes,"Got it when it first came out, loved it instantly. Unfortunately now it loses battery very quickly, but that might be due also to the applications on my phone. Overall a great phone and cannot wait to upgrade to the S7. Love Samsung products, always will."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the S6! It has features that I find new every day, It is everything you could want in a SMART phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded the phone to S6 from S3. I feel great of for the decision. The phone is much faster than the rooted S3, of course, but to the point I never think of. This phone never slows down. I don't need to uninstall any app to remain the smoothness. The camera is great."
yes,yes,yes,"The pictures on this phone are awesome, very clear"
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. Easy to use and the memory space is grate. Would of loved it to have a place for a memory card. But still overall its a grate phone.

yes,yes,yes,"This phone meets allyour needs. All apps like camera,audio are very distinctiveI am very happy with it."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung: you have built a excellent product. Your phone is so much better in every aspect, from design to easy use. I can't wait until my contract is up in a year and get the water-resistant S7. It is nice to see a company that takes pride in its products. We also have your TV's."
yes,yes,yes,The only thing that i see and feel is wrong with this phone is the battery. You have to charge everyday. And cant play games on the phone because the battety isn't good. If you do choose to get a game downloaded you have to play it with the phone hooked up to the charger.
no,yes,yes,"this phone is great , but i have to charge alot . the battery drains really fast ."
yes,no,yes,"I know it is last years top of the line phone, it performs well, the only thing that i have a problem is that when using the VR features, the phone overheats quickly, but i guess it was not designed with the VR stuff in mind,"

yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love Samsung and at first I was nervous about getting the S6 but now that I have it I am happy to have uprgraded. It's super easy to use, even 4 year old nephew can use it to watch his shark videos. The camera is amazing and has captured some amazing moments of my 3 month old nephew."
yes,no,yes,"I am still trying to get used to the phone, but it seems to work well."
yes,yes,yes,I've had a Samsung Galaxy phone my entire life. I would never choose to use any phone other than this one because of how easy it is to move through its apps. The features makes it easy to do almost anything and it never frusterates me or causes me any stress. Great product. Best Phone.
yes,yes,yes,I'm not great with computers especially setting them up but this one was easy and if you are a computer person you will fly through it. It's light and I can read the screen. I recommend this to everyone. It has everything I need and downloading is fast.

My next purchase is going to be a laptop and if this phone is this good then I can only imagine how good a laptop from...
yes,yes,yes,"I have had the s6 for half a year and I can easily say this phone has been good to me overall. Pros: So many features, crisp display, great camera quality, good battery lifeCons: Can often be slow when used for a while. Lots and lots of bloatware."
yes,yes,yes,I like all the normal android features... but I truly love the great camera on my galaxy s6! Id love to have a Samsung tablet too....
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love galaxys but, the s6 has by far been my favorite! I love the fingerprint option its the best security yet. I also love that that option lets me log into everything other than just unlocking my phone. I also like the extra apps added to this phone."

yes,yes,yes,I love Samsung products most of all. Each phone gets better and better. There are always bugs to work out but they are more related to the apps then the actual phone. Like since the last update I can't install fonts on the phone but its not a deal breaker.

yes,yes,yes,Compared to my s4 minu this is such a better phone.
no,yes,no,"This phone is most likely very comparible to the other phones on the market. My particular phone has a glitch that is most likely repairable for a person that knows these phones. The issue is when someone sends a text it may come immediately or two days later, many times I have to reboot the phone,..."
yes,yes,yes,I like my phone easy to use but I would Love the Edge
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is excellent at everything it needs to do: camera, performance, build and , security. The only thing the phone does ok is the battery life. Sure it charges very quick which is REALLY useful. Everything else has held up for the past 5 months."

yes,yes,yes,I have had a Samsung since my very first phone. I started with a Galaxy S4 and kept upgrading and now I have the S6. Which is by far the best smartphone on the market behind the Galaxy S7. The features are amazing and the new way that you can open the camera makes it so you never miss a shot.
yes,yes,yes,Bottom like the S6 is a great phone. My biggest problem with the phone was that Samsung took away the removable SD card. It was initially a deterrent but it didn't take away from the features of the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I've been told by a lot of my coworkers and friends how wonderful this phone is (and the series). I didn't think much of it because it was expensive. My first smartphone was a Samsung Galaxy, the first one. I was already impressed with the design and function. It's simple to use."

yes,yes,yes,I really love the picture quality and speed of the processor.

yes,yes,yes,"So far, I don't really have anything negative to say about this phone. The only real negative in my opinion is the lack of external memory available. I wish it still had the sd slot, especially since most of my music and photos are on an sd card."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had the s3, s5, and now the s6 and when my lease is up for this one I'll get whatever is new at the time. I have no doubt samsung will continue to deliver top notch products. I literally have nothing bad to say other than I wish I wasnt so clumsy so I could take off this bulky case and see the..."

yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy S6 is a fantastic phone, everything about it is sleek and high performing. I actually use the S6 before my Note 4, its just something about the feel of it just seems right. Apps run very smooth and camera is astounding. I highly recommend the Samsung Galaxy S6."

yes,no,yes,I've been a Samsung user since the S3. Every time a new phone is released they improve on the design and functionality. My only complaint with the S6 would be the battery life. My S5 would last all day and by bedtime was still at 40%. My S6 gets charged almost 2 - 3 x's a day.

yes,yes,yes,"I had an iphone first and though i liked it, it was not compatable with what i use my phone for, which is like a computer. I constantly download recipies and other information and i love that i dont need special conversion to apple apps to do it. Its all right here."

yes,yes,yes,"When I first purchased this S6, I was completely satisfied by the HD display. Of course the first thing I checked was the camera which, I later noticed had an UltraHD recording function. One unfortunate setback, however, was the fact that it sometimes lagged after some use."

yes,yes,yes,I was hesitant to switch to the S6 from the S5. The S5 was in my opinion better because it was water resistant and the charging capabilities were better.

yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone,the features, the camera, the app"

yes,yes,yes,I like everything about this phone. Great camera quality.

yes,yes,yes,this is by far the best phone Samsung has came out with only flaw is you cant add removable memory and you cant take the battery out

yes,yes,yes,"The only thing that I can say is wrong is that this phone is not water resistant like the S5. I have a 1 yr old, I need that extra protection. Plus, It doesn't have the mini SD slot. I need to be able to expand memory. Hopefully I won't max out my memory as I usually do."

yes,yes,yes,The galaxy s6 phone is great. The technology is pretty easy to understand and easy to navigate.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been an ""other"" phone maker for some time and love certain things about the that companies software. After a not so great year, I decided to go on the hunt for a new handset, I had tried the Samsung's earlier (s-3) but didn't get one."

yes,no,yes,"I'm a bit overwhelmed by all that it can do. Took me a year to get used to my S4. Maybe more to master this one. Had to buy new accessories 'cause it""s a larger size. Won't fit in my shirt pockets, or my pants pockets. I really can't afford to buy new clothes. Hmmmm,"

yes,yes,yes,"This phone is just beautiful and it's the best phone I've ever owned! However, it has one problem, and for me, it's kind of a big one. It turns off all the time. Well, not turn off, maybe more like some kind of sleep mode? But it isn't supposed to, and I can't make it stop."

no,yes,yes,Only two problems with this phone. One being the phone fell off a table (table out a couple of feet off the ground ) and received 2 hairline cracks in the top of the screen which completely ruined the phone. The commercial for this device is deceiving so I highly recommend buying a case .
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone to take advantage of Sprint's unlimited data and fell in love with the platinum gold model on display. I recently had an iPhone 6 on AT&T and while I loved it, this phone can do so much more. The camera is top-notch, and I didn't know a screen could be this good."
yes,yes,yes,Love this device. I will never be bored again. Multi tasking is now easier than ever.

yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone, but I wish it didn't have a back glass case, and I could have added the additional battery/memory card."
yes,yes,yes,The color and design is great. Like how it feels in my hand. It moves through screens quickly. Only thing i can't figure out is how to change the touch sensitivity for this phone. I looked under settings and could not find it. Oh and i don't like the ringtone choices.
yes,yes,yes,"Everything about this phone is great. From the new, sleek design, to the fast performing processor it has. It comes with fast charge which is extremely useful in situations when you only have a small amount of time for a charge."
yes,yes,yes,I love the HD cameraand screen. There are some features On my S4 that I miss like the menu button instead of the recent tabs button but honestly one of the best phones I have owned so far. The phone is sleek and I love the pearl back. And i definitely like the finger print security feature...
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from the S3 to the S6, and might I say what an upgrade. The Galaxy S6 is the phone of the future it has all the newest features including built in wireless charging. (No more pesky cords)."
yes,yes,yes,"I get the most amazing pictures ever,"
yes,yes,yes,"The s6 is better than the s5, definitely worth switching!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. My old phone was horrendous so this phone is like a godsend.

yes,no,yes,The features on this phone are easily accessible and quick to use. Like the fact that all pages can be close at the click of one button.
yes,yes,yes,"Love my new Samsung S6 phone, it's easy to use and has loads of apps. The picture is nice and it has a lot of great features. A+"

yes,yes,yes,"I had the Galaxy S3 and loved it. Time to get a new phone, all family members have Iphone, should I get one too? NO WAY! I love my Samsung S6 phone! I think it is easy to use, fast and functional! I love all of the pre-installed apps, the theme store is fun to switch things up."
yes,yes,yes,I am impressed with this phone. Not that my opinion should carry n e weight with anyone. I am just a man sharing my thoughts about a impressive phone.
no,yes,yes,"This phone is a great! The only downfall in my opinion; is that there's no external memory. If I had known that from the start, I would have gotten the 32GB version instead."
yes,no,yes,Out of all the phones I've had this is probably my favorite I don't think I will ever switch to something else!
yes,yes,yes,I love it there is virtually nothing you can't do on this thing

yes,yes,yes,I really like this phone. It works great and quick all while keeping it simple and easy to use. I'd recommend it to anyone. Best phone available.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm basing my review on comparison to the S4, which I was using prior to the S6 and before that, the S2. Yes, I love my Galaxy phones!First, the features that are missing, neither phones had a way to turn off the ""camera click"", which I find annoying."
yes,yes,yes,I previously had a Iphone 4s. The Samsung 6 performs better has a much bigger screen more memory better photo capability. The only draw back is the battery life. It tends to overheat and doesnt last a full day. Otherwise i love the Samsung 6.
no,yes,no,"the screen freezes, wont text, always having problems with voice texting."
yes,yes,yes,Just got my new phone and I will have to say that I love it. I am the last one in the family to get one and I am having a lot of fun taking pictures and joining the smartphone life.
yes,yes,yes,This product has great features but my favorite would have to be the speakers. The speakers are loud and clear.
yes,yes,yes,"Ever since i upgraded, i just love my new phone works awesome, has great features"
no,no,yes,"The battery should last longer, it runs out very very quickly. Also, it should have memory card slot so we can expand it more. Other models have this feature, I don't know why you eliminate it."
yes,yes,yes,The picture quality is amazing. It takes better pictures then my DSLR.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It has a big screen that is vivid. The quality of the camera is insane compared to other phones I have had. The speed and performance of the phone is amazing as well. The only negative is that the battery life stinks.
yes,yes,yes,The only issue I have is battery life which as I have read in many reviews that seems to be an across the board issue. I will say if I keep power saving mode on that helps. Overall love my new phone and will never stray from Samsung again!!!!!!
no,no,yes,"I recently upgraded my Samsung S4 to the S6 when my carrier, Sprint, told me about WiFi calling. I had been having to use a booster (Airave) in my home in order to get any connectivity in my home."
yes,yes,yes,Love Samsung phones. This phone is very responsive
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung galaxy s6 is a awsome phone! I like the,way it looks & feels. The features on the phone are great! People say a non removable battery is a downside but this phone works well. The camera takes good pictures and the sound is even better I would recommend this phone to everyone!"
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 is the best phone on the market. This phone combines speed, vividness, and quality to provide a smart phone experience unlike none other. With such a sleek and thin design, its hard to grasp why every person in the world does not have it."
yes,yes,yes,"I switched over the the galaxy s6 from a tired old Iphone and was absolutely blown away. It does everything I could want and more, I haven't touched my laptop in the entire time I've had the phone, plus the black with the blue hue looks great."
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about this phone! Great camera. Super fast. No lagging. Excellent memory. Best phone on the market

no,no,yes,my phone cracked the first day i had it. not durable at all...
yes,yes,yes,"I am now on my second samsung galaxy S6 64gb phone. They both had WIFI issues and a poor battery. I went to Sprint, Geek Squad, Samsung reps, and Samsung. All are saying that the new android update causes wifi issues. It does not have an expandable memory and the phone feels cheap."
yes,yes,yes,The camera is awesome and has many different settings.
yes,yes,yes,"Always had Samsung, then I went to iPhone. So happy to be back with Samsung. Will never switch again."
yes,yes,yes,"This is an excellent phone! The camera is wonderful and it's fast and I can play games on it that I didn't even have room for with budget phones, not to mention the beautiful screen and great CPU/GPU combo. I now have NFC, a webcam and thank you Google for unlimited photo storage!"
yes,yes,yes,Love my galaxy! I had the 4 then i just got the 6 an its great. I love that i can do all my social media an downloads rather easily. Easy to use an charges fast. Love that when im on something an i get a txt it shows up at the top an doesnt take over my page!!
yes,yes,yes,"Coming from a Galaxy s5 to a 6, I could notice and I really appreciate the changes and modifications. Moves so much more seamless, and the new design is awesome and sleek!"
yes,yes,yes,I had a S5 and upgraded to the S6. It was a great step forward in ease of use and screen clarity.
yes,no,yes,"This one is actually awesome great display, the built-in speaker pretty loud nice. The only thing bad i can say is that the phone gets hot.."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent features, lightning fast response time, sleek in design. The only reason I have it four out of five stars on overall rating is the battery. I wish it lasted longer."
yes,no,yes,THE BATTERY LIFE IS GOOD. THE COLOR IS NICE. THE PHONE IS LIGHTWEIGHT AND NOT HEAVY WITH A CASE.
yes,yes,yes,"I have to say by far, my s6 has surpassed my S5 in everyway imaginable. I love this phone! It's fast, and it has learned what I like quickly. I miss my sd card slot terribly, but I can't wait for the S7, maybe it will come back."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone!!! I admire the HD quality and the long lasting battery. I like the finger unlock its easy so my sister doesn't break in lol. The camera is so clear and beautiful. The wide selfie camera amazes me the most so easy it captured my whole room.
yes,yes,yes,I have been a samsung user since the samsung galaxy s2 came out. They are great quality products. The one problem with the galaxy 6 is that it occasionally does not recognize sim. Also sometimes while charging the phone will get extremely hot.
yes,yes,yes,"What's not to love. Its got a crystal clear everything. It takes beautiful pictures. For me, its easier to use than other phones in my book. I wish it had something like facetime onthe phone and then it would be perfect."
yes,yes,yes,The phone is very good
yes,yes,yes,"The performance and build quality are the best, period. I've simply never given this'd phone something it couldn't do, and it looks slick.The battery struggles to last a full day, unfortunately."
yes,yes,yes,The features are great. I'm learning more about them everyday.
yes,yes,yes,I could not ask for more from a mobile device. The design is brilliant and I love its weighty feel. 5 stars.
yes,yes,yes,Samsungs6 is the best phone.The camera is the best feature. I love how durable this phone is. It is made of iron i have never seen a phone made like this.I would never want an iphone again. My galaxy is easy to use i love all the features. SAMSUNG products is the best.
yes,yes,yes,What a phone! I have had for three months and am loving it.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been waiting to upgrade for a while. I researched many phones and heard great things about the Galaxy S6. I took a chance. I am experiencing the ""new Phone"" learning curve but the Galaxy has been so user friendly. I love the feel of it in my hand."
yes,yes,yes,"I had the Galaxy s5 for a year and it was to date the best phone I had, as well as the longest I had without it breaking. When I was due for an early upgrade I was kind of skeptical because I heard the S6 did not have the water and dust resistant ability that the s5 had."
yes,yes,yes,It's awesome. Its fast and easy to use. My battery last pretty good even tho im an active user
yes,yes,yes,What can I say? Text and call without pressing a button. Mulitple windows fast speed beautiful image. Clear sound. And a Great Camera I've used a iPhone 6 and a Galaxy 6 and IPhone Is just a basic Click and talk.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has been good overall, but it is clunky. I have had a lot of issues with freezing and in performance overall. It doesn't always run the apps and things I am trying to use."
yes,no,yes,I like the processor speed and the idea of storing everything in memory (no SD). The battery drain seems better to me than on my S4. I like the charging information that's given while charging (time to a full charge). I'm concerned about not being able to replace the battery.
no,yes,no,"If i could go back in time I would have never got this phone. I have had it a little over a month now. From the day i got the phone it has not worked to it abilities. No incoming calls, cant use 3g or 4g so my phone is so slow."
yes,yes,yes,"I have been an android fan for years and this is my first Samsung ( I know ) and I can do everything with this. I didn't want to give up my last phone because ot worked well and the speakers were good but when I heard this phone, I was sold."
no,yes,no,"I like the phone however, it needs a software update to remove the voicemail notification when there is no voicemail. When using themes phone moves slow."
yes,yes,yes,this phone is great because i didnt like the iphone 4 and 4s because iphones are a bunch of trash phones.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is much different from the S5 because the layout is much cleaner and more modern, the physical aspect of the phone is much sleeker and the ability to open the back was removed, as well as the processor of the phone being much faster. Definitely a phone I would recommend to anyone."
yes,no,yes,"Although I've been an iphone user for over five years, I am sold out with the features on my new Samsung Galaxy 6. The many customer friendly apps and overall easy to learn technology is a winner in my book. Samsung user for life."
yes,yes,yes,"I moved from a GS3 to the GS6 and love it very much. I am not always impressed when I upgrade to a new phone, but this one I am happy with. Camera is great and very quick to access. Handles the LTE much better that the GS3."

yes,yes,yes,"It is a great phone with many great features, overall performance is great but using skype is a little iffy."
yes,yes,yes,I love the keyboard! That's just one of the features I love about this product. I just love the phone itself. When I wake up in the morning it's the first thing I grab for. The pictures I take are so clear and sharp.
yes,yes,yes,"Love a great selfie picture? Then this is your last stop.I have never,ever, left a review on anything!!!This include my favorite books...but after I got this phone, I have decided that others out there, need to know how I feel about this phone, and how much I love it."

yes,yes,yes,"With lollipop 5.0.2 , it's a great phone to have for gamers and people who just likes a fast-clean phone with no lags at all. This phone is a big improvement to my older phone i had. It has one of the best camera quality for smartphones out there."
yes,yes,yes,"Loved the phone, it handles great but kinda gets buggy and slows down tremendously. Not to mention it over heats in less then 5 minutes of use. Its slippery but comfortable in the hand, everything else works fine."

yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy6 is the best phone EVER. Highly recommended.
yes,yes,yes,"My new upgrade from the s4 to the s6 was the very best decision i have made when it comes to picking the right cell phone. I love the way it looks, the way it does just about anything a lap top or pc can do, but the difference is it goes everywhere i go."
yes,no,yes,"I upgraded from the S5, I liked the S5 better, this phone does not have the ability to put in a sd chip :( the other down side is no ability to send contact information via text.

no,yes,no,I gave this phone an overall rating of 3 stars for a few reasons. This phone has a glass backing that easily shatters and renders the phone useless. Also there is no place to put an SD card for more memory. You have to buy a phone that has more memory already in it.

no,no,no,"I have seen that others had this problem after I started experiencing it. Less than a month after I got the phone, the touchscreen stopped working properly. I am waiting on a warranty replacement from T-Mobile, but in the meantime I can barely use my phone."

yes,yes,yes,The S6 has a great battery that lasts much longer than my former S3 and takes less than two hours to recharge. I like the look and the sleek feel. The apps are easy to use and the software is very user friendly. My only regret is that I purchased the S6 just few months before the S7 arrived!

yes,yes,yes,"It's a great phone, super snappy, I like the design, great camera, and I could go on and on. The one weakness is the battery, there has to be a software update or something that can at least make this battery last a little but longer. Otherwise a great phone."

yes,yes,yes,"this phone is amazing overall, does not freeze ever. runs perfectly.. i give it a 4 star rating only because of the ram usage and battery life..things that can be fixed with power savings mode in a way but other than that i love my phone hopefully an update will fix my issues and this phone will ve..."
no,yes,yes,"I love this phone however, the battery life is far below what I expected out of a powerful phone. It freezes and I often lose my work due to the screen freezing. My stylus, one of the reasons I chose this phone in the first place, has already broken and I have to say, it was a little disheartening."
no,yes,yes,"I have only had my Samsung 6 for 2 weeks and have experienced the voice command constantly opening while I am watching a video, checking a text message, or right after I open the phone. This is quite irritating."
yes,yes,yes,This product is amazing. It has so many features that are just great. I upgrade from a galaxy s3 and I loved it. Suche a great upgrade.
yes,yes,yes,"I just upgraded from a s4 to the s6 and let me start by saying it's a phenomenal phone. The display is as crisp as we've come to expect from Samsung, the phone is lightning fast, and wireless charging is my new favorite feature."
yes,yes,yes,My phone is great and easy to use. I love the features and functions of it. I love the design. One complaint that I have is that the phone has a lag time when moving from application to open application. This is ok but I wish it flows smoother kind of like the iPhone.
yes,yes,yes,"Let me start by saying that initially, I was skeptical because I am not a big fan of Touchwiz, but this time they did it right.Design: Flawless, this is the most beautiful piece of technology that I have ever owned, in a mobile device."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is awesome I don't know what I would do without it
yes,yes,yes,"The design of rhis device is great slim light and stylish,the octa core processor and great power to this device it doesn't freeze y works really fast,camara is awesome with 16mp in the rear and love the new 5mp front camara now selfie are high quality and have a great HD display."
yes,yes,yes,"What it really make me change to samsung was the camera, photos are so amazing, ... totally recommended."
yes,yes,yes,The phone as an overall phone has great value features and the phone is a good phone the only thing I don't like about the phone is that it dropped calls that it that speaker is on the bottom but other than that the phone is a good phone I would recommend it to anybody that wants a great phone and...
yes,no,yes,Its really cool I like the new format update it would be nice if there were better themes to it . It does tend to be laggy from time to time but thats whats usually expected from most samsung products from my expertise.
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely adore this phone I actually purchased two one for me and one for my mom and we both love the phone it is very advanced I think a little too advanced for us somtimes lol, but we are enjoying getting to know it! Thank you for creating such a great product!"
yes,yes,yes,"I have always had limited use of data and phone use on all phones I've had previously had. Samsung Galaxy has really thought about how to reach every customer's needs. The camera and video has best quality, can stream online faster, and can listen to a wide range of music through milk music."
yes,yes,yes,This is an amazing phone. It's fast. It charges fast. It doesn't freeze. Takes absolutely amazing pictures. Great apps. I highly recommend this phone (Galaxy s6)
yes,yes,yes,"Overall I like my Galaxy s6. Excellent camera, nice selection of apps, and caller ID notification is a great tool."
yes,yes,yes,"Really enjoy this phone on so many levels! It's a beautiful phone, very powerful!"
yes,yes,yes,"I've had every galaxy phone, so there really is no learing curve. It's easy to use. The camera is great, has so many features, and the picture quality is incredible! The sharpness of the screen on the phone is amazing! There are just so many features! It's A great phone, easy to use."
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely love this phone! Right when I thought that there could be nothing else to improve on, Android surprises me again with its slick new S6 look and the apps are great for me and my daughter!"
yes,yes,yes,I really love the quick charging. 1 hour to go from 20% to full... I really like how fast it is with switching between apps.
yes,yes,yes,I love how this samsung s6 is fun to hold with its simple design. The phone has an amazing screen is with its vivid colors and smoothness. The camera is top notch amazing. The front camera beats everything!
yes,yes,yes,The display is amazing and the speakers are outstanding!
yes,yes,yes,"It's the best phone to date. Apples to apples it's a galaxy. Oranges to oranges it's still a galaxy. Apples to oranges, there's no comparison."
yes,yes,yes,"I switched from the iPhone and I'm really happy about it. Android is way more customizable and streamlined with Windows. Sometimes there are little nuisances like autocorrect doesn't fix words if you hit send or if you add punctuation, among other things, but overall I'm happy about it."
yes,yes,yes,I love all the features and how much more memory this phone has over my last phone.
yes,yes,yes,Would recommend to a friend. Extremely satisfied with this device.
yes,yes,yes,"I don't usually write review since I always had problems with my previous phones, but the Samsung Galaxy S6 has been my best yet. What struck me was the performance since it was able to run smoothly through any app without almost no problems."
yes,yes,yes,Well it fricken expensive but it is pretty sweet. It's not quite fast enough and I am really disappointed that it does not have MHL.
yes,yes,yes,"I""m an Android girl so, overall, I really like the Galaxy S series.However, the S3 was the best phone by far. Neither the S5 or S6 are good at predicting or remembering my text or cadence like the S3 was. Also, the S6 battery has not lasted a full day since day 1."
yes,no,no,Let me just start off by saying that I had an old and outdated android phone. It was so bad and super slow so I decided I wanted a new phone. I worked my butt off for 4 weeks until I finally had enough to get the Galaxy s6. Let me tell you that phone changed everything.
yes,yes,yes,"I usually don't rate phones due to the fact that I have not had good luck with them. But I have to admit that the new Samsung S6 holds up. The battery life lasts longer, I am able to take great pictures, as well as talk and text without getting cut off. I really love the features on this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Again, completely satisfied! Just like the awesomeness of the Samsung Galaxy Note 4, the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 capitalize on all of its predecessor best features and then some. From the build quality to optimized software, I'm in love!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone has great apps and I love this phone. Would recommend that you buy this fine phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I was a little leary at first, but this phone is super easy ready to give you whatever service or info you need. Speak feature is ultra-exquisite, makes it fast to get anything answered and even ""capture "" your photo without pushing button!"
no,no,yes,"I only bought the phone about a month ago, and I have already noticed that it lags significantly, and I am sure it is due to the memory capacity always maxing. The system memory takes more than 60% of total memory which is a ridiculous amount of bloatware."
yes,yes,yes,My sole complaint is that my previous phone had an easy to use front facing light app or widget. I can't seem to find that on this one.
yes,yes,yes,"I used iPhone over 5 years and switched to Samsung recently. Friends of mine refered me to switched to Samsung and I found they were true. I am happy to use the camera, no more I need to carry my heavy camera for photographs I need for my news, reports and articles for the newspapers I work with."
yes,yes,yes,"Camera....awesome, gaming ability....awesome, heart beat sensor and finger print reader......awesome. The phone looks awesome, sleek design and not too big to hold but comfortable for landscape gaming. Split screen mode, awesome. Camera....beats iPhone 6 camera..... awesome again."
yes,no,yes,I love my new samsung galaxy 6. It shoots the clearest pictures and videos ever which is what i mainly will use it for when i go to see my friends bands perform and live concerts. Its so lightweight too.
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy is pretty cool, but ""if"" the phone had a removable back and better cooling then it would be better"
yes,no,yes,"I've been using Samsung Galaxy devices since the s3 exclusively. I loved them for everything they were, warts and all. The s6, however, brought a lot of changes, big and small to Samsung's flagship device, and it feels so far removed from its predecessors as to be a completely new device.Bottom..."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S6 is a great phone I love the size it's rich texture and how things are categorized automatically however; it is missing features I have become accustomed to having in the S3.
yes,yes,yes,The best phone ever. When they say smart phone they really mean ut. I love the 3D pictures you can take and share feature.
yes,yes,yes,"to be honest I am not 100% happy with my phone. I switched from an I phone to the Samsung 6 and I am having a hard time figuring it out. I can not get all my emails, phone calls, important information for work. I thought with all of the great apps and such, this would be a sure winner."
yes,yes,yes,"I love it for many reasons example I have my own ringtones,my favorite wallpaper everything I need is there I mean app.Thank.TMovile."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone because it's very easy to understand but the s5 I like better for the movement with your hand without touch the phone
yes,yes,yes,"To me a reliable and solid sound putting cell phone would have to fill certain requirements for my investment. I'd consider the ability to modulate it, such as changing the internal microSD or perhaps up-gradable camera/lens. But such fancy phones do have a tendency as one would say, fragile."
yes,yes,yes,I'm so in love with this phone is don't have words to explain it's just amazing
no,yes,yes,Battery life is very low and last about two hours max before you have to recharge. Phone comes with no way to insert another battery for backup. Also phone comes with no Sim card. The touchscreen is very unresponsive and very complicated to use and configure.
yes,yes,yes,"The camera is amazing, it is a real lightweight cellphone, the features are great. It over heats sometimes but besides that. I recommend it"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great. The champagne gold looks georgeous. Glad I upgraded!! The different features that it has for the phone are pretty awesome!
yes,yes,yes,"Long time iPhone user,recently change to galaxy s6"
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S6 is the Best Phone I ve had yet !! The Features Are something Else !!! Especially, Samsung being able to Remotely Connect to the S6 itself & fix Problems !!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I recently got a new galaxy s6, I can't describe the phone it's insanely incredible! I got the phone because of the camera...coming from a photographer I love it I take pictures like no other phone can and it's extremely quick. I love the new snapdragon processor!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. The display of the phone is gorgeous and the camera takes some excellent pictures. The touch ID is flawless and the phone runs very smooth all of the time.The battery could be better, but the quick charge and the wireless charging will correct that minimal set back.I am a long..."
yes,yes,yes,I always enjoy Samsung Galaxy products!!! My favorite.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone!! The picture quality is better than my camera and all my apps run smoothly. Easy to use, touch screen exceptionally accurate!"
no,yes,no,Every time I use the phone for over 10 minutes the phone starts to overheat for some reason it happens indoors and outdoors. It also had a delay when choosing applications. Can you help me with this problem.
yes,yes,yes,love the samsung products they are easy to use and easy to manouver
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great you can access so many things at one time it's good for work and home it give you so much access to the web and other great things I would recommend this to anyone and everyone it saves me a lot of time and makes everything difficult ,simple..."
no,no,no,"The S6 is not a bad phone, but not nearly the greatest either. My biggest problem is the battery life, it barely gets me through the workday. Granted I can charge the phone in less than a hour, but that is not the point.Also, it keeps switching back to the Samsung keyboard, even when I switch..."
yes,yes,yes,"The battery life needs improvement, but it is a good phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I was so excited to upgrade to this phone. On the outside, the phone is gorgeous. Then on top of that I outfitted the phone with the clear view samsung case. The combined package was a work of art, something to definitely stare at."
yes,yes,yes,"So first of all I do like the phone, It is slick, well made, and a power house with an octa-core processor. But I really miss my note 3. Samsung should have never made a iphone with android software."
no,no,no,"There are nothing but network and connectivity issues with this device. Whether on Wi-Fi or LTE, I get nothing but connectivity issues. Samsung needs to update this device with numerous bug fixes to resolve this issue. Battery life is not that bad. But the system itself is very laggy."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung took the Galaxy S series of phones to a new level with this current iteration. It's super fast and really functional. I consider myself a power user, so even my development projects are at peak performance when my GS6 is connected."
yes,yes,yes,"Devices have great cameras and super fast response, high screen display. The list goes on and but i have had with each phone small issues for function such as call gold transfer. Weird iss with lock screen while on a call not ending. Small things that why i stick with Samsung."
yes,yes,yes,This phone has some many features like mirroring on my TV. It will take to a long time to use on this phone new features.
yes,yes,yes,I am so glad I mad the Jump to Jump on Demand! The Galaxy S6 is a great phone and I love it.
yes,yes,yes,I personally love this phone to the max...it's my mini laptop I can do anything on it and still don't have to use a computer
yes,no,yes,This is the first time I am using a Samsung smartphone. I really like the features of this phone and the processor is very fast but the only issue i've noted is with the battery. The battery does not last very long.
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung S6! The quality of the camera is most amazing! I have been working on becoming a photographer and I can tell you from experience photos are just amazing!!
yes,yes,yes,I love all SAMSUNG PRODUCTS. it's so easy and cool with all there features. Trust me you will not disappointed with the S6
yes,yes,yes,This is still pretty new for me but so far I'm loving the phone...and love the wireless charging abilities as well! Can't wait to keep finding more and more ways to use this phone!
yes,no,yes,"I previously had an s3 and was missing out on all the cool tech. The S6 is porbably the fastest phone there is. The camera, colors and wireless charging are my favorite."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is pretty good. It has all the features I wanted in a phone, and for a reasonable price. The sound quality when calling is also excellent, much better than my old phone."
yes,yes,yes,I use it all the time on my smart tv and the wifi directs perfect
yes,yes,yes,A very fast and reliable personal mobile pc already!
yes,yes,yes,I have owned all for series of the Notes and decided to try something smaller with same features and have fell in love with my new S6. My camera on this phone is by far the best and the phone overall reminds me of an iPhone but 10xs better.
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone but sometimes it seems to have a mind of its own
yes,yes,yes,I had this phone for a long time and I really like it. The camera and display are outstanding. The only downside is phone feels slow sometimes may be because of the UI.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is beautiful. The screen is one of the best I've seen so far--everything comes out nice and crisp, and colors are very vivid. I've noticed minimal lag during my day usage, which is a huge plus."
no,no,no,"Not sure why, but it gets hot when used. Also, nor a fan of the camera which does not let the phone rest flat."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the galaxy s6, this cell phone device is the best device you can buy for a decent price and it comes with hundreds of cool and usefull new features i totally recommend it !!!"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has an amazing camera, fast processer, it's very durable, the picture quality compared to an iPhone just blows it out of the park!!"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great one of the best phones I have ever had, blazing fast processor , great quality pictures, great design oh did i mention the fingerprint feature has everything I ever wanted on a phone I would recommend this phone to anyone."
yes,no,yes,I love my galaxy 6 the only thing is if you forget to close all programs it will drain your battery fast. You can hook it up to the car aux or bluetooth anxd the music plays loud as you like and extra air like my LG. Wouldn't trade this for any iphone or brand..Make sure you get a case though.
no,no,no,The first phone I was given was defective...it would not fully charge and it would malfunction during calls...I was provided a new phone and this is working better...thx
yes,yes,yes,"After having the S3 for over two years, getting the S6 is an entirely different experience. I love using the SideSync app as it syncs better with my Mac than the Kies/S3 combination did. And I can't say enough about the camera features. Oh, and it happens to let you communicate well.."
yes,yes,yes,"Lightning-fast, brilliant HD screen, feature-rich! Now, if it would only accept my MicroHD card......"
yes,yes,yes,The one thing that I like about the phone is that it has a feature that allows me to keep track of my steps
yes,yes,yes,I got the Samsung instead of iPhone and I love it.
yes,yes,yes,S6 has a great feel about it. It is light weight and sleek. The screen color and resolution add to it.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought the Samsung Galaxy S6 32GB after thorough research on the different phones available today in the market. When I first started using it, I had certain doubts whether it was any different than my previous phone (Samsung Galaxy S5), and did notice some pleasant differences."
yes,yes,yes,I like the design its slim it feels premium in the hand. With 32 gb of base storage And great materials like the metal frame and glass which has no bends or creaks. I like the smoothness of the software had it for 3weeks no lag or crashes like in previous Samsung devices.
yes,no,yes,This is the most dependable phone I had so far I would recommend this to you
yes,yes,yes,Yes. I found that out within minutes of opening my new Galaxy S6. I love this phone! I don't think I've put it down since I got it.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is the perfect size for when I want to watch movies, videos and such. The Play Store also has the best apps to use when I'm bored. The camera as well is high quality, it had a variety of effects like cartoon, vintage, black and white and so on. There is a built in editor with the phone."
yes,yes,yes,This phone has the most elegant design in the market right now. Everything about this phone is just perfect
yes,yes,yes,"Just wanted to submit this review by honestly saying that this quite possibly the Best Smart Phone I ever used & have experienced. I work in IT so it is Paramount that I have a dependable, reliable and advanced Smart Phone that can handle my Multi-Tasking needs."
yes,yes,yes,I have had the privilege to have Android phones for over the past 6 years and I must say I am hooked. This new Samsung 6 is amazing. Everyday I am learning a brand new feature. I like Samsungs so much that both my parents own Samsung 6s. Keep up the great work in creating awesome devices.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been with tmobile for about two years now. I've had a couple of issues when I first started. But when I got an android galaxy s5, that was the most amazing thing. Now I've upgraded to the Galaxy s6 and this phone is fabulous. I love all the features, apps and etc."
yes,yes,yes,i have the gold S6 and love it!!! totally worth my money.screen is not too big but not too small. great speed and apps.speakers are great for my netflix addiction and pandora.
yes,yes,yes,The s6 is way better than the s4 in a couple of ways the battery is better the platform is easier ive only had one problem ive had to restart it a couple of times cause itll either get stuck with the screen dark or it will be slow so ill re boot it overall its an amazing phone
no,yes,yes,A big con on this phone is you NEED its exact charger to get a full battery. I read about the phone its suppose to be fully charged in 20 mins yet sometimes my phone says its going to take 5 hours !. I dont have manya apps at alll
yes,yes,yes,I love the galaxy S6 compared to the S5 because it runs smoother when I'm running a bunch of applications all at once.
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone. The camera on it is fantastic. I had been told it had a great camera on it. It really does. I like the size. It is slim. I like that Samsung has apps that they suggest for you to try. I don't always know what is available. I have found several apps that have been wonderful.
yes,yes,yes,Thid product truly exceeds my expectationd and I highly recommend it.
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone all but the battery. It seems to die way to fast, I am very active on my phone business and personal therefore I need great battery performance"
yes,yes,yes,99% satisfied could be waterproof but it's still satisfied.
yes,yes,yes,Me and my hubby love Samsung products. They have such a great reputation as far as being user friendly and I have heard the durability is extraordinary. I also have a Samsung cell phone. My family wants me to get them Samsung cell phones as well...You know I will..
yes,yes,yes,At first I really wanted the s6 edge but my S6 does everything I need it to do. I am a photographer and I shoot videos and a docu-series. My videos are almost as good of quality as my dslr! I've been a Galaxy Fan since the first Galaxy S.
yes,yes,yes,The phone has a great design but the battery life is not the best. I've had it for about a week and it is already freezing and force closing a lot of apps. Texting on the phone also lags a lot.
yes,yes,yes,The camera on this phone Is the best ever. I have bad nerves and I took wonderful pictures without and blurriness. I love it!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy s6 comes equipped with a 16 mega pixel camera which is way better than the 8 mega pixel camera that comes with the iphone. The display makes it look amazing too and the 4k video recording was amazing and captured my trip to hawaii perfectly.
yes,yes,yes,I heard so many people complain about the phone but honestly I don't see this.. The phone is amazing I love the battery life no problems so far.
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful sexy design. The gold color gives a classy metallic look. Phone is lightweight compared to others of its size. Fast processing speeds. Makes moving around the internet or checking emails like working on a computer. The screen is exceptionally bright. Has the fingerprint security feature.
no,no,yes,I'm Very Disappointed That The Samsung Galaxy S6 Don't Have The SIGNATURE On It. You Can't Manage Your Call If Your On Three Way If Someone Want To Get Off The Phone You Have To Hang Up On Everyone. The Battery Doesn't Last Long At All
no,yes,no,"admittedly I'm not cell phone proficient, it took me years to master touch keyboards and give up my old qwelty Stratosphere. but it was frustratingly slow online and battery got too hot to hold, so I moved up to the Galaxy 6."
yes,yes,yes,"I am loving my phone very much, awesome shape and size. design is slik and beautiful. glass body is fantastic. camera is awesome, overall its best phone so far. the one and only drawback i found so far is battery life."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is literally one of the best phones Samsung has build. The quality of this phone is out of this world. Literally my phone is way better than the cheap built quality of the Iphone's! But as the saying goes ""whoever laughs last, laughs the best!"" And that's what Samsung has done."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had a good experience with this phone so far. My only difficulty at this point is, as a first time user, a users manual that explains basic functions in a little more detail would be extremely helpful."
yes,yes,yes,good looking cell with a lot more useful app than iPhone
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone it had everything I need, and is customizable if you dint use an app get rid of it.This phone is worth the money."
yes,yes,yes,"I love everything about my S6 great pictures, battery life, amazing app"

yes,yes,yes,"the phone it self is good,, what i really dont care for is that is so fragil."
yes,yes,yes,I was able to control how healthy I was. It had a lot of features other phones don't have. I love the camera. It's quick and easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is great better then the s5 in all ways except the battery life is no good S5 I would say last longer so I would expect to have better if not the same battery life not less.
yes,yes,yes,This newest version lives up to expectations and is a great Samsung product. The screen is bright and takes excellent pictures with great clarity. It is easy to adapt to and transferring information was not difficult with an older Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,In short it's one of the best phones I've had in a while. I switched from an iPhone 5c to this phone and it's been an amazing change so far. I seriously recommend the phone.
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely love it!! Haven't had any problems with it like I have other phones. Holds the charge And is easy to use! It's not heavy or to big.
no,no,yes,I would have given it 5 all the way across the board except I do not like the speaker placement or the head phone jack.
yes,yes,yes,Going from the S4 to the s6 is a big difference! It's much faster and has such cooler features such as SOS feature and thumbprint unlock!
yes,yes,yes,"I had an iPhone 5 when I saw my campus Professor with this beautiful, sleek phone. I didn't want to interrupt the conversation; so I took the name Samsung and immediately researched this uniquely crafted device, and it's just the right size for me to handle and actually see what I'm looking at!."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone's camera function, takes the best pics out of all my group of friends, very high quality,"
yes,no,yes,"I like it, but the only thing that I don't like is the battery"
yes,yes,yes,After switching from my galaxy s 5 to the galaxy s 6. It was all well worth it. My galaxy s 5 phone had been stolen back in May and I was devastated. The 5 has some great features and I was in love with the phone.
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about the phone its design its display its functionality but I do miss the removable back if somehow you create a phone that has a removable back with the same design it would be great.
yes,yes,yes,"This is an excellent phone that I am very pleased with. The only feature that I have encountered so far that needs to be improved is the fingerprint sensor. Your finger has to be placed perfect for it to work correct every time.Also, the speaker is not the greatest."
yes,yes,yes,"I've used the Galaxy s4, Note 3, Note 4, Note 10.1, and the gear S watch. Out of all these devices the Galaxy S6 blows all of these devices out of the water. Beautiful display, amazing camera, & and the fastest device I've ever owned."
yes,yes,yes,OMG I totally love this phone it does everything I want and need it to do! Right size I love the color of it! Camara quality is great I would recommend this phone to anyone.
yes,yes,yes,"I decided to wait to upgrade my S4 until the S6 came out because the S5 didn't seem like a truly transformed design and thus worth the upgrade. Well, I'm glad I did because several of the features of the S6 have impressed me and most importantly, I can tell the difference in the phone's performance..."
yes,yes,yes,"This Samsung Galaxy S6 phone is the BEST! The battery takes a couple of charges to fully calibrate, but other than that (which is super minor) this phone is the perfect balance between practical and beautifully aesthetic. I am very happy with my purchase."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent display; very fast; strong WiFi and Cell connection; great software and apps; good tech support; in time software upgrade;
yes,yes,yes,I really like the gold face for the exterior. Feels and looks sleek. Most of all I love the themes option for your phone. Changes the interface to look like your receiving a new phone every time you change it! So much fun!
yes,yes,yes,It is by far the best phone I have had! Lots of great functions and works amazing with other Samsung products.
yes,yes,yes,"I was debating between the S6 and the Iphone 6, but I didn't like how the Iphone doesn't have the back button that I'm accustomed to. I'm glad I got the S6. It has great cameras, both front and back. My friends were really impressed when they took some selfies lol. It looks and feels nice."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing!! Samsung has truly outdo e themselves this time. I only use Samsung phones and this is by far my favorite!
yes,yes,yes,The speed and consistent performance is just outstanding. I can literally do anything where as when I'm on an actual computer I cannot. The wireless charge station feature is pretty rad too in my book. I'd most Def recommend this phone to anyone looking for a high performance piece of tech.
yes,yes,yes,The new camera is amazing. The processor is crazy fast. I love the look and feel of the new model.
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy my galaxy s6 best device on the market
yes,no,yes,it could be waterproof or water resistant that would make this phone incredible now if you guys came out with the Samsung 7 that was similar to the S six but was waterproof now that would be so much cool because everybody loves taking their phone everywhere and just the thought of getting it wet is...
yes,yes,yes,"Until now,I'm still learning how to handle this device both by myself,reading,advice,consulting customer sevrvice and bothering my daugter most of the time,I'm 65, you know I belong to another era,quite different to this one.This device is superb,amazing me all the time I'm very HAPPY let say SUPER..."
yes,yes,yes,"Great design, keys easy to use, sharp pictures, sharp colors, a pleasure to use and so much better than my old Galaxy S"
yes,yes,yes,This my second Galaxy. I also had the 4. I love the 6just like I loved the 4.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the camera on my galaxy 6 its quick and makes everything soo clear i love that you can also add themes to your phone instead of having to download it,its an awesome phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone , love everything about it... specialy the camera !!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone has great features and easy to use. I've had an iPhone for years and this phone was so easy to learn to use.
yes,yes,yes,The camera is what I like most...takes great pictures.
yes,no,yes,"It's fast, light and not bulky not my Note 3. The camera is outstanding to say the least and so are the features in the camera as well"
yes,yes,yes,I seriously love almost everything about this phone. The only negative thing I would say is that the battery life is not as good as other Samsung phones I have owned. Everything else is great
yes,yes,yes,With some good features and some not so good like battery performance..
yes,yes,yes,"The phone has great features but the service can sometimes get aggravating. I experience drop calls even with the data,everything else is unlimited but the data but I guess that's the catch to spend more money for upgrades."
yes,yes,yes,Glad I waited for this one! Camera is amazing which is super important for me as a first time mom. Screen is very responsive. I do use the Smart Lock with secure locations. I've set my home as a secure location but I still have to manually unlock it.
yes,yes,yes,"Compared to my former phone, this phone is 100x better. It performs very fast and has a very comfortable feel to it. Also, the pictures that the phone takes a ate ridiculously good. There's nothing I really dislike about the phone in all honesty."
yes,yes,yes,"I am still figuring out what features of the phone differ significantly from my S5. I love the camera, my pictures and video are amazingly clear. I still haven't mastered the split screen, but its definitely more seamless than on the S5."
yes,no,yes,"The phone works great for most of the things I use it for. Calling, texting, emailing, FB, etc.... however I do notice still a very minimal amount of lag from time time time. Like when I use the left recently used app key."
yes,yes,yes,"I had the Galaxy S3 and loved it but I love this phone even more. Between the gold color, the performance, and the better battery life, it's a great improvement over previous models."
no,yes,yes,"I love my phone and its design!! But I've only had it for right at 2 weeks and sometimes the functions just don't work. For instance, some of my apps will shut down and I have to reinstall them to work. Also, my fingerprint scanner has stopped responding TWICE in 2 WEEKS!!"
yes,yes,yes,The design of the s6 is so eligant. It feels great in your hands. There are also ago many great features that come along with the s6. It's very fast and efficient and the pictures come out beautifully.
yes,no,yes,I've owned the iphone 4 and even though I really did't have anything to complain about. I tried the galaxy s5 when I decided to upgrade. It was a bit annoying getting used to the new software at first but then I really found my new device very convenient with all the additional features.
yes,yes,yes,"I really love this phone, it has great features, the only thing I'm dissapointed with is that the hand gesture selfie camera doesn't really work that well, it never recognizes my hand. This camera takes awesome pictures with both the front and regular camera, awesome quality."
yes,yes,yes,"Loving having the Galaxy S6. The camera takes great photos, the Wifi calling option and download booster are nice features and screen resolution is amazing. only downside I've found is the battery life, however the quick charger helps me top off in a short time."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone so much. It does everything it says and more. The only problems I found is that when I leave the building of which I work, it has a problem with connecting back to my service. It may be a phone carrier problem. Also the RAM fills up way too fast which causes apps to crash."
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung S6 is a great phone....it's easy to use and the features are great. It simply works for me the way I need a phone to work and with 32G of storage I don't have a problem with space. My calls don't get dropped and people can hear me well, much better than the S5."
yes,yes,yes,"The new Samsung Galaxy 6, is a phone that transends past the modern technology of today and can be seen as a model for the future. With it's unique long lasting battery life the 6 will last for days without the use of a charger."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the design of the phone. The camara is really good. I just hate how it is really sensitive , my screan is always minimizing."
yes,no,yes,I love the fact that t-mobile stepped up to the plate and offer double the memory for the price of the lesser memory on Memorial day weekend. Also like the fact you can wirelessly charge the phone. Double the processors make this a lightning quick down and up loader.
yes,no,yes,"Perfect design, good battery, looks elegant"
yes,yes,yes,"Lightweight, durable phone with many great features."
yes,yes,yes,U can't go wrong if you want if or like technology to the fullest.their no better word .just go and check keep it out!
yes,yes,yes,After many weeks of using it this phone is just flawless. It makes the competition look like a thing of the past.
no,yes,yes,"Before i had the galaxy 5s, i love samsung products my only problem with the 6s is that is too slow. If im gonna send an email or txt it takes some time to open the application. Not sure if my phone have an issue but this is my experience."
yes,yes,yes,This is my first Android phone and after many reviews of other droids out there this surpasses any other design out there to include the Samsung Galaxy 5. What attracted me to the phone first was the 16MP camera and front and back feature camera like an Iphone.
yes,yes,yes,"I had the S4, S5 and continue to upgrade to S6. I love it!!!!! I could switch among phones very smooth with Smart Switch, I have all my data, it was fast. Very bright colors. Easy to use. I love it!!!!!!!....Very elegant."
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I have ever had and hands down the best galaxy yet
yes,yes,yes,It is really easy to use. I like how much you can personalize it. The only thing I did not like was that some apps that come with the phone cannot be removed.
yes,yes,yes,I love the Gold Platinum color. Battery last long and recharge very fast. I like the video performance while playing movies. Sound output is awesome!
yes,yes,yes,"Phone looks good. Most people like the size, I just prefer a smaller phone. Camera is nice. Still need to use the video in a concert. It feelso sturdy. I'm happy work my purchase."
yes,yes,yes,"Overall I am happy with the phone. Meeting the needs for my personal and business needs. The previous phone I had prior to this one was not working out for me with just 1 week of use. Since switching to S6, I am pleased"
no,yes,yes,I have had to replace my phone twice and I have to do it again within 3 days this ducks plus I lost my data and the oil store is the one th as the transfered .you stuff on top of that the see day I not a tablet and am iPhone 6 really this shouldn't happen
yes,yes,yes,I've been a loyal Galaxy S phone user for many years and I loved that fact that we had freedom to add memory via memory cards or carry that spare battery. That's what made us Galaxy users love it so much. Now with this S6....you just jumped into the pool with iPhone.
yes,yes,yes,"At first it took me a while to figure out everything new with it. I am a little disappointed that it doesn't have the air gesture anymore (or I don't know how to set it up), and I don't like how there are less settings for the phone like the Samsung 4."
yes,yes,yes,"I really like my new Samsung Galaxy S6. I like the upgrades. The things I would change are: my instructions on operations of phone, be able to put pictures with contacts while saving it on the sim card, the phone it self should come in more colors other then black,white,gold maybe add blue, yellow,..."
yes,no,yes,I really like the way you are able to respond to messaged with out leaving the application you are currently using.
yes,yes,yes,"Without getting all spiritual, this phone is a gift from the gods. Ive had this phone for about a week now and everyday I am finding out new features. The design is amazing the look sexy and the upgrades are phenomenal. This phone is something to brag about. Great job"
yes,yes,yes,"it's the lightest phone I've ever had. also very thin the nicest design i've seen, other than the iphone."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone! A little pricey but what phone isn't these days. Overall amazing phone.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I've purchased from Samsung ever! Looks nice great sound quality and the best pictures I've every seen on a phone. This phone is everything and more. I had to get my niece one too
yes,yes,yes,"I love the design in this phone, the features in it are wonderful also..."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is wonderful and Touch Wiz has really improved since the last Samsung phone I had (S4). The screen is a great size and the clarity is very nice. The only downfall I have noticed is the battery life. It's pretty terrible.
yes,yes,yes,Great size great features great phone would tell everybody to get phone
yes,yes,yes,"Many years of going thru all sorts of phones. From Samsung, apple to zte and alcatel. Until I got my first gallaxy s3, s5 now this bad boy of course. Takes some time to get used to if your used to lollipop or lower. Fast, lookout has retrieved my phone 2 times. New features that are very impressing."
yes,yes,yes,This is a wonderful phone ! So glad I upgraded to this phone! Never going back to the iPhone
yes,yes,yes,"I am completely in love with my new phone. I previously purchased the white, but then learned the gold color had arrived at my local store and decided to exchange for the gold because I've had a white Samsung S4, previous to owning the S6."
yes,yes,yes,Awesome phone. The phone is fast and easy to use. Battery life isn't the best but with fast charge so long as you got a few minutes to charge then you are good. Fingerprint scanner is effective. Beautiful screen display and just overall a great phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I've been a long time Samsung addict. When I shop I always look for the Samsung name first. Technology wise Samsung is hard to beat. Not much more can be said, ""Just simply love it."
no,yes,yes,"So it's a good phone. My huge issue with it is that there is no mobile data toggle in the drop down notification panel. This is a huge design flaw that annoys customers because instead of having the easy ability to turn data on and off, I now have to go through the entire menu to turn it on/off."
yes,yes,yes,"I can say with the short time I've had my s6 edge I've enjoyed the features built into this phone. I must say there are a few things I still don't know what can or can not be done. Heck I felt the same way with my s4. After some time of watching videos and asking other users, I got a hang of it."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the smoothness of how I can swipe through the screens. Samsung really did a good job of streamlining touchwiz. It is so convenient that the camera pops up as quickly as it does, so I don't miss the moment."
yes,yes,yes,"I truly liked the S5 the best of all. The new s6 is not any faster. The slick case makes the phone slip from my hand easier. The battery life was better on the 5. I miss the removable battery,and sd card."
yes,yes,yes,I purchased a galaxy s3 not even a year ago and was much pleased with it so when I herd about the s6 I went straight to it with out going through the other models very much pleased with my purchase
yes,yes,yes,"This product has a lot of features that are really neat and to know that your phone can do all these things! Makes it easy for me to not only use, since I most definitely have difficulties with technology, but to find my apps and anything I need!"
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is very good and reliable, my only issue is that it will not connect with Samsung Smart Switch on your PC.To me thats not good, Samsung's 2016 Flagship phone not be able to connect to an important Samsung product that is used to back up and or update your phone"
yes,yes,yes,I only wish I could use a micro SD card in it. The tech support staff is second to none also.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone itself. My friend and I both got the same phone a few days apart and are having the same issues. Ever so often it'll get glitchy and restart itself. Hers tends to overheat. Overall I like the phone, the look of it and features. The glitches tend to correct their self."
yes,yes,yes,I've had the phone for around a year and the camera makes noises i believe its the image stabilizor. I have also never got a update for the phone. But its looks great and the camera still takes great photos.
yes,yes,yes,I am still a new user and learning to do things on this Samsung s6. BUT now I discover that I can not receive multi media messages because APN options are missing from this phone!
yes,no,yes,This phone is very responsive and fast. The touch screen works flawless.
yes,yes,yes,It has not been a good experience. The ram is always
yes,yes,yes,I am enjoying the new phone but need to learn more about the new features.
yes,yes,yes,Always the best for me.
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from my Samsung Galaxy because it was very outdated & slowed to a snails pace. My techy grandson helped me pick the S6 out telling it was perfect for my needs. I wanted another Samsung because I was very happy with them in the past. Just perfect, bigger than what I had but not too big."
no,yes,yes,"Love the phone and features, but the screen is a joke. Had a small drop and the screen cracked in several spots."
yes,yes,yes,I had a Galaxy Core Prime and find the S6 to be an awesome upgrade. It is well built and performs much better than the Core Prime.
yes,yes,yes,"Before this phone I had a galaxy grand prime, and let me tell you this is really an upgrade in every way. I'm in love with this phone."
yes,yes,yes,"It has been a great phone, it's been a wonderful product and wished that I would have bought one earlier."
yes,yes,yes,"I love Samsung phones. The past 4 phones I've had were samsung. I had a Samsung flip phone, Samsung Galaxy s3, Galaxy s4, and the Galaxy S6. I have loved everyone of them and was satisfied everytime."
yes,yes,yes,For the price of my new Galaxy S6 I am very pleased. The camera is top notch with great resolution and awesome features including slow motion video. All of my call have had great clarity and it has got service in places previous phones havent.
yes,yes,yes,It's an amazing phone only it's a little slippy cuz the back is glass
no,yes,yes,"Phone is easy to use. But now that I have this phone, i have lots of dropped calls, calls that don't come thru, and I'm not able to talk and be on Internet at the same time. My previous phone had no issues and I still have same service provider. Very frustrating ."
yes,no,yes,"I got a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 several years ago and loved it. I'm still using it and it's still going strong. I've also been with Tracfone since 2002, so when I needed a new phone and checked the Tracfone site and saw they offered the Samsung Galaxy S6 & S7 phones, I had to go for it."
yes,yes,yes,"Nice phone. I had a LG Ultimate 2 before this. The difference between the two is like night and day. My older daughter has a Galaxy s6 through a contract carrier, and she was surprised that Tracfone had them available, but she is locked into a 2 year contract."
yes,yes,yes,I haven't had one tiny problem. The camera is the best so far. The apps run really fast. The picture is unreal.
yes,yes,yes,"I have only had this phone for 5 days and I love it so far. Although I haven't discovered all it can do yet, I am impressed with what I have figured out already. I'm sure that if the signal where I'm at now was better the performance rating would be 5*. I love it so far"
yes,yes,yes,It has thumb print access. It charges quicker and my access to view videos load faster. Now my kids want to get this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Just bought this beautiful new phone. The transfer of info from my S3 to this S6 took about 5 seconds! Amazing how simple they synced by holding back to back. Love it!
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone a lot but the only think I dislike about this version is that it is locked to 5.0.2 lollipop. You can not update it but all the other features make up for it. And you also can do Samsung pay just so you know.
yes,yes,yes,I have had my Galaxy S6 for two weeks now. It has a beautiful clear display. I'm learning new tips and tricks every day. But what I love most is the awesome pictures it takes.
yes,yes,yes,"I like the ease of use,. I love Samsung and recommend them to my friends"
no,yes,no,"Good phone for about a month. After that it was extremely slow and buggy. Every single time I would clean my phone and factory reset it, it would be good for a short while, but crash after. Great look and camera, just wish it would have all around been a good purchase."
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung S6 has been great! I love the fast charging comma and the quick download. So far I take Samsung products over any other products due to reliability and durability. I am appreciative that I have upgraded to the S6!!!
yes,yes,yes,Great phone goes above and beyond what i need it to do. The phone has no glitches and functions great even when the battery gets low.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had a few Samsung phones before and each one was better than the last. The Galaxy S6 is a great phone. I like the fact that it is a sealed phone. Other phones I've had in the past, the back would come loose after and keep falling off after extended use."
yes,yes,yes,I read up on cellphones before I bought my first on. The Samsung Galaxy S6 was the right one for me and my price range. I love the 4k display! It is perfect for enjoying all of my video streaming services.
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about it. I will recommend it to my friends and family. Great job Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,It is easy to navigate thru the screens and prompts.
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung Galaxy S6 the best phone I've ever had in my lifetime how to recommend it to anyone who's looking for a new phone have recommended it to other people
yes,yes,yes,I used to have an iPhone and I thought it was so amazing but then I kept developing a bunch of problems and at the time I had a friend who had purchased a s6 and he kept showing me all the things it could do. So I eventually purchased one and I love it.
no,no,no,"The camera on my phone doesn't work, I don't have an SD card in it like all the fixes for the problem says to pull out the SD card and then it will work. I don't have onenough in this phone yet and I'm still having problems."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone it's got a couple thing I don't like but no all is perfect but great performance really good camera an good design if I could add and take away a few things to this phone buy knowing what I know an what I hear I think I could make close to the perfect cell phone
yes,yes,yes,LOVE the phone and having ability to use through tracfone! Only wish it had been with more memory options for phone to accommodate picture storage.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Galaxy s6, the size is perfect, all of the new features are amazing, it's fast, the camera is amazing, picture quality is amazing, the colors in the display are great. I don't have a bad thing to say about this phone."
yes,yes,yes,First impression was the sleek design and all metal case. Very high tech and high end looking. Touch Wizard performs smoothly. All settings are intuitive and easy to find. Performance is very fast thanks to 3 gigs of RAM. Love this phone!
yes,yes,yes,"Would definitely recommend it too anyone! Awesome phone, feastures, performace, and design. But I do wish it would update tho. It says update service temporarily unavailable."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is Great and easy to use I had another name brand smart phone and I like this one a lot better. I would recommend this phone to anyone.
yes,yes,yes,I have only had this phone for 2-3 wks but I love it so far. I upgraded from a Moto E which I didn't like at all.
yes,yes,yes,The S6 is nice and slick. Has good features and works very smoothly. But switching to an internal/unremovable battery was a bad idea.
yes,yes,yes,I have had my s6 for a few months now and I'm still finding new and useful features all the time. The finger print scan is more useful than I can say and the fact that you can use multiple fingers at different angles makes it easy to unlock your phone however you my be holding it.
yes,yes,yes,This phone does everything that I could possibly want.
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had my Galaxy S6 for a couple of weeks, but so far I'm very happy with its performance. I was on the fence about getting it after reading some negative reviews, but I'm glad I ignored them. I love the features on this phone. It's completely what I wanted and expected."
yes,yes,yes,This phone has enough space on it to have more than just songs or a few apps. It actually fits in my pocket and seems durable.
yes,yes,yes,I love the weight of this phone. It feels great in my hand! It is also incredibly fast!
yes,yes,yes,Everything workshould well out here in the boonies. Seems I have to charge it more often now though.
yes,yes,yes,"Fast,nice style, and great features..............."
yes,yes,yes,Would recommend to anyone. Easy to use and has many great features.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is just the right size, it has a good size screen yet isn't like carrying a tablet around"
yes,no,yes,Upgraded from the s5 to s6. It's faster but I don't like the fact that there isn't a SD card for it.
yes,yes,yes,It is a great phone and every way to me especially the speed of it. The only thing I don't like is that the phone system take up a whole about 6 gb which leaves around 25 gb. I didn't know it took up that much room. I couldn't transfer all my stuff from my old phone.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone i ever owned. And I do not have a phone service like version or att i got straight talk. So I paid for it. And it was will worth it. Best phone i ever owned. And thinking of buy one for my wife. Plus going to buy your tablets. For both of us. Cannot say enough about your products.
yes,yes,yes,Phone works great. Charges very fast. And love the features that it came with it.
yes,no,yes,"I have owned this phone a little over one month now, and it is several heads and shoulders above the awful Galaxy Centura phone I owned while making my way through college. I probably haven't even discovered all of the potential apps and features that will make this phone even more awesome, but that..."
yes,yes,yes,I was very weary about giving up my s4. Then I got the s6 and I am in love. To me it is so much easier to use. The only down side is not being able to take out the battery myself.
yes,yes,yes,Why won't my Galaxy S6 I realize that there are many functions that are very useful I am very impressed with the Galaxy S6 and as for any other new products that come out I am looking forward to trying them.
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy having my new s6. I upgraded from the s3 and enjoy how much faster it is. It was a bit expensive for the phone since I bought it outright but I am glad I got it. I really enjoy playing with the s health app and tracking my walking during the day.
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone but it also has its down sides too. Overall good phone
yes,yes,yes,The S6 is so much better than its predecessors. Total must have.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is by far one of the best phones over ever had! I love the design and all the things you can do with it. Definitely worth the buy!! Thanks Samsung!!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,"Love my new gs6..... great speed, easy to use, and tons of amazing apps and features! Only drawback is the price tag, but if you want a great phone pony up the cash and enjoy!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is the greatest phone yet. It's very fast and never goes slow. I never have drop calls. My reception is always excellent. I would recommend this to anyone. I know they would be satisfied. I love my phone.
yes,yes,yes,Great camera! Love the features on this phone! It's not to big and very easy to use
yes,yes,yes,♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡♡I love my new phone.I had always wanted a Samsung Galaxy and not I have one I love the way the pictures look on it and not only that but I love the way it fits In my hand and is the same size from my ear to my mouth I actually feelike like people can here me on the phone...
yes,yes,yes,"It's an amazing phone, I absolutely love it. It has great features and runs at tops speed."
yes,yes,yes,And done are not in just wish I could have gotten the Samsung but the only way that could of happened was I'd I either waited for 8 months or switched to a major carrier which I'm not a rich man so I went worth this step down. But I know I'll enjoy this newer phone
yes,yes,yes,Easy to use. Much faster and great design. Much more free space for apps and data. Best phone by far!
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone buy now. It makes calls and has pong and floppy bird flaps on it if you like.
yes,yes,yes,Only thing I would change is faster android updates.
yes,yes,yes,Fingerprint scanner isn't the greatest. It has no removable battery or SD card slot so space is limited and no possibility of getting an extended battery to prolong use for those of us that work jobs with no possibility of being able to charge when needed. It is great size works fast.
yes,yes,yes,I love my new galaxy s6 ive had every galaxy phone since the s3 i love the new design and the camera is excellent and streaming videos the screen has greag picture only part i dont like is it doesnt have extra storage but thats not a huge problem i love the new back on the phone much better than the...
yes,yes,yes,This product had more features than I could have imagined! Still new to it but loving it so far!
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely love the Samsung Galaxy s6,would highly recommend to anyone it's such a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,With the world's technology racing at the speed of sound it is awesome for a company to listen to its customers. Samsung has exceed the expectations beyond limits. Samsung Galaxy 6s is the best phone I have ever owned. Surpassing windows in every way this phone caters to my every need.
yes,yes,yes,"Easy to use, great display in sunlight, wish it had expandable memory"
yes,no,yes,"I would prefer this over the edge. It runs so fast, its waterproof to an extent, and the battery life is unbelieveable. Would recommend to a stranger. It is just that amazing"
yes,yes,yes,I just got my Galaxy S6 and I love it. I went straight from a 3 to a six so it took some time to get use to but I love it. I like the camera it has way better quality then the 3. I have played with the S5 and I am so glad I got the S6.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is exactly what I was lookin for its big but not too big I can go between Web pages with ease it's battery lasts me all day I love it
yes,yes,yes,I have had this phone 2 weeks and like it very much. Would recommend it to anyone
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I ever bought. Love it I'd recommend it to everyone
yes,yes,yes,"since I've got this phone I am very pleased on the quality and how it takes pictures, they come out so clear, it's not to big, perfect size. I have got so many compliments on it."
yes,no,yes,"I definitely underestimated the Samsung Galaxy S6. I thought it didnt have that many features. Now i see that its camera, UHD video recording, high speed when browsing the web is definitely better than the iPhone 6S which I had. Definitely sticking to Samsung from now on."
yes,yes,yes,I love the galaxy line and I definitely not disappointed in the s6.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It took a little while to get use to it. I had a S4 before this and its completely different. Its different that you cant get to the battery its a solid piece.
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I have ever received! I don't know what I would do without this phone!
yes,yes,yes,"Altogether, I like this phone. It just misses the key features of a SD-Card slot and exchanging the battery."
no,yes,yes,The phone was a great phone but it is not durable and it dont last long. Once you drop the phone it no longer work.
yes,yes,yes,This is my third smartphone and is the best of all by far. I love the camera resolution and the battery life is awesome. I could never finish the day on one charge with its predecessors and this one drops 20 percent a day. I am running 6.0.1.
yes,yes,yes,I really like the phone but the only thing that i don't like is it has battery issues and i thought the galaxy S6 got android os 6.0 and up not android os 5.1.1 but i really do like this phone i will deftinly recomend this phone to anyone.
yes,yes,yes,"Had an S3 for years, suddenly it went down, needed a new phone and now am so happy with my S6. Great features, easy to use and a super camera. Highly recommended."
no,yes,no,"I switched to the Samsung Galaxy s6 from an iPhone and I absolutely hate it! The storage sucks, the phone is super slow and what makes the phone suck so bad is that it IS ALWAYS overheating!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone, the look, the system, and performance!! I just wish we could have emojis in our contacts names and that it is easier to hang up on one call and switch to another without hanging up either."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my 3rd Samsung Galaxy Phone, and I also own a galaxy tablet. Love them! Never have an issue."
yes,yes,yes,0verall pretty good. I expected the camera to be betting in low light. Fingerprint reader only works less than half of the time.
yes,yes,yes,I had to get this unlocked without all the bloat wear from cellphone companies. I love it but I wish they would have had expandable memory. No SD card slot. I love it even though the small problems.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is perfect size. It has top noch technology and the internal battery is a nice feature even though I was skeptical. I've never had issues. It charge however last longer than the 4 and 5 still needs charged throughout the day. It charges fast in about 10mins.
yes,yes,yes,I love the freedom of file-transfers between Samsung Phones and other devices. The only thing I wanted more is an addition of a Micro SD Card slot wherever possible. I will choose this one or S7 over iPhone 7S Plus.

no,yes,yes,"Many of you will most likely be as blown away by this as I was, but here it goes. I was on my grandpa's boat Saturday, my S6 is in my shorts pocket with an inexpensive case on it (all ports exposed). Long story short...I end up falling off the back of the boat into the river."

no,no,no,Too Bad ITS not water resistant. Should be metre than the s5
yes,yes,yes,"It took me some time to get used to getting things set up. It's different from the S5 that I had. But it's speed is amazing, with a 64 bit architecture. The only disappointing thing I found is that you cannot add a SD card for extra storage."
yes,yes,yes,After the software update to marshmallow I am still loving my Galaxy s6 .it is smarter than me and I'm learning new things everyday on it.
yes,no,yes,I have been having this phone for a few months now and I love it. The performance is good and the battery last. The only issue that I have now is that my camera is not working properly.

This phone is very fast on making those calls.It also takes very clear pictures, even in low light.I was previously using a Galaxy SIII and used Samgung Smart Switch..."
yes,yes,yes,Man if you want a phone that does it all pick this up right now. Samsung pay the features all the sensors it has it's no wonder why there on top of the game. I would prefer a Gs6 over a Gs7 just because of the IR blaster and because it has the beautiful 16 mp camera.

yes,yes,yes,The unlocked S6 works perfect. Okay the battery isn't removable and it doesn't have the SD card slot. But this battery lasts much longer than phones built specifically for networks that have pre-loaded bloatware. The phone never locks up and the battery never drains as a result.
yes,yes,yes,"So far, the phone is really good. The reception is great, I can hear clearly when I'm talking to other person through the phone, and so can they. That is the main reason of the phone. The second great feature is multitasking. It works flawlessly."

yes,yes,yes,"Like this phone, nice size, very clear, takes great photos."

yes,yes,yes,"Performance is awesome, screen is good looking, camera is awesome! But there is one thing that I hate about it, and that is the battery life. On screen time is scraping 3 hours to 4 hours tops, and the auto focus for some reason is a bit odd, it always looks for focus and I've missed some shots with..."
yes,yes,yes,"Started using this phone and the experience is really good considering android OS.1) No LAGHaving said the above good features, the one that disappoints is battery efficiency. It drains out quickly. If this gets fixed in Android Marsh Mallow, then it can easily beat the google products."
yes,yes,yes,Screen is great. Camera is superb. Battery is mediocre. Design is a big upgrade from Galaxy S5. Fingerprint scanner is okay. Overall best smartphone!
yes,yes,yes,EVERYTHING IS AWESOME. just not the battery life but overall it's good
yes,yes,yes,"My first smartphone. After making many comparisons, I chose this phone. I know I will not be one to look to always look for the newest phone; so I expect this to last me at least 4 years. I have only had it a few weeks and went to a workshop. I feel very confident that I made the right choice."
yes,yes,yes,"After about 2 years with the iPhone is decided to properly give android a shot, wasn't disappointed! The phone is very powerful and fairly easy to use. I love the widgets, and the ability to install plug-ins! Overall it was a very smooth transition,with no regrets."
yes,yes,yes,"I have always had Samsung phones even my first flip phone was samsung. The s6 is my favorite by far, I had the note 4 and did love it but I didn't really use all of the options on it so I went to the s6. This phone is perfect it does what I want it I have had no issues with it at all."

no,yes,yes,"I am very satisfied with this phone. My only complaint is how fragile it is. Mine fell of from just one feet high and I ended up with a shattered screen.

yes,no,yes,I haven't had any issue with the phone so far as far as how it works. There are a few things I don't like which is are the non removable battery. I prefer to be able to replace the battery or remove it if need be. The 2nd thing is the non expandable memory.

yes,no,yes,I just wanna say that I own pretty much all Samsung products in my house. The phone has been one of my products for more than 6 yrs now. And this new Samsung Galaxy 6s is awesome. Couldn't have been more happier to have received it. I can only imagine having the tablet to go with it.
yes,yes,yes,I haven't had a new phone for a long time and when I looked at this phone I told myself I will give it a try to see if I can get one. When they told me I was approved for one it surprise me since then I love my phone and hope in a couple of months I will be able to get the Galaxy S7

yes,yes,yes,I love the camera on this phone. I take some great photos and I can edit them on the fly.It moves smoothly from one app to the next. I've downloaded a lot of apps and I use them all the time.
yes,yes,yes,Love the galaxy! After the 1st one I knew I'd never go back to any other phone
no,yes,yes,The homepage carousel feature doesn't loop. I don't know why they would take this feature out!
yes,yes,yes,"Using a tablet, has made my transition from a flip-phone to this, very easy. Sure do love my new phone. Great gift from my boyfriend for Christmas!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I use a lot of Samsung products and I also carry an Note 5. The size on the note is excellent, but I received a S6 for my business line and the size of it is really the winner for me. The software is fast and crisp as well allowing me to zoom through everything I need for productivity. Great device"
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about this phone. The features are great and easy for a cell phone notice like me.
yes,no,yes,The S6 is better than the S5 with camera quality and speaker quality. I'm glad to see Samsung is still improving.

yes,yes,yes,It works great. The camera is very nice. Takes a really nice picture.
yes,yes,yes,"I'm in love with my new phone. With the exception of a few annoying apps I'll never use, it's a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,I'm not good with technology at all but this phone is really easy to use! It's not hard to figure out at all. I was able to put new apps on it & figure out what was already on it pretty quickly.
yes,yes,yes,I'm very pleased with my new phone. Performance is great. The battery life is very important to me and I give it a 5 for excellent.
yes,yes,yes,I love my galaxy s6.. Its fast.. No problems at all.. Love the features....I recommend it to everyone...

yes,yes,yes,This phone is a great choice. Has nice features and easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my Samsung 6. I am very pleased with the simplicity of the featured apps, design of the phone and ease of use. There are still some features I am discovering on the phone, and enjoy the ones I have mastered."
yes,yes,yes,Loving my new phone. Faster than last phone and doesn't freeze up like old one did. Like how a tab comes down from the top when I have a phone call instead of taking over entire screen when I'm already doing something on phone. Screen very responsive. Love the wireless charging option.
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from an S4 to the S6. Other than it being so thin and slick (thus easy to drop), it's awesome. Love the camera as it allows me to capture my 3 kids any time and it's clear!"
yes,yes,yes,The upgraded battery life has really freed me from the charging cord that I would have at all times with my previous phone. The speed with which the phone completes operations and the multitasking opportunities are a huge plus also.
yes,yes,yes,As a previous S5 owner I don't see enough changes or upgrades to justify getting a new phone. On the plus side it does seem to be a bit quicker performance wise and a better camera also.
yes,yes,yes,I love how clear images are on this phone.
no,yes,yes,"Love phone, but have problem with internet. Someone told me internal antennae might be faulty."
yes,no,yes,I transitioned from a galaxy s4 to the s6 with no problems. Much faster processor and better quality picture taken with camera.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my phone however, there are 2 things I feel would improve this product. 1. Allow users the opportunity to insert a SD card. 2. Allow users to swipe and open aps from the initial screen."
yes,yes,yes,"I have had many phones,Samsung by far has the best features,apps,and the phone quality I have become a costume to. I had an iPhone but have switched to samsung,and will not be returning!"
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from the s4 to the s6 and it is even better yet. The features are awesome and the phone speed and usability is great! Highly recommend!
yes,no,yes,Easy for me to see. I like the finger print lock. Just the right size for my needs.
yes,yes,yes,I have had this S6 for about 1 month. I like the overall looks and feel of the phone. It is the right size and has a very clear screen. I miss some of the features that my S3 & S4 had but overall I like the phone. It does what I want it to do.
yes,yes,yes,"Easy to use,it even connects with my new camera ,best phone for connecting to kodak picture machine in stores"
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from the Galaxy S III. I didn't want, and didn't need any of the more advanced smartphones. I use my phone primarily as a phone, for social media, for email,some banking and, of course, pictures. This phone is perfect for me."
yes,no,yes,"I have always enjoyed Samsung products. After having one of the Note series phones, the Galaxy 6 doesn't seem to be a good comaprison. I will probably get a Note at my next upgrade."
yes,yes,yes,Don't like that the 5 was water proof but then the six isn't? Why change a good feature? Do like that it seems a little more rugged. I've dropped it 5 or 6 times and no cracked screen.
yes,yes,yes,I love the new feature of the phone. Its totally amazing and technology revolutionized. I was ios user but that became boring after years of no improvements. The samsung phone with the andriod os is a perfect revolution of the new world of technology and communication.
yes,yes,yes,"Love it so much! Really easy to use, clear display, convenient."
yes,yes,yes,I would say this is a very beautiful phone and has great specs and performance. The only problem is that the battery life is terrible
yes,yes,yes,"I have always been a fan of Samsung. The quality of their products and design of them are always amazing. They have stood behind their products and services for as long as I have been a customer. I will continue to be a loyal customer as well, keep up the great service Samsung, thank you!"
yes,yes,yes,Love my S6. Upgraded from the 4 and it is faster and more fun.
yes,yes,yes,"Changed from S5 to the new S6. Lightning fast phone, better designed. Well done!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone, so many great features such as s health app and a perfect camera!"
yes,yes,yes,Overall a great phone just wish battery life was a little better.
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded my device from an S3 to the S6. Biggest improvement is the battery life. I didn't give it 5 stars for features as the fingerprint scan only works about 25 percent of the time. I think it has to do with the design of the button as I have an iPad which works fine.
no,yes,yes,This product is super fast and I even have really slow wifi
yes,yes,yes,"The S6 has a very quick processing speed. The speed is a major leap up from the S3. The finger print lock also works marvelously, much better than the S5. The camera is great as well. So far I love my new phone!"
yes,yes,yes,"I had spent about a year with the Galaxy S4, and loved it every minute. When the S6 launched, I knew I had to upgrade. I was immediately satisfied and still love using it. The battery life is great, and even when it runs low, the Ultra Power Saving mode is a literal and figurative 'live-saver'."
yes,yes,yes,"I have been an iPhone user since day one. I currently own an iPhone 4 & was looking to make the jump to andriod. I thought to my self, what better time then now? With the new s6 and it's amazing graphics, camera & heart beat monitor it is pushing the limits to what a current phone is."
yes,yes,yes,I love the camera on this product. Takes nice pictures. The speed of the phone is great too.
yes,no,yes,"With the Galaxy S6, what you're getting is a premium phone for a premium price. It's not cheap, but you get what you pay for. Best screen, quickest processor, and an amazing camera, plus a nice set of additional features, such as fast charging, wireless charging, ultra power saver, a fingerprint..."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone but miss some of the older features phones use to have like creating a signature for text messaging & tip calculators. Took me awhile to figure out how to delete messages & emails. A little more challenging to close Internet & apps.
yes,yes,yes,"This is my 3rd Samsung, it keeps getting better. S6 is very smooth. Awesome camera. Couldn't be happier!"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is my life line. High performance is the key for me.
yes,yes,yes,"Hands down, a big winner. My ""i"" friends are jealous..... love the look, size and features. Camera is fabulous too!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"I like the phone, I do miss the option where you double hit the home button to do a voice thing to search. Useful when traveling. Otherwise, its not over the top since it been pretty similar from my S4."
yes,yes,yes,I keep finding more great features on my Galaxy S6. I needed a good fast acting camera and it works great. I don't use my computer much anymore because my smartphone is just as fast.
yes,yes,yes,the battery life is so much better than my samsung s4
yes,yes,yes,They really paid attention to the details with this one. Great lines. Fabulous design. And all the features you come to expect from Samsung. Great phone. And I love that you can uninstall the apps you don't use that are preloaded. Thanks Samsung!
yes,yes,yes,Geezer friendly says it all.
yes,yes,yes,"I've had the phone for over 2 weeks now. So far I love it! The camera is amazing! Love the quality of it and the zoom is great, just used it at a wwe event. Took great pics. The large screen is a must feature for me. The software is awesome, easy for me to use."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new S6.... it is easy to use and fast!! The photos are crisp and perfect!! ;-)
yes,yes,yes,"I love the s6, very fast, takes great pic! And the selfie camera is great! The phone is very well built!"
yes,no,yes,"I love my Galaxy S6 very much, but the battery life has gotten worse sense I got it."
yes,yes,yes,"I love Samsung. I've had quite a few Samsung products. Including tablets, appliances, and phones. The s6 doesn't hold a charge as well as I'do like for it too. But, other than that it's pretty solid so far!"
yes,yes,yes,It's perfect all together I wouldn't choose any other maker other than samsung
no,yes,yes,This is the second Samsung Galaxy s6 I tried. Neither had a battery that would last all day. Very disappointed. I'll stick with iPhones!!
yes,yes,yes,I am a second family generation of users that prefer Samsung Electronics. Never have I ever had to use a warranty. My Samsung Gamer TV is going on 15 years old and never had an issue. Phones are always first choice as well.
yes,yes,yes,Love my Samsung s6 make my life so good
yes,yes,yes,very sleek fast and nice I love how the phone fits and the snapdragon processor woa watch out. Anyway awsome it gets the job done
yes,no,yes,only request I would ask for is waterproof which the newer phones actually have.
yes,yes,yes,"This is really a great phone- its quick and light, and has tons of features. Not so happy about the lack of a battery swap option, sometimes the quick charge isnt enough, and the lack of expandable storage options is a little disappointing over our last S5 & S5 models.Would like to see at least an..."
yes,yes,yes,I've had my phone since July of 2014 and I haven't had any problems what so ever i've gone from LG to Iphone and finally found this phone and I fall in love with it more and more everyday. I would recommend and do recommend this phone to everyone.
yes,yes,yes,"Granted I've had a lifeproof case on this phone since I've got it, this phone has treated me very well. It has a sleek design and the phone rarely gets hot. I do a lot of gaming and use it on a sales based job."
no,no,yes,I have had this phone for a year and the screen is all ready falling apart. I have not done anything to it. I ask the people to fix it and they said no. Dont get it but get it if you dont find the screen falling apart.
yes,yes,yes,"I like the phone even though it took me almost a year for somebody to just happen to help me figure out how to use most of the functions sense the phone don't tell you. The one thing I do really HATE about the phone though, other than not coming with instructions telling you about all features and..."
no,yes,yes,So I loved my S4 and S5 then I went on to the S6. For the first month it was steady and decent then my battery life went off a cliff. 4 hours of battery life while barely using any apps? Completely unacceptable.
yes,yes,yes,I really love this phone for all the great Samsung features it comes with and I LOVE using SAMSUNG PAY however I wish this phone had a memory card option for more storage other than that. I am loving this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"It has a sleek design and performs great!i love the color,it has great HD,I would highly recommend this product to a friend. It was relatively cheap and great performance"
yes,yes,yes,"Functionality is great, picture quality is fantastic. I love my phone."
yes,yes,yes,I used to own an Iphone (for past more that years) but for better camera switched to Galaxy S6 and made a big mistake. I am a moderate phone user and thus neither have many apps installaed on my PC nor use it for gaming. Only my daughter plays on phone once in while.
yes,no,yes,"This is a beautiful phone with attractive design and stunning color,I love my gold platinum S6 ,the only concern is that the battery drains fast and my charging port is defective."
yes,yes,yes,"I do really like this phone. I wish it was possible to costomize the interface, and Im not talking about the way it looks but the way it works. It would be nice to be able to have a different kind of interaction with the screen like force touch."
no,no,no,"As much as I am a Samsung Fan!, it's battery drained within 6 months and I am trying to get it fixed but no luck!"
yes,yes,yes,Got a new phone works perfectly. I like the service.
no,yes,yes,"I love my S6! However, I do not like that the entire frame is made of glass....I drop my phone constantly and even though I put a good case on the phone, it had already broken within the first week."
yes,no,yes,I like my Galaxy S6 but I wish it was available the same smaller size like the S4. Also the golden mirrored color was all that was available at my local Verizon is absolutely blinding and should be replaced to customers who had no other options. Thank you
yes,yes,yes,I don't have many complaints other than the battery life being a bit low. Nice look. Also doesn't get as hot as my previous models.
no,yes,no,This device gets extremely hot very quickly. Dies within 45 to an hour after taking it off charger at 100%. It lags and the screen is very bipolar it decides to work and then a second later it won't I absolutely hate this device.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Many built in features, great design and easy to use. Battery life is very good"
yes,yes,yes,"Long story short..UNEXPECTED upgrade due to failing Galaxy S3 which I was not wanting to part with. Trouble with activation and transferring files but once I downloaded the Samsung Switch on both devices, everything worked smoothly. Now taking time to customize phone and edit bloatware."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome! It's thin, light, fast, and beautiful in the gold platinum color."
yes,yes,yes,"My S6 has been flawless since i got it. Its fallen off my bike at 35mph and tumbled down the road with barely a scratch. Its thin, livhtweight, battery lasts all day, its very fast, customizable and enjoyable to use. Much better than the iphone 6 i had before."
yes,yes,yes,"Had the S3, S5,.now the S6. Like this one best of all I've had. Really easy to switch to new ones each time also. Can't wait to get the Note 7 when contract allows."
no,yes,yes,"I am on my third Samsung S6 in a year. I take very good care of my phone just poorly designed. When I bought this phone brand new the camera went out in a week. They sent me a ""certified like new"" phone. Have had issues with this phone holding a charge."
yes,yes,yes,"I will never own anything else. Samsung Galaxy S6 is the greatest phone ever, and I will be buying the S7 Active when I can. Samsung makes it easy to own and so easy to use. Thank you to Samsung, you TOTALLY ROCK!!!!! ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺"
yes,yes,yes,I have recently acquired a Samsung Galaxy 6 telephone and I think it is totally awesome!!!! The features are incredible and in addition I purchased the Samsung wireless charging station.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone this is my second Samsung Galaxy, It does everything for you .Plenty of apps and even tells you when it needs updates"
yes,yes,yes,I have had this product for a long time Samsung is the best product I have ever purchased. Not only you is it very reliable as far as breaking easy it also answers almost any question I have. It does everything for me and I love it. I also love the way the pictures come out.
yes,yes,yes,"It is a good all around phone, especially if you like taking pictures. But my camera has had a hard time focusing since i got it and makes a weird noise."
yes,yes,yes,"This product is absolutely amazing. I recently switched from an iPhone 6s and I don't know why I haven't switched sooner. The speed of the phone is amazing. The only thing I wish it had was better battery life and an expandable memory port. Other than that, definitely recommend to a friend."
no,no,no,my only problem with the phone is the back is very weak and had a small Crack and kept cracking as time went on
yes,yes,yes,"I love my galaxy. The screen, pictures and video are great"
no,no,yes,Way too expensive for the superficial quality.
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung Galaxy 6. It does everything I need it to do. I now want the seven (7). I don't go anywhere without it.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has several great features I would recommend this phone to anyone

yes,yes,yes,This product is good has a lot of features easy to use light weight these are all things I like
yes,yes,yes,This is one of the best phones I have ever owned. It's beautiful looking and has great features. It's everything you would expect from a Samsung product!
no,yes,yes,The phone had a great design but in all honesty the battery life sucks.
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy using this phone I will purchase again and I will tell all my friends
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about it.is fun to use never boring.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone-and I love that it can keep up with my million tabs and having a ton of apps open at once!
yes,yes,yes,"The best feature on this phone is the camera! Takes amazing pictures! The music apps aren't good, won't let me use the songs for ring tones. I can't use my music from the cloud as ring tones or contact id's."
yes,yes,yes,Very fast and snappy even with multiple applications open. Color is great.
yes,yes,yes,I had this phone first now My daughter uses the S6 and it's awesome.
yes,yes,yes,I love the look of my phone. I am also pleased with how it's always on top with updates. There's always something new. Very user friendly.
yes,yes,yes,I really like the performance of the phone. The battery life is better. Seems to run smoothly and without problems. The camera takes great pictures. My friend who has the IPhone is amazed and will be switching.
yes,yes,yes,I love all of the featuresecond that go along with the Galaxy S6 such as the fingerprint reader as well as the multitasking capabilities. Would recommend to anyone interested in an android phone with a sleek design.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is gorgeous great performance and styling
yes,yes,yes,"I just love, love my Samsung galaxy s6. Its sleek design and the sharpness of pics and vibrant colors and its easy to manage with one hand and the different apps the opening of different apps at the same time and high definition and the quick chargeand even if it didn't have all this ;I'd still love..."
yes,yes,yes,The S6 is a great looking and functioning phone. It beats all other models that I have had hands down.Only caveat is that battery life is not as long as I expected. I have remedied by carrying a charger pack which I really don't want.
yes,yes,yes,"It runs smoothly, doesn't get hot when using, takes excellent pictures... I've had no problems with this device and I'm glad I purchased it!"
yes,yes,yes,Love all the features and the phone itself. Had for a few months and I've yet to have any issues.
yes,yes,yes,"Although the S6 is a very solid phone, you are further ahead to buy the S7 with removable memory support, better camera, better processor and more reliable fingerprint security sensor"
yes,yes,yes,"The Galaxy S6 32 GB is hands down one of the best phones that I have owned, truly one of Samsungs greatest products, recommend this phone to anyone who wants full customization along with comfort in your hand. Great job Samsung!"
yes,yes,yes,"Great camera, very sharp, clear, HD. Battery life isn't that great of course, and became worse after a Samsung update. Nice, strong screen."
yes,yes,yes,The only thing I would have not changed was the water proofing s5 and s7 but not the s6 I love your guys products I can't wait to convince my wife to change. Thanks a lot for your hard work.
yes,yes,yes,"I only have one complaint, really."
yes,yes,yes,Great salesman told me this phone was as good as a s7.....I don't think so.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is easy to use, not to big and after being caught in the rain, with a different phone, I like the water resistant feature."
yes,yes,yes,"I love that it's really thin, but my phone is huge. It doesn't fit in my pocket very well, and sometimeshe I feel that it's going to fall out of my pocket. Also, I love the way my phone looks, but because it's made of glass, and I'm a cluts. It's bound to break way too easily."
yes,yes,yes,I have no complaints it works great with everything that I need it for plus more
yes,yes,yes,The Galaxy S6 is a phone with great features. The display is crisp and the camera takes great pictures. The phone's case is stunning but the back of the phone makes you think it will slip out of your hands. A low profile case solved that issue although I hate covering up the sleek look.
yes,yes,yes,"The performance of the phone is excellent as well as the specs and design and the phone has many nice features built in. The phones design is sleek with rounded edges and a nice glass back and the only con is that you cannot insert an sd card for music. But, overall, I am happy with my purchase!"

yes,yes,yes,"I have had the galaxy 6s for a few months now and I am very impressed. Before getting this phone, I had an outdated smartphone and I'm loving all the features and options. I also like playing around with my camera. It takes great pictures."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone. I can text more than one person at a time and keep up with my kids.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy 6 is by far more superior than the intended phone .Camera quality is outstanding and battery life is amazing..I will recommend this phone to anybody
no,no,no,The only thing i dont care for is all the extra apps. They are stuck you cant delete them. They take up memory and space that can be used elsewhere.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is the best I have had. I love his camara
yes,yes,yes,Lover my Samsung 6! Best phone ever had! Would and gave recommend it to my friends.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It is great! Samsung always makes a great product.
yes,yes,yes,"Let start by saying this is a really nice phone! I really like the screen and cameras. The battery life, not so much. It's not a huge bother since it has fast charging. 32GB for the base storage is nice too and more than enough to for me. Android marshmallow is great too."
yes,yes,yes,"You did it again, Samsung. My S6 sublimely simplifies my daily routine."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has so many fun features that make keeping up with my busy life so much easier. I live by this phone. It's light, fashionable, and so user-friendly with the hands-free motion usage - not just when driving but especially when working or cooking so I don't have to stop what I'm doing to..."

yes,yes,yes,I have always loved Samsung phones but I very much love my S6 the most of any I have had. No locking up or memory issues my S5 sometimes had. The only way they could pry this phone from my hands is by handing me an S7!
no,no,no,"This is the first time I've had a Samsung phone in a while, so it was a little frustrating learning some basic things. After a few weeks, my screen got too sensitive, so I had to get a new one. And then the new one I got wasn't working, so I had to get a new one again."
yes,yes,yes,I think the Samsung Galaxy S6 is really good. It had a lot of features like the Thumb prints and is really good. Highly recommend this product. Or the S7.
yes,yes,yes,"Love the shape, size, screen view of this phone. Since it is my first smart phone, still getting used to the things it does and can do for me. Have had a little difficulty locating some features but it is fairly easy to navigate thru."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung s-6, I've had everything from the S-3 on, and have had great performance with each.."
yes,yes,yes,"I love the S6, much bigger than the 3 so I can see keys better and type easier"
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy S5. I loved that phone, it was great!Cons:"
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone. Screen size is perfect. Does all that I would like but I had a Samsung prior to this and it had a command to say to stop alarm or snooze and this model does not.
yes,yes,yes,I bought a 64 gig S6 because that's what I really wanted. I have never been happier with a phone in my life. I've owned numerous phones this one was so much easier to use. It does many more things then a phone probably needs to.
yes,no,yes,Has exellent GRAPHIC and the picture quality is well past greatr
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung has very clear and bright screen. The apps that are predownloaded are minimal and the flow is very fast and smooth.
yes,no,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S6 was my first smartphone. It is easy to set up and operate. You can learn more from the Samsung website than you can from the cellular store reps. It takes better pictures than my digital camera.
yes,yes,yes,"I have friends with iPhones, but the ease of use, design & features of my Galaxy are much better than theirs. I'm always told that the quality of my photos are better than on the iPhone."
yes,yes,yes,"My Galaxy S6 looks good, feels good, and performs fantastic."
yes,yes,yes,"This is a great phone,the camera is very fast and clear. Easy to scroll through the features and make adjustments."
yes,no,yes,Beautiful and powerful. If you're going to be using your phone to do stuff then (insider tip*) you've discovered the phone that can phone very well. Imagine a great white shark spray painting the word 'luxe' on public property. Be rebellious. Be free.
yes,yes,yes,Great device and easy to use will be upgrading to the 7 soon

yes,yes,yes,"I really like this phone and its ability, i do wish it was waterproof though, i also really like the gold"
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S6 is a great phone just wish it had the removable storage like the S3 and S4 I have owned. I lost a lot of pictures due to water damage from a rain storm I was caught in. With removable storage I would still have all those pictures.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has been the best phone I have ever had. I don't know what I was thinking why it took me so long to get this one. I love the features, the apps that came with it, and the screen and the audio is absolutely amazing!!!! I wouldn't get another brand of phone ever again!!"
yes,yes,yes,I had the Galaxy 5S and did not think I would like the S6. I am very happy I did get it! I've had it for about 3 months now and am still finding new things that are awesome!!
yes,yes,yes,Everything on this phone is great! I feel in love with this phone when I first got it.
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy s6 is great and easy to understand. I like the graphics and processor on it as well. I wish I could have waited for the s7 for the water resistant feature but overall I'm satisfied.
yes,yes,yes,"The camera is fantastic! The phone is reliable and functional. I have not been thrilled with some of the Android updates, but that is not a reflection of a great phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I love all the improvements on this phone the weight, the camera, and all the features on the OS have been great."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my 4th Samsung and this phone is sleek and nice. generally easy to use with a slightly brighter screen for outside, an excellent camera and overall easy to use functions. Only things I see need an improvement on are making the keyboard touch adjustable to some degree as its very sensitive or..."
yes,yes,yes,Nice size display. Great camera action. Love the double tap to get the camera going right away!
no,yes,yes,"The camera makes a weird noise when opening up the camera app or an app that uses the camera, such as Snapchat or Instagram. Other than that I love Samsung products, and this one doesn't fall short in any way."

yes,yes,yes,Great materials sturdy feeling not cheap like s5. Superfast great camera. Nothing to fault. Fingerprint scanner greatly upgraded.
no,yes,no,"The batterie in the s6 is garbage. I have had this phone for about three weeks now, and on a full charge if you browse the Internet for 15 minutes it knocks you're batterie down to around 80-85% with the power saving mode on. Horrible batterie design."

Easier selfies."
no,yes,no,The first phone worked great for the first 2 months. Then is started getting really sluggish. I clean everything out and it was still sluggish. Then is started getting slow reaction. I'd click on a letter while texting and it would take two or three times for it to register.
no,no,yes,"Love the phone however, battery life after 9 months is terrible. After a full charge overnight it must charged again around 4PM or it's dead by 8. This with light usage.Also wish the hand gestures that I had with the S4 would have been carried to the S6."

yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from a galaxy s4 to galaxy s6. I love it!

yes,yes,yes,The phone is pretty great. I love the camera it takes awesome pics. The speed and reliability of the phone is second to none. I wish the battery life was a little longer but with the high speed charging and the ability to use a wireless charging pad is awesome.
yes,yes,yes,"My favorite part about this phone is not waiting 5 minutes for the simplest things. Second to that it's pretty durable, my iphone would have shattered if dropped from two inches off the ground, my galaxy had not even a scratch on it and I have dropped it a handful of times."
yes,yes,yes,My galaxy has been great and reliable. Loving the battery life! Amazing pictures and I haven't dropped any calls
yes,yes,yes,The battery charges fast but doesn't last long (even with power saving mode enabled). The screen lock button is in an awkward place. Sometimes the lock and incoming call screens lag.

yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! Very many features & easy to use. Lots to learn about. Many apps & a lot of storage space.

yes,yes,yes,The South is everything I need in a cell phone. Love all the features.
yes,yes,yes,I have had phones in the past. But I have never had a phone that works this great.

no,no,yes,"The swipe security is very frustrating. Periodically, it just quits working and you need to redo your fingerprints and it still won't work for a day or so. Screen capture is very touchy as well. Nice feature if it would work, but typically takes 4 or more tries."
yes,yes,yes,"I went from the S5 to the St and it's very similar. Not thrilled with the alarm clock as it's difficult to set/change at times, but most functions work really well. Wish it went a little faster, but I also have a lot of apps."
yes,yes,yes,"I just purchased the phone a few weeks ago and been learning the new features. It seems however, to be lagging and a bit slower loading internet sites than the S4 was. Not sure why that is. Overall, I'm enjoying it though."

yes,no,yes,"I'm very happy with this phone. It moves a lot faster than the past androids that I have had from other manufactures. This is my first Samsung, and I am sold on this brand.

yes,yes,yes,I went from the S4 to the S6. I miss some of the features that are on the S4. I'm still learning about the S6 features. I suppose I assumed it would have the same features as the S4 and then some. Instead they removed some of the things I liked from the S4 and had become familiar with.

yes,yes,yes,I was going to spend money on a good camera until I started using my new Samsung phone. This phone takes amazing pictures!
no,yes,no,"I have tried repeatedly to use the Fingerprint lock and it does not to work. I must have tried at least 10 times, erasing the previous fingerprints I had in there and starting over. This is a big disappointment because I would think this could be a secure feature for the phone."

I love asking Google questions!"
yes,yes,yes,"My new Samsung Galaxy S6 is definitely the best phone I have ever had! At the age of 72, I was reluctant to get a phone with so many features. At first I felt intimindated, but once I started attending"

yes,yes,yes,"I have upgraded from the s5, the S6 is so much better! Battery is better and it operates smoothly."
yes,yes,yes,My favorite thing so far is the ability to download themes for my phone some even with matching screen savers!!
yes,yes,yes,"Super fast, surprisingly decent battery life a d amazing camera. Makes me happy."
yes,no,yes,I had the S5 previously which was great but the S6 is a new era in performance. I have the 32GB version due to no SD card feature. I have been satisfied without the SD card mostly because I have had SD card failures in the past. I am enjoying Samsung Pay for the 1st time.
yes,yes,yes,"I saw a review on You Tube, and was very pleased.But once I received one, I was even more pleased.Love the slim, smooth, lightweight design.. Easy access to all the features.I only had it for just a week, so there's probably more things I'm not aware of yet."

yes,yes,yes,"I had an upgrade and didn't know what to get, so I researched and decided this was exactly that I wanted. Great camera, love the rapid charge, very easy to use. So glad I got this phone"
yes,yes,yes,i deleted a vocie message after recording and it still save to a different file. Not good.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone quality and performance is great. The system runs efficient and has many great features.

yes,no,yes,I like the samsung galaxy s6 because the new features are cool and are very useful.
yes,yes,yes,"Even though the phone is big, it's thin and light. Making it perfect to carry in your pants pocket. Display is crisp and clear. The phone itself is a beautiful design, love the gold color. Would recommend this phone to everyone."
no,no,no,"Unfortunately, the phone needs to be near a charger. I get less than 6 hours after a charge, and I don't make many calls. My S4 only needed a daily charge. Changing batteries is no longer an option."
yes,yes,yes,"I was skeptical when I first got this phone. I previously had a druid ultra maxx and loved it. Due to a variety of reasons I got this one. It took me about two days to fully get used to it and appreciate it. I would heavily recommend this phone to anyone. It is fast, smart, and very cool looking."
yes,no,yes,"I loved my S3 so I was so excited to upgrade to the S6. I read a lot of reviews that praised all the great features of the S6, but many warned about how bad the battery life was. I didn't take them as seriously as I should have."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone!! The texting is easy! Using apps, the phone, almost every part of this phone is great! My only problem is how slippery the back it. It's almost too smooth. If I put it on certain surfaces it slips off. It's almost like it's made slippery just so you have to buy a case for it."
yes,yes,yes,Very pleased with this product. I do wish the battery charge would last longer.
yes,yes,yes,I bought my phone only a short time ago and it works excellently. It is loaded with the latest and greatest technology. I would for sure recommend it to other people.Although the phone has one drawback. The battery life could be better. Seems the screen draws a lot of power.
yes,yes,yes,"Love the look, the ease of use and the quick battery charge. Love this phone"
yes,yes,yes,First off my Galaxy tablet is awesome and I love it. But goin from the Galaxy S4 to a Galaxy S6 phone left a lot to be desired. Its really nothing more than an S4 with a few upgrades. Nothing worth mentioning either.
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone! I could not be happier. It stays charged longer than any phone I've ever had. It works great and has so many cool features. It takes awesome pictures! And, it looks so good. I have had bunches of people ask me what kind of phone I have because they love the way it looks."
yes,yes,yes,This is ahead of it's time with features I did not know phones had yet. User friendly and so far very fast and stable.

yes,yes,yes,I've been using galaxy phones for years. You couldn't pay me to switch to an iPhone.
yes,yes,yes,"Although this is my first top of the line phone i've had. It is very nice! It has no problem running any game, or multitasking with its 8 core processer. The battery life is pretty good if you just use it as a phone or browsing the web, the bright colorful oled display can eat your battery when..."

yes,yes,yes,My wife and I both needed new phones. My wife was the first to get the S6. The next day I decided to upgrade. I contemplated getting the iPhone but couldn't justify the cost. I really like the new os. Neither of us regret the upgrade and look forward to our next Samsung phone!

yes,yes,yes,I use to have an iPhone and apps that you can get from apple that you had to pay can get it free on Samsung. There's a lot of restrictions on the iPhone and the Samsung there isn't.
yes,yes,yes,"I like this phone. However, I feel like it is confusing having so many options for apps, texting, etc. The camera and video are great."
yes,yes,yes,"A very nice phone, I've enjoyed it. I love the pictures it takes and it is lighter than the S5"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone works well... But I find it freezing and losing battery power rather quickly and frequently. Otherwise the appearance is cute. The phone takes good pictures, great for texting, and great for phone calls."

yes,yes,yes,I'm so in love with this phone especially since this is my first galaxy ever!!! Samsung really out did theirselves with this phone...the camera is awesome clear videos along with clear pics including selfies!!
yes,yes,yes,"This is one of the best smart phones I've ever owned. It's fast and very easy to use. The only draw back is the battery, it could be designed to last longer. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone."
yes,yes,yes,I had an iPhone for 3 years and just switched to a galaxy s6. I love it. The only thing I am unhappy about is the battery. It doesn't even last a day. I'll barley use it for the day and it will die.
yes,yes,yes,"I really like the dual screen feature that allows you to have 2 apps open at once. Also, I like the dedicated back button, the lack of which made my previous phone frustrating."
yes,yes,yes,I love how easy it is top get to what you need. The design of the phone could be better. My chubby hands hits things on the screen.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone instantly grabbed my attention when I first got a glimpse of it. The design is so flawless! After seeing the phone I instantly knew the performance and everything else about it would be flawless as well, and it was!"

I still have not uncovered the myriad of additional features but ""help"" is always available whether through chatting or going to the community or back to store where I upgraded cell from.The cell is..."

yes,yes,yes,"After using this phone for well over a month, I have had ZERO issues whatsoever with using it. As the tech increases, so does the learning curve, but that goes with any phone these days.

yes,yes,yes,S6 is a durable and reliable phone. Love the glass on the back and slim design.
yes,yes,yes,"I have always loved iPhone until I switched to the Galaxy and I can honestly say that there is no comparison. The Galaxy performance is outstanding. The pictures are so breathtakingly beautiful, that they look like a professional photographer took them."

yes,yes,yes,Best phone i have ever had large screen makes it perfect for gaming.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is amazing I love its design and how it feels like it was made to be in my hand.

But when it does it will definately be a 10/10 for me!
yes,yes,yes,Camera has cool options....clear crisp colors...speakers are pretty good. Need an app for direct one touch dial shortcut...phone overall is just easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,This smartphone is everything that I need. Only problem was how long it took me to customize it to my preferences.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone the only things I don't like is the spam that keeps popping up, and the keyboard is a little wierd for me."
no,yes,yes,This is a great phone but it has charging issues. I plug it in & it says use original charger. I am using charger it came with. Battery actually went down when it was plugged in. I tried to exchange it but it wouldn't do it in store. Go figure. I keep plugging & unplugging to get it charge.
yes,yes,yes,"Its sleek, beautiful with out the case and it has everything you would ever want for a phone. The camera is great except the beauty face for selfies that bothered me at first but it will make you forget about your old phone"
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful new lines and I love the new gold color. Tools and apps are lightening fast and the graphics are great!
yes,yes,yes,"I recently switched from the IPhone 5c to the Galaxy S6 and I'm soooo happy I did! It's got so much more to offer, way more data, battery life and I learn something new each day I'm on it.Just want to thank the Verizon representative for suggesting this switch! You won't be disappointed."
yes,yes,yes,Great features and great phone. Can not be beat. The best ever.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone and features. The back glass was broken almost immediately. Other than the glass back, love the phone. Can not find a replacement back glass in my color."
yes,yes,yes,I have had Samsung phones and now tablets for 10 years now. And I LOVE THEM! The best there is. I had a Samsung Galaxy S3 then moved up to a Samsung Galaxy S6 and OMG the difference in them. AMAZING. AWESOME pictures!!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,I like the unit and I am learning more about it every day. Good features but more than I really need. I would get it again.
yes,yes,yes,"There is much to like about this phone: versatility, security features, highly readable screen, great color, fine cameras (front and rear), quick charging, and durability.I have just a couple of quibbles: 1) lack of user-upgradeable battery and SD card; and 2) it would be nice if the virtual..."
yes,yes,yes,"Love my phone, it is so much fun to use. I feel like there is a surprise waiting for me around every corner. Galaxy S6 makes the simple things like texting a joy!!"
yes,yes,yes,I enjoy this galaxy s6. I like it a lot better than the s4. I have an iPhone 4 for a work phone and hate it. This galaxy is a lot better than both.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! Was considering the iPhone 6 but it was still too small and the 6plus would have been like talking into a waffle. Every feature is so intuitive. Can't say enough about it.
yes,yes,yes,"THIS PHONE IS AN UPGRADE FROM MY SAMSUNG GALAXY BLAZE. IT HAS SOME NICE NEW FEATURES....OVERALL IT'S A FINE PHONE BUT I THINK A BIT PRICEY. IN FACT ALL THE SMART PHONES HAVE BECOME A BIT PRICEY AND NOW WITH THE MAJOR CARRIERS NOT OFFERING DISCOUNTED PRICES ANYMORE, NOT SURE I WILL STAY WITH A..."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone, love the design and color, got the gold very pretty!!"
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone, amazing battery, amazing camera, all around great phone. If you have never used android it could get confusing, but it has limitless customization options. I haven't found a problem with this phone yet (though to keep it running it's fastest you should restart once a day or every..."
yes,yes,yes,"Obviously reviews are just opinions. Every device has different features. What is great for one person may not be for another. One must prioritize what they want/need from a device. For me, a great camera is top priority. Second is a great screen with high resolution and lots of pixels."
yes,yes,yes,Out of all my phones this is by far the best the camera is probably the best feature because it takes such pretax pictures
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is overall good! It's a bit expensive, but I don't think there is a better phone out currently."
yes,yes,yes,I love my Samsung Galaxy S6. It is easy to use and the perfect size for a smart phone. It works well with my apps and even works to watch movies on. The only issue I have (might be my fault) I can not listen to my music on my speaker. The phone will not connect but the is not a deal brraker.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has everything I need to manage my life.
yes,yes,yes,I LOVE MY PHONE I WOULD RECOMMEND TO ALL MY FRIENDS
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Samsung S6, it is a great phone and I have always loved Samsung products and have always owned Samsung products. There are a few items that I would have loved to see with the S6 that I had with the S5, but overall I love my new phone, I love the color (gold) and I love the look of it, rich..."
yes,yes,yes,"So far the phone has worked great. I have one drop so far after only two weeks and not a mark on the phone, thank goodness!So happy I switched from an Iphone to this, apart from being a bit larger it seems to work extremely well and much improved with my applications for work.."
yes,yes,yes,"It's nice but not a lot different then the S5 no big improvements that are noticeable to the everyday user. The camera is sweet but not that easy to get the hang of, when starting out. Would of liked to see more ""new"" or even just different features then the S5."
yes,yes,yes,I am very pleased with the performance of my new phone
yes,yes,yes,I love my samsung galaxy s6 it is amazing it has everything I could ask for and not hard to use and the camera is great the sound is so loud I don't know how they could make the phone any better its great foe everything it makes my life so much easier for work and pleasure I love samsung products...
yes,yes,yes,I am a huge Samsung fan but this S6 is really nice and the gold color adds a nice touch.
yes,yes,yes,love the features on phone can do lots work and apps together. I would have rather got the belt clip protector in stead of the regular protector.
yes,yes,yes,I have been impressed with the function of this phone. It is easy to use. The battery life is good. I thought it might be lacking. But it has been great. I would recommend this phone to anyone who is either right or left handed.
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone I had s4 and upgraded to s6. It is everything I would expect from a samsung unit.
yes,yes,yes,"Screen is excellent and phone has great performance, haven't noticed any Lag and haven't had any issue. The only con I see is the speaker location"
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, the best I've had. Love it. Very happy with this purchase."
yes,yes,yes,"This is the first Smartphone I have ever owned. Not having been part of the computer age, I was apprehensive about owning one. However, my fears are gone. I am far from being able to use and know everything that I can do with this, but I am learning quickly and daily."
no,no,no,The screen cracked on the first day I had it. I hadn't dropped it or anything. Started as a small crack and the went all the way down my phone. It runs terribly allow. My Note 3 that was 2.5 years old was way faster. I wish I would've waited until the Note 5 came out.
yes,yes,yes,I have had several Samsung phones and this phone is by far the best phone I have used. The photos are breathtaking and the overall handling of the phone is great.
yes,yes,yes,It's hard for me to choose anything other than a Galaxy phone because the format of the phone is amazing and so easy to use. I love the ability to personalize the phone to however I want it to be. The screen looks beautiful and the camera still surprises me that the pictures taken are from a phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Anything I need, is just a tap away. It's my camera, my laptop, my phone and entertainment at a tap of a button! The Samsung S6 is easy to use, lightweight and fun to use....i love it!"
yes,yes,yes,"I recently purchased a Galaxy S 6 and I live it! I've been a Samsung loyal customer for some time and they never seem to let us as consumers , down! Always surprising and exceeding expectations . I would rather have a Samsung then a iPhone anyday ."
yes,yes,yes,I wish the camera zoomed in more other than that so far no complaints..
yes,yes,yes,"I just want to say that I just upgraded to the Samsung 6, and I love the new features easier to operate with the 32GB memory. Love it.."
yes,yes,yes,"That big screen is fantastic! Yet the phone still fits in a shirt pocket. Performance is very fast. Camera is awesome! And it also works very well as a phone, including the sound quality on speakerphone."
yes,yes,yes,I have always had an iPhone... But since getting the galaxy 5. I can honestly say I would never go back to an iPhone!!! The Galaxy takes amazing pictures and videos. Easy to use. Lots of options to buy apps. I'll never go back to an iPhone!!!
yes,yes,yes,"I really enjoying my new ohone, the fact that I can check my heart rate"
yes,yes,yes,I had a s4 previously and I really enjoyed it and now this is much better it does a lot more for some reason when I turn it off or get out of a thing it goes to the camera I don't know why yet I'm going to check with Verizon and see if there something to be done about that but all in all it's a...
yes,yes,yes,"Phone is fast and sleek, lightweight, love themes, charges very quick, dies to fast for me and is overheats fairly easily, it would be better if it had an 808 processor or was made out of a material other than glass that would distributed heat better. Overall a great product though"
yes,yes,yes,one of the best cell phones i have ever had....it has a fast charger from 0 to 35% in 25 min
no,yes,yes,"mine is constantly saying internet not available even when using wi-fi, i think that i might have purchased a rejected phone as a new phone."
yes,yes,yes,"It's amazingly quick and efficient, with lots of customizable apps. Calling is clear, messaging is fast, and I can't find any fault with it except for the big security hole with Android. I highly recommend it!!!"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is easy to use, the screen is sone clear and the microphone is great."
yes,yes,yes,"I just got this for within the last 30 days and I absolutely love it. I still have more features to play with and figure out, but the photo quality is excellent, the sound is terrific, and I can hear the person on the other end clearly."
yes,yes,yes,"I am the proud owner of a Samsung Galaxy 6, a Gear S, and a Note Pro SMP900. As you can tell, I am extremely happy with Samsung products. I purchased the Note Pro first, then the Galaxy 6, and finally the Gear S."
yes,yes,yes,I just love my 6 it's very handi battery charge quick it's light weight many features Samsung did there thing once again
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a big improvement over my old one. The screen is very clear. It takes excellent pictures and video. I like the health apps that came with it. Not everyone may be thrilled, but I'm having fun having it count my steps and take my pulse."
yes,yes,yes,"Love the ease of use of this phone. It is fast, provides all the information I need and then some! Love the ability to check my heart rate and O2 levels."
yes,yes,yes,I love my galaxy s6 phone. Would of liked the curve but the price was too high. 3 months after the release the phone never came down in price. Samsung I know you could do better pricing wise. Other than that it's a awesome phone. I went from the s4 to the s6 skipping the s5.
yes,no,yes,"Loving my new Samsung Galaxy S6 phone. I had the S4 for 2 years and liked it, but was going to switch to Iphone until I played with this phone. The S6 beats out Iphone 6's camera in both clarity, sharpness, and color as well as handles lower light so much better."
yes,yes,yes,"Such an awesome phone. It's lightning fast and despite the smaller battery than the previous galaxy iteration I still end the day with greater than 30%. This is the best looking, and best performing galaxy phone yet."
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful design. The platinum gold phone is like no other. Traded my iPhone for the S6 and it has been a good decision so far.
yes,yes,yes,I just upgraded from a Galaxies 4 and was pleasantly surprised to find many of the new features blended seemlessly. Obvious one's like the camera and access to the sim card and others like longer battery life. It made getting used to it easy and familer.
yes,yes,yes,"Love it! Definitely the best galaxy phone by far. Very happy with it,"
yes,yes,yes,I have had an iPhone for many years. When i got my S6 I was worried I wouldn't like it. It did take a few days to figure out some of the features but I love it! The quality is much better and the camera is amazing!
yes,yes,yes,I like this phone. It was easy to find most features and settings. The only thing missing was the option for call waiting. All of line guides led you to a setting that wasn't there.
yes,yes,yes,"it is beautiful , I love it , it has everything I need. the battery lasts long enough . it is fast , it is not very large and it is perfect"
no,yes,yes,I wasn't sure I would like the new phone as I was coming from a very basic and was afraid all the stuff that this phone now did would just be left at the way side so what was the point. I have really gotten into it keeps track of appts. play games when bored or just waiting look at email.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone but not impressed. Lovedo the s5 better.
yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy s6 is a great device. It has tons of features and even more hidden features in the settings. The highlights though are the screen, the fingerprint sensor, the camera, and the great design and overall feel of the phone."
yes,yes,yes,it is a nice but but with in 1 week i was going over my data plan with all the up grades and new software. My S3 i never got close.
yes,yes,yes,had Samsung 3 the 5 is faster and easy to use like the camera
yes,yes,yes,"I really am happy with my phone. It's so classy and works well. The camera is amazing. Now I can take pictures of my family and have clear, vivid pictures."
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I have seen or used. It has everything you need in a phone. The camera is another great feature. It has the speed and is user friendly
yes,yes,yes,Love everything about this phone from day one.
yes,yes,yes,"I only buy Samsung products for a reason, they are very easy to use and great features. But this Samsung Galaxy S6 is buy far the BEST/My Favorite so far. I would recommend to anyone looking for a great phone with easy to use features"
yes,yes,yes,"If you're getting bored of the iPhone, switch to the Samsung Galaxy."
no,yes,yes,"I previously owned a samsung 3 and as it aged it was not holding a charge, the phone was easily overheated and the screen would freeze requiring a restart."
no,yes,no,"I was so excited for the first week I had this phone. Then the problems started. So far, my phone has turned off in the middle of the night twice (fully charged AND plugged in!). I had to force re-boot it to get it to turn back on."
no,yes,no,Had issues with the back button and also replacement had issues with the mic. It would only work if on speaker or headset.
yes,yes,yes,Ever since I got my Samsung Galaxy s6 I've loved it more than my apple Ipod and I don't know where I would be now without this phone because it's such an awesome phone!
yes,yes,yes,"The Samsung Galaxy S6 is, by far, the best mobile phone available today. From the sleek appearance to its lighting fast response, it out performs all the competition."
yes,yes,yes,It has awesome battery life.. great display. .great for movies and gaming. ..
yes,no,yes,I have had an iPhone before my Samsung. I love this phone over the iPhone. You get to customize it your own way. There's more features than the iPhone. So many apps that's applicable to your daily life.
yes,yes,no,"Let's go through some of the negatives that are well known by now, no SD card slot, no removable battery and no waterproofing. These things alone would be enough for a poor review normally, but switching the phone on and using it will soon make you forget about the changes."
yes,yes,yes,I have always had Iphone's. Wanted to branch out this time. I have the Iphone 6 and now the Galaxy S6. I like the options that the Android IOS gives me.. The one thing that has held me back from given it a 100% rating is the scrolling. The scroll in the Iphone is smooth. Not so in the Galaxy S6.
yes,yes,yes,I was really looking forward to the 6 being thew last phone I would need for a while but I don't think so. Verizon has already replaced one phone in 3 months for a screen problem and I am not at all happy with the battery performance which was supposed to better than my S5.
yes,yes,yes,I loved my 4. It did multi tasking well. The 6 does not. The 6 camera is bettter. My first 6 died during an app update. Then there were app compatability issues. I removed half of the apps on my second 6 that I normally used and disabled all the pre-installed apps I'd never use.
yes,yes,yes,I was an iPhone user until I tried my friends galaxy S4 now I switched to the S4 myself and I just upgraded to the S6 which I think is amazing. They did a great job with this upgrade that my father just upgraded from the S5 to the S6 while I was on vacation to visit them in Florida and he loves it.
yes,yes,yes,"I have been in love with this phone the first time I saw it. It does so many wonderful things that if I tried to say them all I wouldn't have enough room. The camera, the handling of the phone. The size....everything is just perfect for me"
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. Great battery life,the camera takes fabulous pictures. Too many features to compliment. Great phone!"
yes,no,yes,Upgraded from an s4 and the transition was simple! Only difference is everything is better especially the camera!
yes,yes,yes,Love the extra features with the S6 especially the wireless charging.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is amazing works great easily the best phone I've used
yes,yes,yes,"I like the phone, but the home button and power/lock key are none responsive some times."
yes,yes,yes,Everything going is nice and handy once you get used to it. I find something new every day.
yes,yes,yes,"From the sleek design to the clarity, this phone gives me life!"
yes,yes,yes,"I am a REALTOR in North Metro Atlanta, and very dependent on my mobile device. I have used the Droid technology for several years, however, was still apprehensive about changing Mobiles. I have found the Samsung to be better, faster, and as easy as what I have become accustomed to."
yes,yes,yes,This phone has a great look and feal to it. It runs solid and fast with no lag or issues. I prefer this device over my other phones I have had in the past.
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is so much faster than the s5 I had before, it is just amazing!"
yes,yes,yes,I recently upgraded to the Galaxy S6 from the Galaxy S4. While it took me a little bit of time to get used to the larger device I absolutely love it. I really don't know how I lived without these features before this. I love this phone and will recommend it to all family and friends.
yes,yes,yes,"It's fast, good performance, nice new features, charges fast! But it getseems very hot sometimes I don't understand why. I don't use my phone when it's charging! And I let it charge until 100 then I take it off of the charger."
no,yes,yes,"This is a good phone but is missing a few key elements in my opinion. 1. is a flash for the front camera, I am not a selfie person but the majority of people are and it would be sorely missed. 2. There is a way to auto reject calls but not texts, marketing advertisements come in text form too. 3."
yes,yes,yes,"Really this phone has almost everything you could want. Amazing camera, great screen, beautiful design and forward-looking features. However battery life is bad (helped by quick charge and wireless charging), and the performance is my biggest issue."
yes,yes,yes,"Much faster than an iPhone . I like that it is not a really large phone. I like that I am able to put it in my pocket. The camera on the phone is fantastic. Overall , really happy with it after owning iPhones for years.,"
yes,yes,yes,"Hello, I upgraded from the galaxy 3 and lobe the emojee and love the fingerprint lock screen alot. Over all I just love the phone."
yes,yes,yes,I just recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S6 per a friend's recommendation and I could not be happier with it. My sister and I both bought the same phone and both have an equally positive response to it. I love the design and features and find that its very fast in connecting online.
yes,no,yes,I like the curves and the design i would use samsung forever
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. I have no complaints.i can add tones to my messages. Easy to understand
yes,yes,yes,"I upgraded from an I-Phone to the Galaxy. I love the size and the features, no more squinting to obtain information. I should have upgraded sooner."
yes,yes,yes,Am still in the learning process.
yes,yes,yes,Great improvement over the S-3. Enjoy the speed improvement. Pictures seems easier to take and handle. Wish there was more information about using the phone; feel like I'm only using 10% of its capability.
yes,yes,yes,"Brand new to the smartphone experience and I did my homework prior to making my purchase. Across the board SG6 is rated higher than the ""other"" comparable smartphone out there. I also have a household full of Samsung products so I knew what to expect in quality of a device."
yes,yes,yes,"I like the phone, dont get me wrong. But it has some quirks it takes getting use to like sometimes it may freeze up to where you have to cut it off and on again. Overall though, I am happy with the choice."
yes,yes,yes,I had a S3 and upgraded to this S6. I am surprised at the features this phone has. I definitely like the wireless charger. It so convenient to charge my phone. The media features are tremendous and the phone responds quickly.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phones camera! It is very high quality. I switched from iPhone. The things I miss the most about my old phone would have to be Siri and the music app. I was able to transfer all my music from iTunes onto this phone after downloading iSync.
yes,yes,yes,I really enjoy my S6 I love the new features and the camera is awesome
yes,yes,yes,"I have used other Smart Phones before , But the SAMSUNG GALAXY S6 is the BEST by far .. I like the features ir has and overall operation is SUPERB !! .. I will recomend it over other Smart Phones on the market"
yes,yes,yes,"The S6 is an awesome phone! It is definitely an upgrade from the S4, which was a good phone! The S6 is just up to date and cool! Love my new phone!"
yes,yes,yes,the design of the samsung galaxy s6 is absolutely stunning. the glass back and aluminum sides is really great. I've dropped it so many times and it hasn't shown any damage. the feautures on it are amazing. although I do have to complain about the battery life. I'm a heavy phone user.
yes,yes,yes,I Love the style of this phone. Great Functions and the camera is beautiful
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone it does things I didn't know u could do on a phone.
yes,no,yes,The battery life is very short.I had to buy a battery charging cover.Otherwise the phone is great.
yes,yes,yes,I am a former iPhone user of many years. I recently switched to the Galaxy S6 and love it. The battery life alone has me sold. It also is much more user friendly in the aspect of being able to modify the look and usability of the device. It's has great features that other phones do not have.
yes,yes,yes,The phone is smooth fast and fashionable would recamend this phone to anybody.
yes,yes,yes,Never seen clarity like this from a camera phone u can take pics with this and expect it to be from a pro photographer epic
yes,yes,yes,It works better than I ever could have hoped. Great features and easy to use.
yes,yes,yes,I wasn't expecting to purchase a new phone when I went in to do a price check. I am very happy that I did. This phone is great. It takes great pictures. It is easy to navigate .
yes,yes,yes,"Really like the new slimness of the S6, I had a S4 and I liked it but love the light-weightlessness and the slimmer phone design of the S6. I like the Smiley emotions features in the messages of the S6."
yes,yes,yes,The update on this system is great. I think it is easier to use. The layout of features really work well. My only issue is you cant add an sd card. I cant afford the bigger gb. Overall I really love the phone. This is my 3rd samsung.
yes,yes,yes,"I've only had the phone for 2 weeks but so far I love it! It is very pretty, very fast and charges super quickly! Lots of space for apps. Don't love some of the preloaded stuff but will deal with that later as its not a big deal. :-)"
yes,yes,yes,Really love this phone. The options on the phone is really great
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about this phone speed disang
yes,yes,yes,"It's a good phone, but for what I use, it is not much different than my S4 was. Battery life is dismal, but you knew that, Now you cannot remove the battery so no bringing a back-up for a long flight."
no,no,no,Battery life is disappointing. Have issues with the phone shutting down when I turn off Bluetooth.
yes,yes,yes,I was a previous ios user for over 4 years. I love the storage space and speedy performance on the Samsung S6 compared to my previous device.
yes,yes,yes,"Sometimes challenged by today's technology, but having a Samsung III quickly fading and with a husband who would soon undergo surgery which required me to be in constant contact with family members across the country, I knew I had to upgrade. So glad I did!"

yes,yes,yes,This product is easy to learn for smartphone beginners.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has a long battery life. It charges really quickly too. It's easy to use. It takes fraet photos. It has an amazing speaker when listening to music and cake with awesome headphones as well. It is lightweight and thin.
yes,yes,yes,best phone ever love to video chat with my wife. Speaker volume is great.
yes,yes,yes,Love my Samsung s 6 phone will recommend this product to anyone .
yes,yes,yes,I love everything about the Galaxy S6 except for one feature. I was not able to block and reject some strange text from people I do not know. I was told that I have to add them to my contacts first before I can blocked them. This is a very frustrating situation.
yes,yes,yes,"I think this is a great phone, just needs to be a little faster, and also a better battery life, sometimes it's really slow, and I'm tired of charging half way threw the day"
no,no,yes,I am excited to be able to use the camera features to make pictures I need for displays. I have had fun learning how to use it while on vacation.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is quick and captures photos I would never have imagined from a phone. The future is here!

no,yes,yes,Takes better pics - only bad thing is the SIM card
yes,yes,yes,Everything I could ever want in a phone. I love everything about it.
yes,yes,yes,The camera on this phone is absolutely worth buying this phone. Add in beautiful design elements and it is the best phone you can buy right now!
no,yes,no,The phone is good but there are glitches still. When pressing any key repeatedly an orange box outlines the screen and the size increases. It gets all screwing and they can't fix it. It goes away when you go to the home screen but you might loose all your hard work.
yes,no,yes,I like most things on my galaxy S 6. What I do not like is ifit locks up. you cannot take the battery out.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is easy to use has greAt features. If you've had a previous version of galaxy you won't have any trouble. If this is your first you'll love it.
yes,yes,yes,I do love everything it does but I took the plunge and went from a dumb phone to this and I hate the fact that it is sooool huge it takes up my whole hand. I almost brought it back but this is the only bad thing I could find.
yes,yes,yes,"My favorite feature is the camera, better than my Nikon! I wish it had longer battery life, but it's adequate"
yes,yes,yes,I went from an iPhone 4 to this phone. At first it was nice because it was pretty sleek and the camera was great...but the more I use it the less impressed I'm becoming. The battery life is TERRIBLE.
yes,yes,yes,"I never thought I would like a large phone but I do, this phone has been my favorite phone and I have had several different ones. It is by far the nicest phone I have had and the camera is amazing."
yes,yes,yes,I love all the new apps and all you can do with the S6. I especially love the new camera features. i have a 2 month old and i am contantly taking pics of him and they turn out great. The only con is the bettery life.
yes,no,yes,"Phone is incredible. after 2 weeks still finding more cools uses and functions. battery life ok, killing the Iphone 6."
yes,yes,yes,"I love android OS and I love samsung quality. I have been using galaxy since 3Rd generation but the galaxy s6 gold is horrible, by far the worse smartphone that I have ever used, not only battery dies within 4 hrs of use, but it's constantly searching for signal in the same places and spots that I..."
yes,yes,yes,Coming off of IPhone finally I have control of apps that help me get through the day from fitness to productivity. You won't regret it .
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is great. The build quality, the display, the camera, and the speed are all fantastic. The only downside to this phone is the battery life. It drains quickly and I barely manage to squeeze an entire day out of it without charging the device."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is nearly as good as all of its advertising and hype -- it has beautiful design and screen resolution, a great camera, and works really fast. It takes a bit of getting used to to know how to use it best, (like not leaving it on auto brightness, which tends to drain the battery) but once..."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is easy to handle has awesome features I like the themes I can put on my phone I switched from above I phone and I definitely like this phone better
yes,yes,yes,"I've had this phone for about a month now, and I am loving it. I had an iPhone before, and the Galaxy S6 beats it in every aspect I can think of. I love the way all my apps are organized and being able to do everything though my google account is really convenient."
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone it has great features, the images on this phone is amazing no filter required at all. I find it easy to use."
yes,no,yes,I love this phone! So far it's better than any other phone I've had...the only thing that I do not like is that the battery life on it is not great
yes,yes,yes,Phone was very fast and very fun really like this phone is very easy to work
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love my new device. Having the ability to customize with different themes and ringtones is awesome. The only thing I don't like is the update to the calendar but I believe that is an Android update.
yes,yes,yes,This phone is much faster than my previous phone. It is SO nice to have quick response when using GPS on our vacation this week!
yes,yes,yes,It's light and simple. I love the features on it.. couldn't have gotten a better phone
yes,yes,yes,"So I've had the S6 for two weeks now. It is faster and has significantly better battery life than my old S4. With the Power Saving mode turned on, I'm getting almost 3 days out of my battery. Awesome! In addition, I was never able to get phone reception in my building at work, but now I do."
yes,yes,yes,I just switched from a iphone 5c to samsung galaxy s6 in gold and i couldn't be happier with it. It's so much more capable than the iphone and i really like how personalized it can be. My only complaint is it is super slippery.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has and does everything I want and more. The battery life isn't that great but turning off and clearing out apps helps alot.
no,yes,no,"I'm not sure what happened, but suddenly my apps aren't working anymore. I cannot get them to stay open. I often get the ""Unfortunately app has stopped,"" message. Facebook and Instagram often freeze and won't load the content."
yes,yes,yes,I like the phone because it is light and very big easy to hold but yet so hard to get it out of your hands.
yes,yes,no,"I personally have only 3 problems with my new Samsung S6. #1 being that my fat thumbs make it hard while texting, as I'm use to have a physcial keyboard when I had a Droid 4. #2 The S6 is still slow for me."
yes,yes,yes,I've had the S6 phone for about a month. I moved from a Droid Razor Maxx HD and this phone easily beats that phone by every measure. Great experience!
yes,yes,yes,"The phone is fine, don't use all the crazy features but the one thing it does do is get this orange boarder that increases the screen size and stops many functions. At first I thought it was the new swift keyboard which the tech had me uninstall which seemed to fix it but all is back again."
no,no,yes,I've only had the s6 for two weeks and I love it so much more than the s3. The biggest difference is the battery life. After 8 hours with the s3 I would be down to 33%. With the s6 I would come home from work and still have 75-80% battery life left.
yes,yes,yes,"I love my Galaxy S6. There are tons of reviews out there about how well, or not well a smart phone works. If you are a phone geek and really understand it wonderful, but I will dumb it down for those of you who aren't."
yes,yes,yes,I upgraded from an S3 and couldn't be happier. I was debating between a S5 and a S6 though the fact that I can get cases to help with the water resistance and was able to keep using all my same power cords with the mini USB won me over.
yes,yes,yes,This is the best phone I've owned so far! I would suggest it to anyone looking for a new phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Out of the phones I've used, this one is the best. The build quality is top notch. I feel like I am holding something valuable. The screen is also super vibrant and just the right size for easy one handed use. The camera is also something worthy of praise."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is very intuitive and anticipates the type of information I want to see, based on past history. The keyboard features are GREAT - no more shifting to get to numbers, for example."
yes,yes,yes,The screen on this phone is large enough that my over-40 eyes have no problem reading anything I bring up.The camera is better than any of my digital cameras. I just point and shoot and there's no blurr from a shaky hand.
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone...This is the best phone I have ever had. My son's coach loves it too! She said she is ready for a upgrade. I wouldn't change my phone to any phone. I want to keep this phone!
yes,yes,yes,Great look andown feel with a fast processer and a great camera and screen resolution.
yes,yes,yes,The S6 has a lot more customizable features in comparison to many of the previous galaxy devices. The camera quality is more defined & the double click of the home screen makes it quick & easy to capture moments as their occuring. I love this phone!
yes,yes,yes,I got this phone for about a month now and I am impressed. The features are very useful (unlike some useless things for decoration by other companies) and the design is absolutely gorgeous. The internet works very fast and the phone even has themes for you.
yes,yes,yes,"I love everything (almost) about my new S6. Camera is awesome, design is sleek, it's a beautiful thing. The thing that I don't like is that the back cover is not removable. If I want to replace the battery I can't. Other than that, highly recommended."
yes,yes,yes,"Not too many changes from my Samsung Galaxy S3 except for the camera, the more fluid user interface and the inclusion of Google apps."
yes,yes,yes,This is a great phone. The quality is exceptional. So many great features. The picture quality is amazing. I would highly recommend this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"I wish this phone had a better battery, it would be near perfect,"
yes,yes,yes,It's the best phone i ever had
yes,yes,yes,"The new Galaxy S6 has great features, specifically the camera; bright clear pictures. I love the ""speak"" to capture feature for the front and rear cameras. I also love the new text messages app; the cool animated icons you can insert into the text based on certain words that are typed."
yes,yes,yes,I absolutely love this phone! I recommend a case that is not slick. The phone is so slippery without one! I bought the gold platinum and loved the color so much I bought a clear case. It's perfect. It's easy to use for sure. The only thing I don't like is it's battery life.
yes,yes,yes,"I absolutely love this phone! My son said ""mom you should get an I-phone. I looked at him and laughed. I said no way, I love androids and I love my GS6! I loved that I could share my location with my boyfriend when I was on my way to meet him. That was pretty cool."
yes,yes,yes,"I love my new Samsung! Very easy to use. Beautiful to look at. Love the TV Remote App, and the Health app."
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone I've ever had. That may not seem as overwhelming an endorsement when one considers I've only owned two, but its quality and features are a major step up from my beloved Droid Bionic.It's sleeker, lighter and more attractive with an appearance worthy of..."
yes,yes,yes,I like it much better than the iPhone and I also love that I can download music easily on my phone.
yes,yes,yes,So far I love my new phone but I don't like that it's fully encased in glass....sure it looks nice but it makes it heavy & then requires a case which makes it even heavier & more bulky. Being fully encased in glass also means that the battery isn't removable & that is my biggest peeve.
yes,yes,yes,"Overall the phone is great. Battery life not overly good. If in standby not too bad, but if use very much will have to charge everyday, possibly more than once a day."
yes,yes,yes,"I've had my S6 for a few weeks now, and am finding that it is really an amazing phone from top to bottom.First, the overall beauty of phone. I was lucky enough to find a gold S6 locally and in my opinion it is the most beautiful color for this phone."
yes,no,yes,This device completely excelled my expectations. I upgraded from a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 to the Galaxy S6. I was worried that the size of the screen would be hard to get used to. I was pleasantly surprised that it is just the right size for my hands. The device is lightweight and sturdy.
yes,yes,yes,The s6 is awesome I love the camera the wide screen the gold color everything about the phone is nice including the wireless charging ( I have not got a wireless charging station yet)and turbo charge.
yes,yes,yes,Had a galaxy III which was great but this phone is fantastic! Seems to know what I want to do and makes easy to use. I am truly a Samsung fan.
yes,no,yes,I like the bigger display and the fact that it has an internal battery just wish it lasted a little longer.
yes,no,yes,Overall all the Samsung Galaxy S6 is an amazing phone tht anyone could use. The GALAXY S6 has shown IPhone users what a real premium smartphone feels like.
yes,yes,yes,The clarity of the screen is fantastic... like I got new prescription for my glasses. Had S3 and liked it but this has so much more! Definitely worth the switch.
yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy S6 is honestly the best phone out all the other galaxy and I phone at that. I love that I was able to put the lil outer space background, the built in memory storage is more than enough that you need for your phone,you go all the music you want play all the games you like on it won't slow..."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone has improved battery life over the Samsung Galaxy 4. I like the improved menus. I didn't buy it for the camera, however, I am extremely impressed with the camera features and picture quality. When my husband upgrades his phone, he will get the Samsung Galaxy 6 also."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is a lot of fun to use like watching, listen to music, etc. Also love the look of the galaxy s6 and the feel of it."
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone! I switched from an iPhone 6, which I absolutely hated. I love the updated look and the quality build of the phone. Combined with features that are actually usable means this phone is fantastic. The payment system I am excited for, and the customization is amazing."
yes,yes,yes,Product is great. Replacement unit was delivered in two days.
yes,yes,yes,The S6 was an upgrade for me from the S3 & this far I've been highly impressed with this phone. It processes apps quickly and has great features that I use daily.
yes,no,yes,Moved to the new Samsung Galaxy s6 from galaxy s3. Love the screen size & the fast charge in the new phone.
yes,yes,yes,This is the 3rd cell phone I've owned and I cannot believe the difference! This phone is fast and the screen is big enough for my eyes (no straining). It is also very sleek; I love the look of it! I think I may be a Samsung customer from now on.
yes,yes,yes,"Still learning the phone, but so far so good. I love the clarity and color. Love that I can get different covers for it. ""Important"" LOL! It's easy to use!"
yes,yes,yes,I had a Samsung Galaxy S4 and I upgraded to a Samsung Galaxy S6 and I love it! Everything about this phone is great. There's so many things you can do with it and the camera's quality is awesome!
yes,yes,yes,"With such a blazing fast cpu and the best camera on the market, one has to wonder if this phone design was actually sent back from the future ;-) . The screen is so crisp and vibrant that you know it's well beyond the current state of the art."
no,yes,yes,I have had my phone for 2 weeks and not happy with the external part of the phone. It has Gorilla Glass on both the front and back. I did NOT drop my phone but just set it down on the counter. The back Gorilla Glass cracked out of no where.
yes,yes,yes,I love LOVE LOVEEEE everything... except for the battery life. Before this I had a note 2 and the battery life was amazing - the s6 just does not live up to it.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone! Much better than my old one .Three of my family have the Samsung Galaxy 4. They really enjoy them and never had any problems.
yes,yes,yes,Catches memories beautifully love multitask functions!
yes,yes,yes,I love my phone and I also bought a Samsung tablet. Great products.
yes,no,yes,Not only do I love the color but the functions on it is amazing. It glides better than my old device that I had and I'm glad that I don't have to enter in a password every time and I can just use my finger print.
yes,yes,yes,Phone hardly ever stays in 4g!
yes,yes,yes,"First thing is first, I LOVE my photos. At first I couldn't figure out how to get them on my computer and it was making me very angry (thank God for my amazing boyfriend) he figured out airdroid and now it is super easy. Once I got that figured out my issues were over. This phone is great!"
yes,yes,yes,I like this new phone. The battery last longer and camera is great nice photos very clear
yes,yes,yes,"I Love this phone..I am still learning alot of my new features but the graphics, the battery life and design are awesome...Way to Go Samsung"
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone itself. But was so disappointed when I got it home and it cut out and could not get a good signal. I thought I had the best phone and the best service (Verizon) After leaving Straight Talk but had to return the phone for a Droid because it has a better antenna in it. Really Samsung?
yes,yes,yes,I love my galaxy s6! Its got awsome new features and takes amazing pics
yes,yes,yes,I love the S6. I had an S4 and the upgrade is phenominal. The size of the phone and the screen is excellent. I would rate the ease of use at a10. Thank you Samsung.
yes,yes,yes,"I have had my Galaxy S6 for 2 weeks now and I am LOVING it. The camera is even better than my previous phone (Galaxy S4). I am having fun with the intuitive messaging and the imogis is recommends. I also love the sHealth app, can't believe they put a heart rate sensor in the phone, very cool."
yes,yes,yes,"My Samsung Galaxy S6 is really awesome. I love the features, too many to name. It's also designed pretty well, fairly light, not to big and obnoxious, definitely like that. Thanks for making a great product."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone! It has great features! I'm still discovering new ones every day :-)
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is simply amazing! I had a Samsung S-4 before but the S-6 is very different. The voice control is nothing short of amazing. There are so many things that you can do with just your voice like....... Call someone,........ search the internet...........take notes.........."
yes,yes,yes,Ver y good Just obesidad thing i don t like is not water resisten
yes,yes,yes,"I love this phone. It is fast, sleek and stylish. I would recommend it to anyone that asks."
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone! Beautiful pics, easy to use, not to big, just perfect (-:"
yes,yes,yes,"I love everything about Samsung products. My new galaxy s6 is amazing. My only problem is that I'm not able to set a personalized ringer for text as I did on my gs4. Love the design, rapid charging, camera function s, and bright display with customizable themes."
yes,yes,yes,its very amazingly fast way better than a iphone 6
yes,yes,yes,The phone runs really well and yhe battery lasts a lot longer than my s3's. I'm a bit disappointed since they took away the waterproof feature but other than that its great. Since it comes with its own themes i don't need to download another app.
yes,yes,yes,i luv the phones built quality...its very fast and has a great camera...luv the new fingerprint security settings..its a great phone for the value..battery life is best yet..its worth the upgrade...
yes,yes,yes,"So far my experience with the Samsung Galaxy S6 has been outstanding! Split screen, is how can I say this? ""AWESOME !"" I've been recommending it to everyone."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome! The battery life is great, the performance is fast. Multiple tasks can be processing at once without any delays. The screen is super clear and defined which is great for taking pictures. Very reliable, worth every penny!!"
yes,yes,yes,I traded in my old iPhone 4 for the S4. I love it. The advance over the 4 is amazing.
yes,yes,yes,As a dedicated follower of another major manufacturer I was somewhat sceptical of switching not just to another device but another OS as well. The overall experience of the S6 has actually turned me into a convert. The phone has exceeded expectations on most fronts.
yes,yes,yes,I made a mistake by reviewing the edge version instead of this one. This is a great phone. I'm sure the edge is also. You can read my review for this phone by looking at the edge. Same Review Title. Sorry Samsung.
yes,no,yes,If I wanted a lame phone with no option to replace its battery I'd buy an iPhone. It also doesn't give you the option of adding memory. Samsung basically got rid of the only best things that set them above the iPhone.
no,no,no,"Received cellphone november 2, worked find for 3 weeks, then the camera bugged and wont make focus anymore. I tried everything to fix it. I cannot take any picture anymore. Then I asked Cosmos Planet for replacement or help."
yes,yes,yes,"So far so good the phone has been great. Nicely built phone. The battery is very good for me as I am not a heavy texter nor do I spend a lot of time watching videos. I like the size of the screen. I have had 5.5"" and 5.7"" screens on previous phones and found those phones too big."
yes,no,yes,Mobile is good but i didnt receive screen protector and case cover in box .. front camera is just fine ...
yes,yes,yes,still waiting for the free wireless charger..
yes,yes,yes,Bought this phone a year back when the price was still close to 40 k . After one year of usage below are my experiences -camera :excellent camera both front and back . The front camera also has a wide angle meaning you can take a groupie with less effort.
yes,yes,yes,Love it. Been three months.but no noticeable slowing or battery deterioration so far.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung Galaxy S6 edge Pros: 1. Design 2. Camera 3. Screen 4. Earphone 5. Speaker 6. Call quality 7. S health Cons: 1. Battery backup
yes,yes,yes,It's a really good smartphone coz it have many features like superbly camera front and back both with superb video capture and one thing........very powerful if you dont believe me so please check antutu benchmark and geekhbech score with compare other smartphone.
yes,yes,yes,Nice ..... Network is fast .great looking Y I gave 4 star nt 5 bcoz nt having memory slot But over all the best mobile in market ... Thank u samsung and porrvikar
no,yes,no,"It was working fine, till my phone did an automatic firmware and my phone completely crashed!! I have hardly had the phone for a few months and now need to take it to the repair shop. Reflects very poorly on Samsung!!"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is really attractive!! Good looking,very slim,and well built!! Camera is awesome!! Good features as well!! But as the samsung legacy continues this phone still runs on touchwiz and it still eats a lot of ram and makes the phone slow!! And it hangs!! Wish it didn't hang!!"
no,no,no,This phone is not working with overseas SIM. Surprise to see this. All the phone i purchase in US and UK work across the world then why not Indian products. I have to return this adorable and intelligent phone due to this as I am a frequent flyer.
no,no,no,Very Very Poor Mobile. Getting too much of Heat and Battery Draining Fast.
yes,no,yes,Supperb phone in everything... But there is only one problem which is its battery backup but even that it is supper...
yes,yes,yes,Is wireless charger available with this mobile?
yes,yes,yes,"Best in class ,go for it !! Best camera best mode of camera slow motion fast motion , Smart selfie senser,finger print senser is very good, 3gb ram"
yes,yes,yes,Been using the phone now for the last one month. Samsung this time has created a really beautifully crafted phone which carries a unique design language. It is really a joy to hold the phone and use it. The camera preforms marvellously and I've been able to take some really nice snaps.
yes,yes,yes,This review is based on 1 month of usage. Let me tell you the pros of this device. First of all it's really an excellent smartphone although the price is a bit high. The build quality is very good and gives a premium look. It comes with 1440p QHD Super AMOLED display.
yes,yes,yes,"It's just been a day after I received the phone and I am excited to write this review. The phone is fantabolous, the best part of which is its camera. Screen is very good but using it in full brightness, where its essence is felt, drains the battery. Features are to notch."
yes,yes,yes,"Great Phone, Samsung really nailed it after s5, I have been using s4 for 2.5 years and badly in need of upgrade, was skeptical initially to go for this due to samsung bloatware on earlier models, but s6 is awesome Pros: surprisingly fast (Though RAM is 85% occupied always) sleek with premium..."
yes,yes,yes,"Was a little sceptical about buying a phone online. However, the price was considerably less than what I was getting in retail stores. Been using for a little more than a month now. No issues thus far. Phone is fast, great features and battery lasts a good day for me."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone & equally great specs. Pros - The Gold version feels premium in your hands. Screen display is sharp and crisp - though not very clear in bright sun. Photos are very good and crisp - haven't tried the low light ones yet.
yes,yes,yes,As expected its a nice cell phone. But the new feature of Fingerprint reading is not effective. Most of the time it doesn't read correctly and I have to feed the back up password.I sign in the Biometric device in my office every morning and that works fine every single time.Why could't Samsung make...
yes,yes,yes,Good phone even for hard user....
yes,yes,yes,Good product must buy at lowest price I bought galaxy s6 64gb at just 36900 INR Only Good deal and also product is brand new untouched
yes,no,yes,GHAR KI DUKAN HAI - YEH SAHI HAI GOOD FACILITY FULFILL COMMITMENT
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone, got as expected. Thank you"
yes,yes,yes,Good phone. Samsung could've avoided too much of bloatware though
yes,yes,yes,Order arrived well before time and was updated continuously about the status
yes,yes,yes,Excellent Phone. Delivered well before the promised date. Amazing experience!
no,no,yes,I received the phone within 3 days I placed the order
yes,yes,yes,"Awesome phone... great look great feel great flaunt and great performance as well but have given 4 star because of the battery, not a great one"
yes,yes,yes,I am very happy with the overall performance of the S6. I love the camera for its high-quality images.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone that has beaten Apple IPhone! Was hard to believe but after a month,I totally understand why it's been said so! It's unlike the stereotype Samsung phones that's gonna bore you after sometime. It's totally premium and the gold platinum model is better than any other phone in its class."
yes,yes,yes,Mast h phone le lo jiisne bhi lena i don't think there is any better offer than this phone @_@
no,yes,no,Please arrange to get the mobile returned as the battery discharges hardly in half an hour to 15 % even if it is charged 100 %. Also the phone remains very heated that it cant be kept in the pocket.
no,yes,no,"Its hard to believe, for just after 3 months of use gorilla glass is leaving its base.A very bad quality for such price, Apple is worth then Samsung"
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone! Every thing of this gem is superb, u can,t find any fault expect no memory card. Brilliant display beats iPhones , touch is butter smooth, nice very beautiful build and the gold colour set have a look of Bollywood heroine,yes very gorgeous!"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product with India Warranty.
yes,yes,yes,Great phone with all advanced technological features with premium lookso!!
yes,yes,yes,I have been using this phone form past 6 months and it works as good as new. Totally love it!!!!!!!!!!
no,no,yes,"Hi. This is Amit. There is a good news for u all.. Reliance jio is offering free Sim cards which is a ""Jio Preview Offer"" with complimentary UNLIMITED access to Digital Life for 90 days which includes High Definition Voice, Make audio and video conference calls, send and receive Sms, chat and share..."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent......using since last 400 days Perfect Loved it !!!
yes,yes,yes,Perfect phone..only lacks in battery which is 2550 mAH. Otherwise overall amazing and excellent phone. Using for almost a year..
no,yes,yes,I bought the phone for my mother and wasn't completely satisfied. The battery is not that good. The phone was going on mute very often when ahe used to talk. The charger port malfunctioned withing 3 months of use.
yes,yes,yes,"Best mobile right now, but battery is average"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone from Samsung!! No lag yet!!!!!!!!!
yes,yes,yes,"Great look. Loved the color and sleeky design. Got it delivered few hours back, hopefully can give a detailed feedback soon :)"
yes,yes,yes,A great phone . moves around flawlessly and has an excellent camera as well.
yes,no,yes,Excellent Phone very smooth touches nice clarity and very battery back up is good
yes,yes,yes,"Writing the review after using iphone6. Phone has a lot more features when compared to the iphone6. The camera is far better. The screen is more vibrant. The design is also beautiful but so is that of the iPhone 6. Phone is fast, allows one to use multiple screens."
yes,yes,yes,Shifted from Apple. And I'm lOving the phone. From its camera to fast charge. It's just a very wellong built and designed phone.
no,no,no,defective product sold by seller ezeekart. phone started over heating on charging and did not switch on even once after receiving. very poor experience considering the premium price of the phone.
yes,yes,no,In short. Poor battery. Best camera out there at the moment. Insane display. And we all know how we feel about Touchwiz. I've personally never come across a Touchwiz fan. I don't know why Samsung continues to invest its resources on it.
yes,yes,yes,"Better than iPhone 6 in every aspect for this price. If touchwiz is a factor , you can always flash a custom ROM to make it run even smoother than iPhone 6."
yes,yes,yes,Everything was exactly as they said. I have had no problems with it whatsoever.
no,yes,yes,"I get lots of unwanted pop-ups . Like if I try to go YouTube, I get redirected to some other site telling me to download something. Very annoying."
yes,yes,yes,"Oh my gosh!! The s6 was the perfect gift to give for the 4th of July!! My mother loved it!! If you are considering, you should definitely do it!! If this helped you, please rate rate! :)"
yes,yes,yes,My husband loves those
no,yes,yes,"samsung would not register the phone and blue tooth is poor. l have a s5 and it is a nice phone, just save your money."
yes,yes,yes,"Got in time. So far working great. It comes with a headphone, a sim extracting pin, and a regular wired charger. It does not come with a charging base, which needs to be bought separately."
yes,yes,yes,"The screen is non-responsive at its edges, especially the top edge to drag down the settings quick menu. Absolutely unaccceptable flaw for a $500+ cellphone, and Samsung's flagship."
no,no,yes,"I've had a number of problems with the phone, I sent am email to the company and received no reply. The older Samsung Galaxy phones were so much better!"
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is awesome! As far as I can tell it works just fine. I had ordered one before just like it, but sent it back because some of the letters on the keyboard didn't respond when you pushed them. Return was super easy, and now I have this one, and I love it!"
yes,yes,yes,"I guess my only complaint so far is the battery life, hopefully Android 6.0 will improve it a bit. Overall great phone!"
yes,yes,yes,This is an amazing phone the only thing is the icons and keyboard is a lititle old fashioned but other wiseit's amazing
yes,yes,yes,"Love the phone, but knocked a star off for not being waterproof. That would have been a killer feature and why Samsung went backwards on this is beyond me."
yes,yes,yes,"Haven't been able to use ir yet, as I'm waiting for the sim card, but its original as I coud see, which is the most important thing. Bought it for my husband, I already have the s6 edge and I love it so, I guess it'll be much like that.the only bad thing it has, is the battery, it doesn't last long,..."
no,yes,yes,nine months using it's already doesn't working
yes,yes,yes,No words! This phone is amazing.
yes,yes,yes,I like the phone so far but wifi calling is no where to be found in my settings
no,no,no,"BEWARE this is an internatonal phone. It was not indicated on the description. Now that I am having problems, after less than a year I cannot contact my service provider of Samsung US for assistance and DO NOT know where this phone can be registered!!!"
no,no,no,"I bought this phone in October and now it no longer recognize the SIM card ... I thought it was because I went card and T-Mobile and they have given me a new card, but it seems that the problem is the phone. From Settings vanished everything related to mobile networks."
yes,yes,yes,"This was a gift for my mother and she absolutley loved the phone because it looks beautiful, the screen size isnt obsesively big like most phablets today and it takes amazing pictures. Makes an awesome gift."
yes,yes,yes,"I got my phone within the 2 days they promised. It is everything they described. Nice phone, however I had to get used to the programs. My camera did not have any modes other than panorama or auto."
yes,yes,yes,Whatta bargain and is a great phone.
yes,yes,yes,Very good qaulity phone.
yes,yes,yes,This is great everything is as stated no problems !
no,no,no,Horrible phone screen stopped working within days
no,no,no,"I bought a samsung phone a year ago, quite expensive. It doesn't work well now. It's so slow and nothing downloads on it. My other devices work perfectly on the wifi. I will never buy anything from this buyer. 'BAD EXPERIENCE'"
no,yes,no,Like this so far. Not anymore. Defective. Hangs. Drop calls. Losses internet. I thought the problem was the provider but change provider ever since and still the same.
yes,yes,yes,I loved this phone
yes,yes,yes,Excellent camera (main purchase reason). Easy to use interface. Long battery life. Who could ask for more?
yes,yes,yes,Received my phone with no issues. It works wonderfully! I went to my local ATT store and set it up with no problems. This was a great buy and I love the color!
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product
yes,yes,yes,Works perfectly.
yes,yes,yes,Bought it as a present for my uncle and he loves it. Thank You.
yes,yes,yes,Okay so my girlfriend and i decided to go in on a phone plan together.. and i had a choice between this phone and the lg g4.. First off i im not a fan of phones with removable batteries. So this phone was the easy choice and i can confidently say that im not looking back..
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. Nice upgrade to the s4 I had before. I'm glad I waited for this phone instead of the s5. My girlfriend has s5 and this phone has more features and feels sturdy with metal materials
yes,yes,yes,"Let me just say that this buy was absolutely amazing! It arrived when it said, the phone is beautiful, and brand new! I'm more than happy with this purchase."
yes,yes,yes,"Until today, after a month, it works perfect"
yes,yes,yes,very happy with my Samsung Galaxy S6 phone.
yes,yes,yes,"My S3 started acting ginky and, after three years, it was time to move on. Since I travel abroad regularly, I wanted a phone that would take foreign SIMs. But mostly, I wanted a phone that won't freeze on me. This one fits the bill perfectly."
yes,yes,yes,"I really can't see the everyday benefits to using this phone over another. I'd recommend a BLU Studio 5, LG V 10 or other LG. I've used the 3, 4, and 5 from friends and my own order and I always have issues or parts issues."
yes,no,yes,Love it!!! All I had to do way buy a new SIM card and I was ready to go.☺
yes,yes,yes,good product at a great price
no,yes,no,Not working on roaming
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. I like it :)
no,no,no,"I loved my Galaxy S3 - but the charging mechanism on it had to be replaced twice. So I thought instead of replacing it again, I would get this phone. I've had it for less than a month and the LCD screen stopped working (I didn't get it wet or drop it)."
no,yes,no,"I'm putting 5 stars for the phone itself, however, I had to return this phone and buy it from my carrier instead. When I did the math it was cheaper to buy this phone from here instead of my carrier."
no,yes,no,i give this a 3 star for the reason we pay over $450 for the phone and it comes without a sdcard so basically the phone is useless until we buy a card for the phone. So what if i sold you a car and you paid $ thousand's for it but when it arrived i left the engine out of it?
no,yes,yes,The Phone has a few lines That appears and disappears on the display. You can ser ir on numero 2
yes,yes,yes,Works perfectly fine in Venezuela
yes,yes,yes,Everything okay with it
yes,yes,yes,"So far I love the phone, but will not comment about it specifically. I just want to share about my experience, as before buying I've read reviews about ""opened boxes"", ""broken seals"" and ""spanish versions"". I was a bit worried when ordering but gave it a try, and I'm glad I did."
no,no,no,"I was upset to find out that I have to run it for 5 minutes or so in the US with an American SIM card before it'll work internationally! It didn't say so before I ordered it! Now I have to send it back to the US with some, to run it for a bit and THEN return it to me in Europe. What a pain!"
yes,yes,yes,It's great better pictures more memory I love it is awesome
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone!! I has everything I need, takes great pictures and almost every app wanted is available. Was super easy to set up and install wanted programs."
yes,yes,yes,Too small for my sim card no memory chip slot
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone. It is awesome. I just love it
yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S6 is an excellent product that will leave you satisfied. It is an excellent phone in the never ending war between Apple and Samsung. It is an ideal product for anyone who is in the smartphone market and is looking for a reliable device that will exceed expectations.
yes,yes,yes,"Make the Switch The Galaxy S6 was my first smartphone that was not an iPhone, and I couldn’t be happier with it. If you were like me and having problems with your old phone, or your just looking for a better all-around phone then you should definitely switch to the Galaxy S6."
no,no,no,There might be a problem in the battery. It charges very slow and go down very fast even I don't use it strongly.
yes,yes,yes,"Thank you for the phone, I payed $ 49 to unlock the phone. But still great phone"
yes,yes,yes,From office use to entertainment.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone. It worked right out of the box with my T-Mobile sim.
yes,yes,yes,great phone! said it was compatible with straight talk but its not!
yes,yes,yes,Just set up phone yesterday so not alot of usage yet. Screen looks more vibrant than the prev S3. Like what I see so far.
no,no,no,It freezes and erases my contacts i check on line and found out these models do this all the time
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. Love the Samsung's UI which is so much nicer than the stock Android. Singed up for H2O wireless with no problems.
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone. Just sad they no longer have SD slots.
yes,yes,yes,"It is unlocked and in seems genuine. There are slight differences that are of no consequence. (slightly blue tint in the casing in direct light and no ""GALAXY S6"" written on the back. I'm assuming because of the international model. But a very good phone."
yes,yes,yes,I brought the Samsung Galaxy for my sister. She is loving her phone.
no,yes,yes,"Got 920F instead of I, the KNOX is tripped, Vietnamese is the default language, no US charger. No, thank you!"
yes,yes,yes,"IN LOVE! This is the first time I have bought myself an actual nice smartphone. I usually get those that are under $200. I LOVE this phone. It was packaged great, everything works great!"
yes,yes,yes,"No problems here , just one happy fiancè"
no,yes,yes,everythin was perfect (sorry for my English) I already activate it.
yes,yes,yes,Inprove the expectationts Excelent camera
yes,yes,yes,Best phone and camera I have ever owned!
yes,yes,yes,This phone was perfect for my intended StraightTalk use. I only had to buy a nano SIM from StraightTalk to activate it. Couldn't be more happy.
yes,yes,yes,Im soo glad that my phone is actually new. I was prepared to send it back if it wasn't new. Thank God i didn't have to.
yes,yes,yes,"the clear case protects my S6 from scratches and ect, while still letting it show its white color =)"
yes,yes,yes,Love the phone and arrived quicker than I thought.
no,yes,no,No international warranty and now it's doesn't work. No more Samsung.
no,no,yes,I am very disappointed with this phone. The battery is very weak...wont hold a charge for a decent period of time. It is loaded with too much Samsung bloat ware. I made a mistake buying this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"great phone, works on cricket"
no,yes,no,"I am very disappointed at how it turned out to work. It is a nice phone, personally i think it was over priced but i bought it anyway. It worked okay for just a week; brand spanking new phone so i am not sure how this can happen. it heats up for no reason, freezes up where you cant even turn it off."
no,no,yes,This is shahana hashem.Something wrong with my phone.I need to change my phone
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone it's as fast and snappy as a phone can get. The battery life is not the best but is not bad at all. TouchWiz is much better in this generation and if you don't like how it looks you can change it all with a theme.
yes,yes,yes,I've been using it for one month already and great so far
yes,yes,yes,Love it thank you so much. My daughter has her own phone back
yes,yes,yes,My first generation smart phone died and I have always admired other people's samsungs so I bought this one. I can only say that it is amazing.
no,no,no,"The phone and some features work well, HOWEVER, it won't stay connected to a carrier and disconnects all of the time. Don't waste your money on this phone not worth it"
yes,yes,yes,Nice upgrade from my s3. Using with Straight Talk so far works as expected.
no,no,no,i was very disappointed. twice the same day the phone turn off by itself also there was a purple light flashing the whole time. i missed so any calls. the device was defective i had to send it back.
yes,yes,yes,Very nice phone. Failed to work with fingerprint and Samsung Pay. Works very good on everything else.
yes,yes,yes,Bought 1 for my wife...we're both happy
yes,yes,yes,The product was received in great condition and works fine.
yes,yes,yes,Very happy with my perches
yes,yes,yes,Nice and beautiful phone. Very useful!
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone it came on time and works great!
yes,yes,yes,It was a gift for my girl. she is happy and loves it. Loves the color.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone but it gets very hot when i use the LTE Network, but when im on wifi its fine. I don't think a brand new phone would be having these issues."
yes,yes,yes,Got this for my fiance as a gift and he absolutely LOVES it!! We had no problems putting on our T-Mobile account! Works great!
yes,yes,yes,So far so good. Great phone good price
no,yes,yes,"So the phone itself is good, and the camera is excellent. However, some of the posts about carrier support can be misleading. The support of T-Mobile is missing a couple of bands which leads to spotty coverage on Edge and 3G coverage areas."
no,yes,no,"cannot use this phone in china, you have to pay extra money to unlock this phone.,..."
no,yes,no,"I don't know if I just so happened to get a bad device, but this phone is the worst I have ever owned. It freezes constantly throughout the day, sometimes for days at a time. It is very frustrating to have a smartphone and it not work."
no,yes,yes,This was a great phone but was programmed in Spanish ... had to be returned for that reason. Someone dropped the ball by not checking before shipping to customer needing English programmed device. (Very disappointing)
yes,yes,yes,"beatiful, work great. fast, especially the camera. so many camera function that u never find in any Iphone. I love the surround shot, live broadcast, wide angle selfie. awesome smartphone"
no,no,no,4 months old and the return button stopped working. Samsung your phones are junk have to send in for warranty and wait for response Build it fast who cares if it last
no,yes,yes,"I love the phone, but unfortunately, I had to return it because it wouldn't work on the T-Mobile network. T-Mobile is doing this obnoxious tihng where you now have to buy the T-Mobile ONLY phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Extremely happy with my new phone, has everything that I was looking for and boy is it fast"
no,yes,yes,"It's a bit slow, which is disappointing because it obviously didn't cost 100 bucks. Speaker isn't great either. Very pretty overall, but that's it."
yes,yes,yes,"If you wanted a gold galaxy s6, this is the perfect one. There's no other better."
yes,yes,yes,"I am very happy with this phone. The price was great, too!"

yes,yes,yes,love it much better than my old iphone!
yes,yes,yes,Excelent. I recomend.
yes,yes,yes,"The galaxy S6 phone is very good but there's one thing that really disappoints me. Sometimes the battery does not fully charge and I really don't know why. Also, I think that the price is higher than it should be."
yes,yes,yes,"No problems, just what I was looking for. Great size, shape and overall feel in the hand. Just like an iPhone but better. Recommend getting the cordless charging station - it makes charging so easy and also helps me keep track of the phone so I dont leave it around the house and lose it."
yes,yes,yes,"I am in love with my new phone. The color is super cool, very unique and interesting. My husband has Edge S6 in dark blue color and even thou this one is S6, I like it more than his."
no,yes,no,Problem with the mic people I call won't hear me till after a couple seconds
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product and service

yes,yes,yes,The Samsung Galaxy S6 is an incredible android phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Very happy with my Galaxy S-6. Its features even impressed a friend who is a devoted I-phone user. She particularly liked the ease of accessing Google from the home screen, and the directions on google maps. Photo quality is a big improvement from my Galaxy S-3. Love the vibrant color of the phone."
yes,yes,yes,"I have always been an iPhone user and decided to try out Samsung. The phone is fast, storage is good, photos are great, overall the phone works really well. The downside, I always have to put the phone in battery saving mode otherwise battery will only last a short period of time and by short I mean..."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone I love it
yes,yes,yes,"Love this phone, was not disappointed, easy to used. Would recommend!!"
yes,yes,yes,Yes I love Samsung Galaxy 6 it great
yes,yes,yes,Everything cool! Thanks very much!
yes,yes,yes,EXCELLENT PRODUCT AND SERVICE.
yes,yes,yes,I like the phone a lot. Good camera. Plenty of memory. I think it's the ideal size for a smartphone. Good size for games and reading. It seems a little fragile so I would definitely recommend a case of some sort.
no,yes,yes,Does not meet specifications for straight take to activate phone or att
yes,yes,yes,"Both phones are working excellent. At the beginning we were a bit concerned of buying two phones that were supposed to be used in Argentina, buy now I will change them again in the same way we did it thid time"
no,no,no,I think was gres but only one week and the Phone turn off by itself and frezze
yes,yes,yes,"I have been using it for less than a week and so far I wasn't able to use many of its features. However, one day after it arrived I traveled, and I LOVE the camera! The photos I took are really nice. It really surprised me, even the photos I took against the sunlight were good!"
yes,yes,yes,great phone I love it
yes,yes,yes,"I've dropped my S5 in the hot tub a number of times, and love the fact that I don't need a bulky case to water proof it. Function over Form comparing the S6."
yes,yes,yes,I'm really happy with your product. thank You :)
no,yes,yes,"Get this phone if you care about the quality of your photos. The camera is absolutely ON POINT. The pictures it takes looks better than it actually does in real life..no joke. The detail is crazy, even in low light environments.."

yes,yes,yes,"I only owned the phone for a few days, and I like it very much so far. The screen is awesome, very bright and sharp. It makes great pictures, although I was surprised to find out that you do not need to unlock the phone to take pictures. I see possibility of pranks and unauthorized picture taking."
no,no,no,"Has no SIM setting, I cannot find any signal."
no,yes,yes,So happy with my purchase ! Have been getting familiar with phone all day and i dont want to put it down. Just received yesterday. Very thrilled with purchase.
no,no,no,"Not a bad product but I prefer my Unlocked Galaxy S5. The upgrades don't over shadow the S5 in anyway. Also its a Droids version of an I phone, no external memory (You can't add a chip IOT save songs or more pictures...)."
yes,yes,yes,"Is a good cell phone, really powerfull and beauty ;)"
yes,yes,yes,Product is excellent☺☺☺☺

no,no,no,"Particular version (international) has a problem with software update. As I understand, there is no warranty as well. When you trying to update os software at google it says : this phone software has been unauthorized modified. Who knows who modified it and what I have there now."
yes,yes,yes,"So far as my first cell phone, I am impressed with it, but I am still learning how to use it. One thing however, it does seem to discharge the battery when it is on for extended periods of time. This may very well be normal, as I am an inexperienced user."
yes,yes,yes,It is one of the things that I want to buy
yes,yes,yes,I am very happy with my s6
yes,yes,yes,Worth buying. Special design. The 577 pixels per inches is pixel density results in a screen with crisp displays and super sharp and smooth images.
yes,yes,yes,A different feeling.
yes,yes,yes,Surprised at the great price.
yes,yes,yes,I love these. It is so beautiful .
yes,yes,yes,"Hands down a great phone all issues fix from s5. Such as finger print scanner ( no more swiping), battery life is way better, Screen quality is also improved it also feature an ir blaster. Model sm-G920I is not compatible with Samsung pay but it not a big deal android pay works just fine."
yes,yes,yes,I love this phone. It came in the mail very quickly. And it's really easy to use. I got it in white.
yes,yes,yes,"Samsung 6s phone is great. Love, love, love it."
no,no,no,Horrible . Read all the reviews this is not a real Samsung it's made overseas and mine broke 3 weeks after I bought it.
yes,yes,yes,"Im still figuring out if i like or not this phone. The gold color is really nice, it works well and most important IT WORKS IN ARGENTINA! but coming from LG I feel pretty unconfortable with some features, but its a matter of time I guess. Nice phone, works well."
yes,yes,yes,Exceeded expectations. A great buy. OUR SECOND PURCHASE WITH the SAME SAMSUNG quality.
yes,yes,yes,"I notice that the camara of my phone isn't great, I compared it to the S6 edge and S5 and the two are better than my S6. I do not like it at all. Also when I changed the language to spanish the ""Tools"" icon remained in english, and doesn't change to ""Herramientas"" as they say in Spanish."
yes,yes,yes,"amazing phone, came from a bb q10 and I am loving it"
yes,yes,yes,Nice phone and I would recommend to buy. Has advanced features. I like this phone.
yes,yes,yes,Slim phone and have Good primary camera.
yes,yes,yes,Phone is pretty light weight esp compared to my last windows phone which was cumbersome to haul around. Battery needs recharging about every other day. Sharp camera. This was my first Samsung so had to ask another user re retrieving voice mail & recording and sending videos but this is a great...
yes,yes,yes,"Have been burned before with another company on a different phone. Had to send back. Not this one. Great phone, great price, Great fast service."
yes,yes,yes,I had no problem using this in a U.S. Territory. It is what it is. The phone is of great quality. The phone came with S6 packaging with the white box and all accessories included. The S6 has not given me any difficulties.
no,yes,yes,battery is being heated and discharging very soon while speaking. I'm not satisfied with the product. Now I'm afraid to buy this kind of products.
no,no,no,"This is unfortunately a pretty bad phone. I got it two months ago to replace a nexus 5, and i've been very underwhelmed. It's loaded with samsung bloatware, and the general performance is terrible. There's very noticeable lag when doing anything, and event typing is slow."
yes,yes,yes,love it! great buying experience....
no,yes,no,the charger malfunctions or the battery does not work well
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing cellphone, it is a 6 stars in every aspect."
yes,no,yes,"I have never purchased an unlocked phone and I was very skeptical. The phone arrived a little ahead of schedule. The box, packaging and items inside were intact I wanted to use this phone on StraightTalk."
yes,yes,yes,"Nice Phone. Looks completely new. Came with charger, earphones, and screen protecter. Very satisfied."
yes,yes,yes,Really like this cellphone. The screen is brilliant and this phone is probably the fastest android phone I have ever used. The fast charge feature really works. I haven't measured it but it gets to a full charge very quickly. The downside? Battery life stinks.
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this phone in November 8, 2015, but I have been having problems with my carrier because it wants a receipt where I support the imei I have, I need help with this, it it possible? my cellphone works perfectly I do not have any problem with it but I need that information quickly, thank you."
yes,yes,yes,Great buy. Item as described.
no,yes,yes,Phone was able to connect to T mobile fine and gets 4g lte. Needs a nano sim card to connect.
yes,yes,yes,"Wow, what a difference a year makes. While last year's S5 took many steps in the right direction(being somewhat waterproof with better material and craftsmanship), it still wasn't there to make it a mouth-watering phone yet, like what HTC did when they first introduced their One M7, or whenever..."
yes,yes,yes,Best phone i ever purchased. Worth every penny.
yes,yes,yes,The best cellphone
no,yes,yes,Nice phone. I just couldn't get a reliable signal since it was an international version. Pointless to have a phone I can not use. Also theread we're times when the phone would get hot when charging it. I used to charger that came with the phone. The finger print scanner is all that great either.
yes,yes,yes,best phone i ever had...calls are clear...speaker sounds loud...display is great...camera is awesome..phone is stylish and light weight
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. I liike it.
yes,yes,yes,Very nice smart phone. Easy to use and works flawlessly.
yes,yes,yes,"fast, comfortable, beautiful"
yes,yes,yes,It is very nice it running slow
yes,yes,yes,I am somewhat happy with the phone except it won't pick up LTE and the Galaxy 6 is LTE capable.
no,yes,no,"I got the Galaxy S6 activated on 11/30 and it died on 12/3. Samsung offered to send me a mailing label so I could send it in for repairs. Totally unacceptable! It will be at least 4 days to get a label and then more mailing time, and then wait their 10 days for repair, and then more mailing time."
no,yes,no,"it got so hot and the screen will not rotate. had to return it. nice phone though, put all the blame to Samsung for dont know how to fix their own problem."
yes,yes,yes,This product got at my house one day before it was suppose to. The phone works really good and it's beautiful to.
no,yes,no,"Ever since I received this phone, I've encountered many problems even after I've had a new one sent to me."

yes,yes,yes,10 puntos excelente!
yes,yes,yes,"excellent product, guarantee the jente, they are very fast and powerful, and work great"
yes,yes,yes,I am in love with this phone so many fun features
yes,yes,yes,Best phone my wife has had to date.
no,no,no,It doesn't work out of network
no,no,no,This phone does not work when u put on speaker when u talking on the phone
no,yes,no,Exactly two months after my purchase the sim card reader stops working. I took it in to see if it was the sim card and it was not. Very disappointed as I thought I was going to get a quality phone.
no,yes,no,"Had the phone for 3 months and randomly the screen went black. Everything seems to function normally except the screen. Tried everything. Nothing works. Overall, very angry and regretting not getting a warranty."
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone......Thank you!
yes,yes,yes,I bought it for my mom who lives in Europe. So far she is very happy with this phone. I was little bit concerned with the fact that you need to unlock the phone with american sim before using it with any other card. But the process went smoothly.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone works great, love the phone, with it being unlocked you do lose a couple features such as the ability to use Samsung Pay. But if you can live without a couple features you'll love the phone"
yes,no,no,They didn't tell me that the nano SIM card is not included so you have to go purchase it separately. Otherwise the phone is ok
no,no,yes,Can u use unlocked phone for boost mobile?
yes,yes,yes,[...] Youtube Video Samsung Galaxy S6 User Review Plus Battery Test
yes,yes,yes,T-mobil phone But i love it
no,no,yes,I cheated the box came empty. my money back
yes,yes,yes,Its a great phone! Only thing I don't like is the platinum color which I explain further below. I switched from the IPhone 6s to this phone and have no regrets. First of all the screen resolution and camera quality is no comparison to iPhone or even the newest HTC.
yes,yes,yes,Wife really likes her birthday present!
no,no,no,Can this phone work on Canadian Carriers? Fido
no,yes,yes,"Sorry, this rating is not for Galaxy S6, but for this particular model SM-G920I which can NOT be registered in USA. You can use it -- like I am using it with T-Mobile -- but your IMEI will be rejected by Samsung website and you cannot use things like Samsung Pay. This is very disappointing."
no,no,no,Sometimes the screen touch pad doesn't work and sometimes screen is freezing and I must restart.I was sorry for buy. I'm saying to everyone please don't buy this product...
no,yes,no,"This was a Christmas present from my son. On the back of the box is stated, ""American SIM card only"". However, product was advertised as unlocked and international. We live in Singapore and just put in a new SIM card and it was asking for the unlock code. The Singapore unlock code would not work."
no,no,no,Im having problems because the phone is unresponsive at times screen and buttons
yes,yes,yes,Excellent! I recommend it
yes,yes,yes,I have nothing negative to say about this phone. It is Awesome! The best smart phone I have ever owned. No problems with setting it up and easy to use.
yes,no,yes,You cant make video calls on it though.
no,yes,yes,Product was good overall but the person on the other end could not hear while on speaker... was definitely not a network issue.
yes,yes,yes,Best phone ever made!
yes,yes,yes,Works as it should. As described.
yes,yes,yes,Very good cell phones everthing that I need and wanted .
no,no,no,The touch screen stopped responding after a 7 months. I tried calling samsung to have it repaired with my warranty and was told the phone was from Singapore and that I had to contact Singapore or ship it there without being told the number of the address.
no,yes,yes,Camera broke 3 week after I got the phone.
no,yes,yes,"i bought when it when i was in Maryland, it worked well but when i got to my home country in Jamaica it keep shutting down, for no reason and is not liked it wanted to charge i think the battery was just too weak."
yes,yes,yes,I love it! great price!
yes,yes,yes,There are two kinds of people...Galaxy people and Iphone people. I really wanted to be a Galaxy person like half my family because Apple irritates me and the prices are ridiculous.
yes,yes,yes,This phone has the best camera I have ever seen on a phone. It has replaced so many gadgets in my purse. Samsung did everything right when making this phone. I will hold on to it until it dies on me.
yes,yes,yes,"Works well so far, no complaints."
yes,yes,yes,Im in love with this phone. I was surprised to learn that there wasnt a need for a sd card.
no,no,yes,LED screen went out after three weeks of use.
no,no,no,"Product stop working 4 months after I purchased it, the after waiting days for a response they say all phones come with a 30 day warranty smh DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY"
no,no,no,I purchased an unlocked phone and got a locked phone and had to spend another $60 to unlock it. Very disappointed considering I do not live in the country to return it.
no,yes,no,DO BOT BUY!!! Mine came with a broken screen and won't turn on! Waisted $500 and for some reason won't let me return or get refund!
yes,yes,yes,"After upgrading phones every 6 months or so, I find that the Samsung Galaxy S6 is the best smartphone on the market. It's got a great style with its Gorilla Glass 4 front--and back. The thinness and overall look of the phone makes it standout. This phone is even thinner than the Apple iPhone 6!"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. The packaging did not appear to be tampered with and once my SIM card was cut to the right size I was able to use the phone right away.
yes,yes,yes,"I feel I am uniquely qualified to review this phone. I'm what you call OS agnostic. No, I will not be preaching how iOS is superior to Android or visa-versa. But I own a large assortment of devices on both sides."
yes,yes,yes,Top of the line cell phone. Met all my expectations. Very well priced. Having a blast with this phone!
yes,yes,yes,I received my new phone yesterday I absolutely love it I was needing an upgrade as I already have work off of a samsung galaxy it was just a lower grade it was the two samsung galaxy I really am going to enjoy this phone totally
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent Phone! I love everything about it, and so will you!"
yes,yes,yes,An excellent smartphone. Easy to use. All functions are superior
no,yes,no,Très bon produit sauf l'appareil était locked
no,yes,yes,Fingerprint does not work as well as the one I tried in the Samsung store. It only works about half the time. Battery drains way faster than my roommate's S6 which bougth 6 month ago with the same setting.
yes,yes,yes,the best phone i ever bought.
yes,yes,yes,love the phone it came on time
yes,yes,yes,"Really happy with this phone. It took a bit of time to get used to it because I was using an iPhone before, but after playing with it for a little bit I became more and more comfortable with it. The phone is fast and the screen is wonderful to look at. I would easily recommend this to anyone"
no,yes,yes,Phone is brand new still in its shrink wrap. For those experiencing fast battery drop it's due to the updates and most likely the phone e sitting on shelf for a while. After all it is a 2015 model. I'd you can't connect to the wifi your router is blocling it. Has nothing to do with the phone itself.
no,no,no,I faced problem screen overlay all time.it makes crazy.
yes,yes,yes,Every other thing was good except delivery.
no,no,no,The phone did not receive Canadian signals and no SIM card would work. Took it to a Samsung technician and told me that the phone was sent from Germany and would not work here at all. be careful when buying from cosmos planet. I am still waiting for my refund after a week they received the phone.
yes,yes,yes,"Very good phone. Really the SM-G920F. It come with a British AC adaptor but they add a US adaptor. The signal strengh is weaker than with the SM-G920W8 (the Galaxy S6 sold by Telus, Bell, Rogers...) but it still work quite well. The is the only reason I didn't gave 5 stars!"
yes,no,yes,"Phone came in new and perfect working condition. It arrived on the first day of the estimated shipping date. Only flaw was that the ""quick charger"" it came with cannot be used in Canada.. it is meant for Europe or Asia.."
yes,yes,yes,"This is my second samsung phone it's great! Has amazing battery life and the fast charging cable makes it easy to charge in a rush! Android platform works flawless,wifi,buetooth both work great! Lots of special features that are great added touches! Still learning!"
yes,yes,yes,Reception is indeed weaker but only slightly (maybe 1 bar) weaker. Everything else about the phone is great though. They even included an adapter to use the UK fast charger.
yes,yes,yes,"Very Good Phone. Fast, lightweight and excellent construction. I only miss the radio and the SD lot."
yes,yes,yes,Purchased this phone about 2 months ago from my local phone dealer and it was definitely one of the best phones I've ever had! It certainly met my needs and more. The software of this phone has been upgraded from the past generations to absolute perfection.
yes,yes,yes,Worked fine for a month then couldn't even use it
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing product. Samsung nailed it, probably the best smartphone you can find in the market."
yes,yes,yes,AS ADVERTISED;GOOD PHONE;SHIPPING VERY FAST;GOOD PRICE;VERY PLEASED 4 1/2 STARS OVERALL;
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful and shiny. Love this phone.
yes,yes,yes,"mefiez vous de ce vendeur, j'ai achetÉ un telephone samsung galaxy s6 mais ils m'ont anarquer le telephone etait defectueux et pourtant ils ont dit c'etait flambant neuf apres enquete j'ai apris qu'Il m'ont vendu un telephone declaré volé cest grave"
yes,yes,yes,The best phone ever.
no,yes,yes,Fingerprint security.It only works maybe 1 out a 100 tryst. You are then forced to use your password to open your phone
yes,yes,yes,Excellent product.
yes,no,no,Was exactly what I was looking for. Shipping to p.o box's a bit slow but did get the phone. Wanted and recieved the Canadian version not the international version. I'm a Rogers customer and the phone was actually a Rogers device.
no,yes,yes,"It's not the real price! If you buy it on Rogers.ca, you can have it for 750$. So, you don't have a rebate of 262.74$, but barely 12.75!"
no,yes,no,"Beware for those buying a ""new"" phone that the phone has already been altered and rooted to be unlocked. I was not able to access certain apps like snapchat and was not able to install or even search for android updates because it says your phone has been modified."
yes,no,yes,I have had several problems with this phone...
yes,yes,yes,C' est tres bon. Merci
yes,yes,yes,Very pleased with my purchase. Am excellent phone. Easy to set up. Everything included in box. No hassle. Would recommend.
yes,yes,yes,"Mine is from the UK, but functions very well."
yes,yes,no,I bought this for my wife and I am not disappointed
yes,yes,yes,Phone is exactly what was advertised. The shipping said estimate delivery March 3-8 but came 2 days sooner! I couldn't be happier with my purchase
yes,yes,yes,Battery needs charged 3 times a day but otherwise great phone
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and basically new for almost 50% in store prices! Happy customer!
no,yes,yes,This was a good buy for the money except that the phone sometimes freezes for a few minutes then returns to normal
yes,yes,yes,Great product my spouse is happy with it.
no,no,no,Product doesn't work after three days of turning him on... it just doesn't even turn on now so expensive and doesn't work unbelievable!
yes,yes,yes,"Have had this over a year now and absolutely love it. Was way cheaper on here than in the shops. The gold is so beautiful, especially the back as it is very glossy and shiny. Very quick, decent memory (although I have to keep pics on a separate card..."
no,yes,no,"Worked well for a year. Then became faulty, espically the screen, due to over heating and Samsung expect me to pay. Very disappointing."
yes,yes,yes,"Arrived in one day, perfect item!"
yes,yes,yes,I bought this to replace my S4 and it doesn't disappoint. Easy to use with a great camera - I love it.
yes,yes,yes,Love this phone! Camera is just amazing!!!!! And plenty of storage
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, the screen is sharp and responsive. Build quality is excellent"
yes,yes,yes,Very good galaxy Samsung phone
yes,yes,yes,"very happy , it looks new to me.Not connected yet but it seems an interesting piece of equipment to me."
no,no,no,Found it better to buy a high spec phone outright than an inferior phone locked into a contract
no,no,yes,"You think for the price, they'd be able to figure out the battery problem. After a year or so of pretty moderate usage and not charging it overnight, my battery is sporadic and temperamental. I have to carry around a portable charger at all times. If not, I charge the thing at least twice a day."
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone, no complaints."
yes,yes,yes,This phone is the best
no,yes,no,the device stops working if only one flashing light on the top display of the device
yes,yes,yes,"Just changed from Apple to Samsung, getting used to the difference but happy up to yet"
no,yes,yes,"The product arrived in seemingly okay condition. After owning the phone for a reasonable period, I realise that the phone has been rooted, to a state where high street retailers wouldn't deem it acceptable to sell."
yes,yes,yes,Love mine great phone and it is the best Samung galaxy phone that I have ever had and it changes up fast too
yes,yes,yes,"Brilliant phone, have been using it for almost 2 years now. Just excellent."
yes,yes,yes,"The phone its self is really good quality, however having paid extra for a faster delivery my delivery dates been pushed back twice"
yes,yes,yes,Great phone and comes in all the proper packaging
yes,yes,yes,I'm really pleased with the Galaxy S6. It arrived promptly and I soon had it set up. I find it very easy to use and it's quick. The camera's nice and takes good photos. It was a really good buy.
yes,yes,yes,Battery it's a lost cause! Rest it's fine!
no,no,no,Just over a year later and battery hasn't kept charge for the last 4months. 100% charge to 70% within 1hr from coming off charge. Now won't charge at all and feeling like its gonna catch fire if left to charge to long!!!!
yes,yes,yes,So far this phone works ok and as intended Thank you Manuel
yes,yes,yes,Better than an iphone and even better than a Galaxy S7 (doesn't explode in your pocket). Get it now.
no,yes,no,"this must be a faulty version. the sound gets choppy sometimes, it restarts or closes without any notice. I was expecting better reliability from samsung."
yes,yes,yes,i have one which i bought there really good they even have a finger scanner which is helpful
yes,yes,yes,"Jury is still out but no complaints so far. I got attached to my S3 as I've had it years I just hope this lives up to expectations. It's lighter, slimmer and offers all the old apps and appears to be a genuine product and was very pleased with the price"
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. Bought to replace trusty S4 which lasted 5 years.
yes,yes,yes,"The phone works well when it works! BUT, it frequently crashes. sometimes it can be restarted ok but on other occasions it will not restart unless plugged into the charger. When I do that, I typically find that the battery still has at least 50% charge. In other words, it should not need recharging."
yes,yes,yes,"brought as Christmas present, looks good, nice colour, one star deducted as no SD card slot and no user replaceable battery unlike the S5 which is also waterproof"
yes,yes,yes,Absolutely great. I think the strategy of buying an older model really works well.
no,no,no,Died after 3 months and 3 days. Zero stars
yes,yes,yes,very good quality smart phone
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone indeed
no,no,no,I received a empty box.
yes,yes,yes,"Phone still going strong and no complaints, great buy and kept the girl happy! Better buying here than any retail shop!"
yes,yes,yes,Awesome Fantastic Photos Best Ever Great Battery Life So Easy To Use
yes,yes,yes,Pros: Camera is the best I've ever used on a phone. Screen is gorgeous with different colour profiles selectable. Fast charge feature is really useful. Best 64bit mobile processor on the market right now (I managed 68734 on antutu). Loud speaker is good. Fingerprint scanner is flawless.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, It lives up to all it's hype. Its the 4K video that most impresses me, Its excellent quality. The phone itself is light and feels thinner than previous galaxy phones. Very happy with the purchase."
yes,yes,yes,"Since shifting camp from iPhones have been using android phones for a year and a half now. During this time I have owned HTC One, HTC One M8 and a Nexus 5. I also had a Samsung Galaxy tablet."
no,no,no,This is a poor quality item
yes,yes,yes,Good product! Glad I finally found a decent protector for the edge!
no,no,no,Not responsive at all. Facebook was laging right out of the box with nothing else installed on the device that could potentially slow it down. Cameras are alright. Battery is terrible compared to Z3. 2 days with barely using it compared to 3 days with Z3. Touch ID was cool.
yes,yes,yes,"Simple the best phone out. Incredible phone, extremely fast, amazing camera. Glad I sold my iPhone 6 now. Amazing"
yes,no,yes,"Avoid like the plague, non removable battery and no SD slot."
no,yes,yes,I was about to buy one of these - but according to the the latest news just in they have a major security vulnerability - that allows a hacker complete access to your logins and even the camera.
yes,yes,yes,"I love the phone and particularly the glossy finish. Gold color makes it even shinier. The battery seems to last only a day for me, although I suspect it has something to do with the apps I have."
yes,no,yes,"Looks good and love the wireless charging but overall a downward step from my S5. Poor battery life and now I can't change my battery nor add storage, reasons why I dumped Apple. Instead of a heavy Power Bank I kept a spare battery for times when I needed it. My S5 lasted a few days sometimes."
yes,yes,yes,"Finally decided to retire my nexus 5 and purchased the S6 over the G4 and the M9. Has a fantastic screen, great camera and a battery life much better than the nexus 5. Very thin and feels great in the hand (be careful it is a little slippery)."
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone - the best part is the camera. Just been away for 2 weeks and the footage that comes off it is amazing.
yes,yes,yes,"Very nice Samsung phone, better than the S5. In fact I always buy Samsung and this is the best. I would highly recomment this phone. Loveit. But remember the back does not come off so the battery is sealed. Also the back is glass as well. Treat with care."
no,yes,no,The only failing is the poor battery life.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent quality and works really well
yes,yes,yes,Best phone ive ever had. Absolutely no lag. Just a beautiful phone. You will not regret buying this phone
yes,yes,yes,Excellent my daughter was very happy on her birthday good packageing lovely phone thank you
yes,yes,yes,"So far I can't fault it,very fast, looks great, the camera is absolutely stunning and a beautiful display. Battery life is poor (this was expected) but being new I have been downloading apps using the camera and doing updates (5-6hrs) but I imagine (hope) it will be fine for normal use."
yes,yes,yes,"Let me start by saying I've owned my fair-share of smartphones including the Galaxy S3, S4, S5, Mega, Note 2 and iPhone 4, 4s, 5, and 6. However, I have never been so pleased with a smartphone until I picked up a Galaxy S6 a few days ago."
yes,yes,yes,"Very well built phone, excellent specs too. Cannot fault, TouchWiz is no longer bloated and horrible, very little unwanted features and some nice additions."
yes,yes,yes,Great stuff..thanks
no,yes,no,Phone was received resealed - e.g. it was used by someone else first and then resealed by Samsung. I know this because some of the settings were still in Italian and I had to perform a factory reset. The phone however is genuine and works properly.
yes,yes,yes,"Just replaced my S4 with an S6 and what a difference. Snappy, great battery life, and uncluttered by Network bloatware."
yes,yes,yes,The first thing you notice about the phone is that no longer does the Galaxy feel like a cheap bit of plastic :-) and having not ventured near an Android/Samsung device for a while this was a big draw.
yes,yes,yes,Has potential to be a great phone but software is full of glitches
yes,yes,yes,"Fantastic phone, the phone feels great in the hand, the screen is amazing.The phone has really good build quality, i got this phone to replace my sony Xperia Z3 and that was the best decision i made. I haven't put the phone down since receiving the device."
yes,yes,yes,"Only had the phone for two days, but over the moon with it so far."
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful. I just love this but find it difficult to bring to mind anything others have not said. Just read the reviews and drool. You do want one.
yes,yes,yes,Great buy this phone love it always get worried when laying out money for expensive phones online but from start of purchase to me receiving it was exceptional service from the sellar
yes,yes,yes,love phone better than samsung 5
yes,yes,yes,"Great deliver, quality phone"
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent product...works good. Great delivery before time, very happy."
yes,no,yes,Why is that after just 2 days the price significantly dropped from 424 to 369?
yes,yes,yes,"The one star is NOT for the phone, (the Samson Galaxy S6 Flat, is a great phone) but for the version I was sent. According to Samsung, the model I was sent was not suitable for the European market, and came without Samsung's guarantee."
yes,yes,yes,"I've always had IPhones but decided to go mad and change to the Samsung Galaxy S6 I've only had it 24 hours but already know I will never go back to an Iphone, it's awesome and I love it."
no,no,no,received in the morning and self restarted before i finish the guide settings. factory reset doesn't help solve the problem. its been in my hand for 6 hours and restarted like 10 more times.
yes,yes,yes,Really good phone came bang on time.
yes,yes,yes,the s6 is a great phone the screen quality is the best I've ever seen on a phone and I've tried a lot of phones its fast and runs smooth and i like the new design I'm very pleased with the phone the battery isn't as bad as people make out plus you have fast charge that works really well you won't...
yes,yes,yes,"The phone arrived as scheduled and in new condition as advertised although not genuine UK but made for Ukraine (Kyivstar) instead . The phone fast, responsive, and satisfied my expectations so I have nothing to complain about the phone itself."
yes,yes,yes,Phone is everything it's made out to be the camera is first class. The stylish case is comfortable to use and carry.
yes,yes,yes,Beautiful phone. Was a bit worried about what the gold would be like but it's fabulous. I love it.
yes,yes,yes,I love it. I wasn't expecting much difference between this and the LG G3 that I was upgrading from.....however it is a totally different class. In short; it's awesome.
yes,yes,yes,"When I first received this phone I was impressed by the look and build quality, however, things started to go downhill from there. I'll start by saying that the display and the camera are fantastic. I've never seen such good pictures taken on a phone before."
yes,yes,yes,"Although is phone came from the UAE it arrived quite quickly. The phone itself is great and started up in English so no need to change the language. The charger was suitable for UK sockets, although an adapter was provided."
no,yes,no,The phone was faulty. Had it less than one day and some strange black lines appears on the screen. Am returning this phone for my money.
yes,yes,yes,Magic fantastic .now just got to get to grips with it .its amazing just a a beautiful Lady put it dose has its told thanks for your great service.also the price is the best you will find Thanks once again keep up your great work magic.
no,no,no,The phone is ok not 100percent what I wanted. I think keys are linked to the wrong characters as when you type in words it forever underlines them as if the are wrong. Also if you press a certain button e.g. a smiley emoji face it could be a smiley face. I believe there is some type of error.
yes,yes,yes,Most manufacturers are trying to extend battery life. Samsung decided to half the battery life on the S6. Mine does not last a day before it needs recharging. You can not extend memory with a micro SD card. Much is made of the camera. I can see no difference between my S6 and my wife's S3.
yes,yes,yes,Samsung at their best.
yes,yes,yes,"I had 2 of these devices one to replace the other, both of which got aren't back in the end. The first one had a home button that wouldn't register a clock about 20% of the time on first press."
yes,yes,yes,"Made the jump from an iPhone 4s I had for a long time. Couldn't be happier with the phone, quality feel to it, extremely fast running apps, great sound, and packed with features. Also the camera is fantastic. Would definitely recommend to anyone"
yes,yes,yes,Come on time and it was really good packed item.it was good quality
yes,yes,yes,I love my new phone
yes,yes,yes,Thank you seller for this item.item described excellent phone delivered very fast.would definitely buy from you again.love my phone I'm very happy with it.
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic Phone. Perfection.
yes,yes,yes,"Upgraded to this from htc one after reading all the reviews rating it as the best smartphone this year. I have to say I don't understand all the hype. Positives are great screen size and nice looking handset, camera very good indeed, negatives are wifi keeps dropping out, battery awful but does..."
yes,yes,yes,Nice mobile. Camera is just awesome..
no,yes,yes,"Great looking device, starts off fast but then it starts to lag. Touchwiz looks amateurish. Battery life drains like mad."
yes,yes,yes,I like it so far. Big upgrade from my S2. Charge the phone everyday but that's only because I like to have my phones fully charged before I set off to work. I'm not a heavy user so the battery life is not a problem for me. I'm still getting used to the functionality there's alot to learn.
yes,yes,yes,Great and gorgeous!
yes,yes,yes,"Love it. Looks great, runs beautifully, and I'm really enjoying all the extra features (just found the Peel remote built-in app - great!) and haven't even dug into some of the fundamentals like the camera yet."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic service! Amazing phone! Great price!
yes,yes,yes,Great phone . Battery needs to be improved
yes,yes,yes,"Amazing phone, loads of new features, definitely better than an iPhone only one downside is the battery life isn't as long as expected but other than that it's amazing"
yes,yes,yes,This phone is fantastic i upgraded from a iphone 5s to this phone around 3 weeks ago and just wow. The iphone is nothing at all compared to this phone. The quality is amazing its quad HD and it looks a ton better than my computer monitor which is new and recent. This phone is great.
yes,yes,yes,Bought for my Partner's birthday. He seems pretty pleased with it
no,yes,no,defective no wonder its a warehouseitem
yes,yes,yes,Excellent phone. Looks and feels great. As a first proper high end smart phone - this is a tremendous upgrade.
yes,yes,yes,Everything I need from a Smartphone and with better than expected battery life.
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone. Powerful, wonderful screen. The camera is about the best available in a phone but is a little slow to load. Manages audio and video files really well. The sound from the speakers is pretty good but doesn't quite match the HTC's. Fingerprint reader is excellent."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought this as a Christmas gift for my father who lives abroad. Initially I was a little worried the phone might be region locked, however was very happy to discover it is not. My father loves the phone so much. It is sleek and beautiful, very modern and surprisingly light."
yes,yes,yes,"This phone is brilliant, exactly what I wanted, it's quick to open everything , going from a word document to taking a picture to opening emails are instant ..no problems what's so ever .....love it"
yes,yes,yes,lovely phone very smart lots apps
yes,no,yes,"Phone did not come as Sim-free as advertised. The screen got cracked in the 3rd week of my purchase (falling from 40 cm height). I got it repaired and 1 week later it cracked (without fall) again. All that time I was using protectors (first, original samsung clear view cover."
yes,yes,yes,"My first Samsung phone and I love it! I've played around with an S4 and S5 before but their performance and user experience was quite bad (for me at least) and they had lots of bloatware (I've only used Google Nexus phones before so I was used to clean, stock Android)."
yes,yes,yes,Great looking and performing phone
yes,yes,yes,"If you like Samsung smart phones, this is the ultimate so far!"
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent value for money, works great. You won't be disappointed with this at all."
yes,yes,yes,This is not genuine.
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone I have ever had, this is by far the best phone i have ever used after using apple devices for a few years i have discovered how good samsung devices however the only issue i am having with this almost perfect device is that if you are a heavy user much like myself and use apps which use..."
yes,yes,yes,As described and significantly cheaper at time of purchase than other sellers. UK model
no,no,no,"I was enjoying this phone until I dropped it ONCE and the screen cracked all the way across. So much for Gorilla Glass. Other phones I have had have survived much worse falls with little more than minor scratches. Get a very good case if you buy this phone, because it breaks very easily."
yes,no,yes,The Jedi of phones. The force is strong in this one. Match it with a juice stick and all the whining I did on the lack of a removable battery came to nought.
yes,yes,yes,Have owned this phone since its release day so have spent some quality time with the phone. Build: Finally a flagship build that was long overdue. The glass and metal combination is very smooth to the touch but does make the phone more slippery in hand.
yes,yes,yes,"great phone, does everything I want it to do. it can be somewhat cumbersome for anyone with smaller hands (like my kids). well worth the money in my opinion"
yes,yes,yes,The item came on time and was quick to set up and run. It looks and feels good and has operated well since I received it about five days ago.
no,no,no,"This is not a bad phone unlocked in U.K, Emails set up. Only thing with Galaxy S6's and Edge are that you cannot put a SD mini memory card in the phone. So buy wisely - Purchase a handset with the amount of memory that will be suitable for you."
yes,yes,yes,My perfect boyfriend got me this for my 21st birthday great prezzie
yes,yes,yes,As described. Beautiful sleek looks
yes,yes,yes,Superb phone. It actually beats my laptop. Very happy about this purchase.
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone. It's fast, has a crystal clear HD screen and a smart, high quality finish. Definitely built to rival the iPhone 6."
yes,yes,yes,Love it. A million times. Most excellent camera. Highly recommended
yes,yes,yes,I purchased this phone and received Samsung galaxy s6 It's not edge
yes,yes,yes,"Simply, the best phone i've ever owned. i had Iphone and galaxy note 3 previously, and this is THE best phone so far in this time and era. wow. very fast performance, So striaghtforward of options to use."
yes,yes,yes,Lovely neat phone at a great price - beats the high street by at least £75... (at time of purchase.)
yes,yes,yes,"Beautiful phone. Gold is the best colour. Keypad is so easy to write with, the feel of the phone, sound is brilliant. And the phone is really fast. Was a winner with the wife. It is a wonderful gift to give."
yes,yes,yes,"Best phone ever, if you don't care about removable battery and sd card slot, then this phone is perfect for you if you want an amazing golden phone."
yes,yes,yes,"Brilliant. Fantastic. Feels good in the hands and futuristic. I was slightly concerned about battery performance before I bought, but no need to worry at all. I leave home around 7 AM and use 4G for the whole day. The battery would be still 40% remaining when I come home around 7PM."
yes,yes,yes,"I bought the Samsung S3 a few years ago and it has served me well. Brilliant phone. I replaced the S3 with this Samsung Galaxy S6 just a month ago. This phone is perfect. Brilliant clear screen, superfast wi fi connection. Fantastic camera. Brilliant storage. Better by far than my husbands iPhone."
yes,yes,yes,"Fast, excellent camera, reasonable battery life. Possibly the worlds best phone right now."
yes,yes,yes,Fantastic phone with great value of money
yes,yes,yes,"If you're not wedded to iPhones, this is the route to travel. Brilliant screen quality. All the usual Android features. Fingerprint log-on can be a bit hit or miss but you have a back-up password if your fingerprint (apparently) changes.... Cordless charging brilliant."
yes,yes,yes,good phone. its best among all smartphones. the price is also nice. dont hesitate. believe me!
yes,yes,yes,Brilliant service and the phone is as expected from the manufacturer. Had it a couple of months now and had no problems whatsoever.
no,yes,yes,If I will use it for a european country (Germany) can I get the 2 pin charger?
yes,yes,yes,Lovely phone can't fault it on anything
yes,no,yes,"Used straight out of the box and I am a complete novice, size is great and not too big to carry around. Its really good to have a keyboard where you don't press 3 keys at once"
yes,yes,yes,Initial concerns over battery life not meeting specification or expectations. But after a few weeks this is now working well and lasting a full day even with fairly heavy use for calls and Apps.
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, delivered in the time window promised. Best phone ever."
yes,yes,yes,"Good phone, although the listing says it's from Uk its from UAE."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, easy to use and ca,era is wonderful."
yes,yes,yes,The more I use it the better it gets. Glad it came with a free wireless charger as I would have been upset to have paid money for it. Charges faster on the lead so why use wireless? Good camera and screen. Oh... and you can use it as a phone too....
yes,yes,yes,Does what it says on the box. Truly is a UK version but the plug foxed me for a moment as it has to be extended. A very good working unit.
yes,yes,yes,Quality product. Very happy
yes,yes,yes,Super smart phone built with advance function and features
yes,yes,yes,Bought for wife... She had Iphone... Now she has a smart phone. She says it's a really great phone.
yes,yes,yes,Amazing phone that was delivered perfectly the next day. Stunning design as it is has glass on both sides. The features are excellent for multi taskers as you can open up pop ups.
yes,yes,yes,Really nice phone. no trouble with setting it up.
yes,no,yes,"Bad battery life. For the rest, great smartphone."
yes,yes,yes,Love the Samsung easy to use and understand first class would recommend
yes,yes,yes,I love the phone it's a great phone
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone, but fast charger was not bundled with the phone; just a regular charger. Everyone else's phone seems to come bundled so why do I get a regular charger??"
yes,yes,yes,The phone is working good
no,no,no,Received phone with faluty loose home button will send it back! southeast asian sim card only
no,yes,yes,"Had so many delivery dates and the phone just wont come, very dissappointed after spending £390"
yes,yes,yes,"Fast - but not slick - little glitches all over the place: 1. Fingerprint security VERY unreliable - and therefore, most irritating. Had to disable it before I threw the phone out the window. 2. Many of the apps just don't work as smoothly as the ones on my wifes iPhone 5 3."
yes,yes,yes,delivery took time but product came as expected . Phone works well .
yes,yes,yes,"This was my first phone... ...And as far as phones go, it's incredible. On paper, it has an octa-core processor, 3 Gigs or RAM, a fingerprint sensor, heart rate monitor and a 16MP rear camera. But the best part of this phone is it's stunning 1440p display."
yes,yes,yes,"Purchased phone in afternoon delivered 10 am next day. All up and running within minutes. Great service. Phone up and running could not b happier, both with the phone and service"
yes,yes,yes,"Absolutely stilish, handy and VERY fast working and charging! Strongly recommended!!! Best phone this year!"
yes,yes,yes,"I'm not being funny but I don't see what it is about this fone. Samsung Galaxy S4 was more efficient for me because I could do with one or two functions they've removed from s6. 1. On s4 galaxy, you could touch and hold a song and set it as a ringtone, on s6 you can't."
yes,yes,yes,"Great phone. Really like the way it is so easy to use. Had a S3 before which was slowing down, this is a great upgrade."
no,no,no,"I've had this phone for less than a year now and already had the first issues with it. First the vibration isn't working as it should for phone calls. I took my phone to both my carrier, who said it would take 30 days to get it fixed, and also to the Samsung store who said it would take 2 weeks."
yes,yes,yes,"perfect phone, smooth and fast."
yes,yes,yes,"Excellent phone quite a step up from the S5 but very slippery to hold would recommend a cover of some sort, I have a see through thin plastic cover which doesn't spoil it's good looks, All in all a superb phone"
yes,yes,yes,Best phone I've had.
no,no,no,"The Main camera broke after a few days in that it was always blurry, none of the 'fixes' provided on the internet would resolve it therefore the unit had to be returned."
yes,yes,yes,This is my second Samsung phone (after the Genio Qwerty many years ago!) and I have to say I'm rather happy with it. Initially there was a lot to worry about. Mainly over Touchwiz and a smaller battery. But I'm glad to say that neither have been a problem so far.
yes,yes,yes,"Good quality, nice and stylish"
yes,no,yes,Made a list of features that were a must have for me and was surprised as I hadn't considered a Samsung. Lack of microSD slot or removable battery is not an issue for me as my HTC One M7 had neither and I didn't miss them.
yes,yes,yes,Loving the phone and despatched promptly
no,no,no,"I am pretty disappointed with the battery life, I constantly have to keep turning off and on again as it hangs, volume of calls are low. I was expecting more I might revert back to iPhone"
yes,yes,yes,"What I expect from a phone - Easy and quick texting and phone calls - Convenient and quick use of the internet - Good battery life (as in, I don't expect the phone to die after 2 hours usage, like the iphone 5 does) - Whilst I am not overly fussy, having a decent camera and music player is a bonus..."
yes,yes,yes,Great phone. So much faster than my old s3. So glad I chose this against the iPhone.
yes,yes,yes,Excellent if you realy need something like this to carry around.
yes,yes,yes,I don't need to tell you how awesome this phone is because I'm sure you already know! Unfortunately Samsung continues to (almost) ruin there smartphones with all the bloatwear! Admittedly there are some things I really like about touchwiz but there is so much unnecessary rubbish which takes up alot...
yes,yes,yes,"Only had this a week so just getting used to it but I like it already. Bought with a Spigen case, wireless charger and glass screen protector for just under £400 so a decent price. Previous phone was a Nokia Lumia 925 and I was considering another Windows phone but the top model was nearly as old as..."
yes,yes,yes,Battery Life could be better
yes,yes,yes,One week on from receiving my brand new Samsung Galaxy S6 32GB and I am loving life! It is a remarkable piece of kit and I am very happy with it. I am enjoying finding out just what the S6 is capable of and discovering its many useful attributes such as the 'Do Not Disturb' feature and I like the...
yes,no,yes,It's OK. The battery is not good at all
